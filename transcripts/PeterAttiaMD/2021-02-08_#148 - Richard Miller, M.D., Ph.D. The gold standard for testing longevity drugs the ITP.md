## Description

Richard Miller is a professor of pathology and the Director of the Center for Aging Research at the University of Michigan. He is one of the architects of the NIA-funded Interventions Testing Programs (ITPs) animal study test protocol. In this episode, Rich goes through the results of the long list of molecules tested by the ITP—including rapamycin, metformin, nicotinamide riboside, an SGLT-2 inhibitor called canagliflozin, and more. Many of the discussed outcomes have had surprising outcomes—both positive and negative findings.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Richard Miller:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Richard Miller discussing the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), a rigorous scientific framework for testing compounds that might extend lifespan in mice. The ITP represents the gold standard for evaluating potential longevity drugs, running concurrent studies at three sites using genetically heterogeneous mice. The discussion covers numerous compounds tested over nearly two decades, including both successes (rapamycin, acarbose) and failures (resveratrol, metformin).

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- ITP uses genetically heterogeneous mice to ensure results are not strain-specific [00:45:00]
- Studies are conducted at three sites simultaneously for reproducibility [00:40:00]
- Rapamycin showed 9% lifespan extension in males, 14% in females [01:15:00]
- Females show higher blood levels of rapamycin than males (2-3x) [01:20:00]
- About 80% of mice die from cancer in both control and treatment groups [01:45:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider interventions that work even when started in middle age [01:55:00]
- Pay attention to sex-specific responses to interventions [02:00:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Glucose control appears more important for males than females [01:40:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Rapamycin: Most consistent life-extending drug in ITP [01:15:00]
- Acarbose: Extends lifespan primarily in males [01:25:00]
- Metformin: Failed to show benefit in ITP despite human data [01:50:00]
- 17-alpha estradiol: Extends lifespan in males only [01:35:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The ITP represents effectively the gold standard of testing molecules for longevity" [00:15:00]

"Aging is malleable - that's the question that matters" [01:00:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. Why do some interventions work better in one sex versus the other?
2. What is the optimal timing for starting anti-aging interventions?
3. How do the mouse models translate to human aging given different primary causes of death?

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is richard miller rich is a professor of pathology at the university of michigan and the director of michigan's paul f glenn center for aging research he served in a variety of editorial and advisory positions on behalf of the american federation for aging research afar and the national institutes of aging nia which we talk about a little bit he's also served as the editor in chief of aging cell he's the recipient of the nathan shock award and the allied signal award the irving wright award and an award from the glenn foundation along with a number of other awards for aging research dr miller's research focuses on the problems of the basic biologies of aging mostly in mice but sometimes using other cell lines though we speak in this podcast almost exclusively about one of the amazing products of his life's work called the nia funded interventions testing programs the itps now over time you'll probably hear me or you have heard me talk about the itps on various podcasts certainly with respect to the podcasts around rapamycin and metformin the itps are a set of studies that are done concurrently in three labs the jackson labs rich miller's lab in michigan and randy strong's lab in ut san antonio we go into great detail about what the criteria are and how these are done but suffice it to say that based on the types of mice that are used and the rigor with which these are done statistically and otherwise the itps represent effectively the gold standard of testing molecules for longevity in arguably the most important subset of mice we could study and basically what we do in this podcast is go through the long list of molecules that have been tested what the results were a number of these are quite surprising they're all very interesting both in positive and negative findings i've been looking forward to speaking with rich for about a year but the reason we delayed this until now is i wanted to make sure that a couple of the findings that were in the pipeline were close enough to publication that we could speak about them confidently and this podcast can now be released as soon as those manuscripts have been accepted in particular one around an sglt2 inhibitor and another one around nicotinamide riboside which is a very popular supplement that many people ask about as a precursor to nad so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr rich miller [Music] rich thank you so much for making time to chat today i've been looking forward to this one for almost a year now but we we wanted to wait until some of these exciting results we're going to get to were far enough outside the pipeline that we could speak about them good to chat with you but i think before we get to the most recent findings of the itp and even explaining what an itp is i i want to give people a bit of a sense of who you are and how you've played kind of an amazing role in the field of longevity along with a couple of your colleagues so where'd you grow up by the way i was born in philadelphia and when we were five my mom and dad moved me and my two brothers to the northern suburbs of philadelphia cheltenham township i went to high school with ben netanyahu of all people who wow joined our soccer team as a sophomore i was just born slightly too late if if i'd been born three years earlier i would have had reggie jackson as a teammate wow interesting split your loyalties there between uh what city you're gonna choose for sports so when did you take an interest in science growing up when i was about five that's pretty unusual for a five-year-old right well i really liked science i was decent at school and i always liked getting good grades and stuff like that and i decided early on that aging was bad for you it made people sick and then die i was kind of against that and the best way to fight against that was to learn something about aging and to develop ways of slowing the aging process down so you can't do that unless you're a scientist so you end up doing your md and phd degrees at yale in the 1970s at that time i think you went off and did a postdoc at msk is that correct memorial sloan kettering yes that's exactly right i actually did a postdoc for three years first at harvard which did not work out at all and then i was rescued by a mentor at songkettering tell me more about what you mean that it didn't work out at all the first part i don't want to be sued for slander but let's just say that my postdoctoral mentor had some defects as a mentor and i wasn't very productive and he wasn't very happy with me and i wasn't very happy with him so as a beginning postdoc you're always scared of offending the big boss and you tend to put off the decision to leave as long as you possibly can and eventually we both got fed up with one another and so i moved to sloan kettering where things went better did your field of study change when you made that switch it changed not at that point but at the beginning of my postdoc i knew i'd always wanted to work on aging and the phd project that i worked on was involved somatic cell hybridization i wanted to mix together two kinds of cells one that could divide and one that couldn't divide and immortalize the one the t lymphocyte that couldn't divide and that project went well but the more i learned about the hey flick hypothesis and all of that self-senescence stuff the more convinced i was that it wasn't going to teach me anything i i wanted to learn about aging and so i decided as a postdoc to become an immunologist the lab i worked at at harvard was an immunology lab and the one at sloan kettering was an immunology lab too then when i set up my own lab at boston university it was principally to study immunology and how aging modified the immune system when i came to michigan in 1990 i was still mostly an immunologist focusing on aging and writing book chapters on how aging modified immunity and and the like over the next decade or so i switched gradually into focusing on aging more broadly with immunology becoming only a minor interest and now we do very little immunology it's nearly all the kind of work that is focused on what is controlling the aging process and how you can use that to develop interventions give folks a little bit of the history around hayflick and the division of cells and some of these observations these are kind of the some of the foundational things in in aging right unfortunately yes i don't know how whether you want the two minute or the 20 minute or the three hour rant about this but the phenomenon that hayflick more or less discovered was that if you take normal human cells which are not cancer cells and you let them grow in tissue culture they're divide but only a limited number of times about 50 times and then they stop and if you listen to hay flick he then decided that was sort of like aging he had sort of found a way to study aging in culture now that's nuts it's nothing like aging in the slightest but he thought it might be like aging so at that time people were really excited by tissue culture it was the brand new thing everybody wanted to work on tissue culture and it seemed like a wonderful exciting opportunity to be able to use tissue culture to study aging so they bought this idea and a whole generation of superb cell biologists spent their life investigating the hayflick system under the illusion that they were studying aging parenthetically i about 15 or 20 years later when i was just beginning to become well known i was invited to give a talk at new york university whose chair of pathology was vittorio defending and defending had been a colleague of hayflick when hayflick was making these discoveries and defend he told me that he and hayflick had had lunch over and over again and hayflick had been a kind of a grump and had said over and over again oh my cells they just won't grow oh i tried them i thought them out only two weeks ago and they already stopped growing and defending to if you believe his story which i do told hey flip well ha ha len maybe they're just getting old and hey flick who whose sense of humor is notoriously absent did not understand he was being joshed he thought it was a hypothesis a scientific hypothesis and after a while he persuaded himself that it was his hypothesis and then that it was the correct hypothesis so he's a persuasive fellow and many people bought into the notion that the idea that when cells stop growing in culture it's sort of like or caused by or something related to aging too many people in my view accepted that as the truth of the matter and then when it later became established that the limitation of growth the hayflick limit was actually due to shortening of telomeres a very important finding and certainly true people convinced themselves because they thought it was like aging the telomeres were something to do with aging too and it was that way in which a whole new generation of people sort of bought into the hayflick and the telomeres thing as a central cause of the aging process despite all the evidence to the contrary well it's interesting you bring this up of course because at least at the time that we sit here recording this it's only been about a week since a story came out of israel which i'm sure you've been emailed about as many times as i have you haven't okay well consider yourself lucky because i've only been emailed it about 57 times which is apparently the most rigorous study in the history of humans demonstrating the anti-aging benefits of hyperbaric oxygen so you see rich in this amazing study done in israel a group of volunteers were exposed to hyperbaric oxygen and wouldn't you know it their telomeres lengthened a bit and so as a result of that i've had i don't know i'd probably need scientific notation to count the number of people that have emailed me that story to tell me why are we not doing hyperbaric oxygen you see this is the fountain of youth and i think i forwarded it to joan manick and matt caberline because the three of us have a grumpy old men women club where we've grown on about the idea of until you have really good biomarkers for aging it's really hard to study aging and we can't use telomere length as a biomarker of aging but nobody really wants to listen to that i agree with all three of you yeah and you know it's funny it's entirely possible that hyperbaric oxygen could well have health benefits under certain circumstances certainly i'm not endorsing it there's no evidence that that statement is true but it's not silly there are certainly oxygen sensing circuits in multiple cells which at least in worms can trigger anti-aging programs pro longevity programs so it's not a dumb idea and there's some really good labs pursuing it the weakness i haven't read the paper but from what you've told me the weakness is just the one you've cited aging and telomere length are not the same thing and if you want to prove that hyperbaric conditions not suitable doses and it's suitable time intervals etc might be good for you that's a very plausible idea well worth testing it's just that you don't test it by measuring telomeres yeah i mean it's interesting obviously i think that the telomere i don't want to say story i would say the telomere concept or or notion as a biomarker even though it's not really a biomarker i think gets a lot of credibility based on the fact that a nobel prize was awarded for its elucidation so it's interesting i've heard people say look and i think this is the most accurate thing i've heard stated which is look the work that blackburn did is really amazing biology and it's worthy of a nobel prize but it doesn't really explain aging and those two statements can co-exist oh sure and but you've left out a third important statement telomere biology is a critical element in cancer biology and the amazing work that several people including blackburn did to work out the telomere story is i think really a fundamental advance in our understanding of cancer in people and it may also have an interesting side light in evolutionary biology there are some species mice for instance with extremely long telomeres that if they need an ant they don't need much anti-cancer defense at all they're going to get eaten in six months vera gorbunava at rochester has done some lovely work on the ways in which different species with different body size and different life spans differ in their ways of stopping the cancer process some relying like people do on the telomere alarm clock where the tillers get too short that this puts a whole lot of anti-cancer defenses into play and others like mice where this does not happen the mice have very long telomeres they don't need telomeres to tell them when their cells are getting cancerous as a fundamental step in our understanding of cancer biology in people and the way in which anti-cancer defenses evolve it's great stuff it's just the notion that it's sort of a shortcut for actually working on aging in my view does not hold up very well yeah well i think i couldn't agree with you more and it's certainly on the short list of frustrations i have in this space where people very quickly revert to well but look but intervention x shortened tel or you know length and telomeres therefore it's somehow a cure for longevity and or a cure for aging and despite all evidence of the contrary so what what prompted the move from bu to michigan in 1990 my wife got a job as a professor of english at the university of michigan and she said would you like to move with me to michigan why don't you look for a job so that worked out pretty well i mean i'm being a little coy i had always wanted to move to michigan michigan was very strong university and very strong in aging research and i had said to her you know she was coming up for tenure at harvard harvard had never tenured a woman in 372 years in english they had never found a competent woman who could be an english professor so we know they were not going to start with patsy and i said hey why don't you apply to michigan i love to move to michigan and it worked out for both of us excellent so what is it that brought to your mind this idea of the itp this is partly your brainchild right i was the midwife or something so the national aging institute in its division of aging biology at that time was headed by a visionary guy named huber warner and hubert thought it would be a great idea for the aging research community generally to have a program in which drugs were tried on mice or mice and worms or mice worms and flies and dogs or something so he commissioned a committee of eight or ten or twelve of us to sit down with him and nancy nadan who was his deputy at the time and we spent a day or two talking about what the nia might do to develop a program in which interventions potential interventions were tested directly and after the first night i went into a room with arlen richardson who at the time was at texas and is now at oklahoma and arlen and i put together what we viewed would be the best way to do this focusing on mice and we sold it to huber so huber then asked me to write down a more formal plan which he and i wrote up as an article for mechanisms and aging and development and when it was time for the nia to formulate the rules for the program and to start saying would you please everybody apply for this program we have some money the program that arlen and i had sketched out in which hubert helped to refine and it by then been through three or four versions became the sort of foundation on which the program was developed and then three grants were awarded my own david harrison's at the jackson labs and randy strong at texas so the three of us it took us a while to sort of get to the point where we all agreed as to what should be done and how it should be done but the foundation of the program is one that huber endorsing which which arlen and i had helped to develop by now it's about 18 years ago this is around the time you wrote a paper extending life scientific prospects and political obstacles right that that paper coincides almost with when you and strong and harrison kind of came up with what the principles of the itp would be right yes that i mean the two events were not really related in any cause and effect fashion but it's about the same time i had been asked to give a talk at the law school at the university of michigan they were putting a seminar together an all-day symposium in the end of life and the other people chatting one was how to take care of old people one was how to make decisions triage decisions at the end of life and i was the only biologist on the program so i gave them the talk which then became that article in the middle bank quarterly that you've been mentioning now you make three big points in this article that i think are worth spending a minute on before we jump into the itp because it i think it really sets an adequate stage right so again keeping in mind this is an article written about 18 years ago and it's important i think for people to realize that the world we live in today is much more open to the discussion we're going to have than it was i think 20 years ago that's for sure so you said look discussions of anti-aging medicine aren't silly the development of an anti-aging strategy is starting to make headway and further work here would be worthwhile that was basically the thesis of your paper yes i agree and it's i think a really important point that deserves stress it's still an evolving process we're not there yet but 18 years ago we we certainly weren't even close to there around that time the gordon research conference on aging which is an invitation only conference about 120 more or less distinguished researchers i got into a fight with my friend george martin as to whether aging could be considered a single process a drug might slow that process down or whether it was a very complex spaghetti bowl filled with 30 or 40 or 50 different processes each one of which had its own independent control and george and i did not agree about that so as a game he asked the assembled conferees to vote and you could vote zero to ten zero if you agree that there were too many processes ever to be controlled together and ten if you happen to take my position the average score was about two or three very few people at that time even among the sophisticated best educated professional aging researchers would check the box that said yeah there's a single aging process and until you check that box the notion that you could interrupt the process makes no sense because if there is no process then interrupting it is a hopeless goal i think you really sort of need to see it as a unitary process in order to devote much time to trying to slow that process down it's confusing because there are dozens and hundreds of things that go wrong in old age and learning about any one of them can be very productive it's just that in addition to looking at any one of them individually the one that leads to cataracts the one that leads to muscle failure etc the concept that there's some underlying mechanism that speeds them up a lot in mice or a little bit in horses or slows them down a lot in people or an awful lot in wales once you get that idea in your head then suddenly it becomes permissible to think about ways to slow it down now there were a couple of things that we already quote unquote knew at this time that had to give you some hope obviously there was the vast literature on caloric restriction so almost without exception and there are some very notable exceptions but almost without exception some form of caloric restriction and we could get into all the details of different species and when it's applied during life and to what extent and wild types versus not but there was clearly a path towards extending life with caloric restriction and then of course we had the daf mutants in c elegans cynthia kenyon's work which i think was probably early 90s right that was 1993 1993. and if i recall her first god it's been a while since i've looked at this her first observation was with was it daft 16 was the first one or was it the first paper the critical paper made two big discoveries one was the mutants of death to extended lifespan and that mutants of daf-16 blocked when combined yeah and now you could combine with cr and then get a better outcome but yes and daf ii ended up being the analog of the igf receptor and i think daf 16 was basically an analog of fox03a or 3b i can't recall yeah it wasn't quite the receptor it was the thing that the receptor turned on but it's one one step downstream one step downstream inside yeah so explain to folks why that was relevant as a proof of principle at least well first of all it's just the point you were making those of us who knew the caloric restriction literature were screaming our heads off saying see look you can slow the whole thing down and no one quite bought into that cynthia demonstration which was also you know uh pioneered by other people like tom johnson and gary rufkin and some others at the same time pointed out that a single gene mutation could extend longevity dramatically in a worm the funny thing is you know nature early in 1993 published a very early date detailed six-page paper by linda partridge and her colleagues proving that there could never be a single gene mutation that extended life lifespan aging was too complicated too many feedback circuits it could never ever be done and linda's paper was based was was a statement of any species it wasn't explicitly stated but it was a theoretical proof that you could never have a single gene mutating that extended lifespan absolute mathematical proof lots of equations i could couldn't follow that it can't follow now so about six months later cynthia's paper came out saying hey look here's a gene that does that so that same issue linda was asked to comment on linda partridge and she wrote a paper saying well of course c elegans is different c elegans has dour mutants they're very very special but there could never ever be in any other species a gene that does this trust me on that so it took three more years for the the the second shoe to drop so to speak which is andre barkey's paper with holly brownborg and two other colleagues showing that the ames dwarf mutation could extend lifespan by about 40 percent in a mouse once it was true for mice and truth for worms the idea that you know there might be something to this became defensible one of my favorite conference stories about a year or two after the ames dwarf paper came out also in nature i was at a conference and robin holliday an australian scientist who who was very well respected gave a keynote lecture explaining why you could never have a gene that it slowed the aging process and extended longevity and i raised my hand to say but you know there are two papers here one in worms one in mice saying that there are single g mutations that extend longevity and that's uh not compatible with your theory and he said yeah but there could never be a single gene mutation that could extend longevity and so we went through that loop about twice and then i went out to get a cup of coffee it's an ocean a zombie notion that sort of was hard to kill and many scientists still are distinctly uncomfortable with the notion not all of them anymore i think our team is winning but many people still are reluctant even if they're sophisticated and know the literature to accept the general principle that there are aging processes which can be slowed down if you consider them as as a unitary group of changes with a common controlling factor and i always think that part of the debate is fixating on the wrong point right i mean whether or not it's a single gene or multiple genes is probably less the point the bigger point at least for me as an outsider is aging malleable yes or no to me that's the question that matters and if prior to the 1990s if the answer was believed no aging is not malleable it is what it is then it's a very uninteresting field to be in yeah no i agree with that i think you're right on point here i would add one more phillip to that the question everybody was asking and which i used to think was pertinent is what causes aging what is the cause of aging and now i don't think that anymore i think the real question that we're all trying to answer or ought to be trying to answer is what is it that can slow aging my own current sort of philosophical framework is that aging is caused by an awful lot of different things some cells die some cells become mutant some tissue structures get cross-linked or heavy metals accumulate in a key cell all of those are really bad for you and as they accumulate and accumulate and accumulate you start to feel older and then more diseased but the key point i think is that there are biological processes that can postpone all of that stuff together that can postpone it for five decades and people or almost a year in a mouse or 25 years in a chimp so i don't really care what causes aging what i care about is what is the process that can postpone all the different aspects of aging i think once you rephrase the question in that way you're well on the way towards designing experimental paradigms to address the serious question which is the coordination and eventually the postponement of these multiple aspects of the aging process i think it's worth restating that rich because that might be one of the most important teaching points i think for anybody who thinks about science and certainly my mentor in the lab i also studied immunology would constantly make this point which is if you don't ask the right question you are guaranteed to flail you know you might get lucky but you're you're gonna flail now if you ask the right question you you may still fail but you you really you know it's the difference between starting on your own 20-yard line and the other guy's 20-yard line yeah i agree i and i agree it's a really critical point a lot of the time at like an aging meeting somebody usually someone fairly new to the field will say oh well you don't understand what aging is let me explain to you what aging is and everybody who's heard this line of argument 40 or 50 or 60 times will sigh sometimes we'll go out and get another cup of coffee and say well let's talk about that at the break or at the bar after the meeting but they're wrong the answer is you have to think about it just as you were saying you have to think about these fundamental issues what is the best way to frame this question and it can be tricky if the world is filled with people including myself who are convinced we're right that you're surrounded by people who aren't right they're wrong but they're convinced they're right and sort of talking them into viewing the matter from another framework takes a while let's dive into the itp the interventions testing program this amazing amazing scientific framework think of it as a program i don't know how do you describe it to people i sort of think of it as a gold standard by which we test single drug often but sometimes not just single drug interventions in a robust rigorous manner and when things pass the itp test we take them really seriously when things fail in an itp even if they've succeeded elsewhere we look at them very closely you know so so what's the word you would use to describe the itp to somebody on the outside well i agree with most of what you've said and i'm certainly very flattered to hear you describe it in that way although i think you're being a little too optimistic and a little kind so let me let me sort of back go back over what you said the goal of the itp when we've tried our best to meet this goal is to develop a fundamentally sound way of testing one question does this drug extend mouse lifespan and we do our best by designing the program in ways so that our answers will be reliable and to the best we can reproducible and believable for example we use an awful lot of mice because that gives us a lot of statistical power we want to be sure that we will have enough mice present that if a particular drug extends life span by eight or ten percent will pick it up almost all the time eighty percent and ninety percent of the time that's a sort of an ambitious thing to do to give you an example jl shansky and bruce carnes and their colleagues demonstrated years ago that if you abolish cancer in people nobody ever gets cancer again human lifespan goes up by only three percent so the drugs that we are interested in by by designing our program are drugs that are designed to win at our program you've got to be at least three times better than a complete conquest of cancer i'd like to come back to jay's methodology on that because i've never fully understood that calculation because i know he's also made the claim that if you completely abolish atherosclerosis it's about a three percent bump and if it's cancer and atherosclerosis it's like a seven percent bump yeah that's right and if you got rid of cancer heart disease stroke and diabetes it's about an 18 bump so we'll revisit that but let's go back to these principles because there really are four remarkable principles of the itp and that's what it is that for me personally gets me excited so you alluded to one already which is from a statistical standpoint you power to 80 percent for an 8 to 10 detection rate and to put that in english it means you need an awful lot of animals yes each year each of the three sites will have 50 males and 50 females on each drug and also 100 male controls and 100 female controls we we double the number of controls because it gives us a lot better statistical power at relatively little cost then we pull all all the data from all three sites together for our analysis and then you've alluded to now the second feature of the itp which is they are run in parallel at three sites so the miller lab is doing this at michigan the strong lab is doing this in san antonio at ut and harrison is doing this at jackson labs correct yeah that's right okay the next point that makes this pretty special is you are using genetically heterogeneous mice these are not homogeneous so explain to folks why using these genetically heterogeneous mice is an important feature of the itps yeah i will let me just say one more point about that second point you raised doing it at all three sites not only gives us power but it also tells us we're getting an effect that is reproducible at three sites if for instance and we've certainly seen this we get a drug that does just terrific at one of the sites but not at all if the other two something may have gone wrong that's right that's a methodological issue right there potentially yeah if you get a drug that works pretty darn well at all three sites people have very good reason for believing it could work at their site too that sort of instantaneous reproducibility is a major reason for doing it at three sites the literature is filled with reports of a drug that did something good to a mouse at one site and then no one wants to wait four years to test it out doing three tests at the same time gets us around that then the question you asked is why use the genetically heterogeneous mice about 90 percent of the work in aging with mice and actually of medical research with mice uses a single inbred genotype where every mouse is the same there's no variation from mouse to mouse in their genetics and in addition it's in bread and everybody knows if you have a choice you'd rather not be inbred that's why we don't allow people to get married to their brothers and sisters because it tends to produce weak offspring and every one of the inbred strains has its own set of bizarre peculiarities many of them are blind by the time they're grown ups most of them are deaf etc etc so what we wanted to do in developing a genetically heterogeneous stock was avoid that we did not want to trick ourselves into picking a drug that only worked on black six mice and conversely we did not want to miss a really good drug that just happened not to work on black six mice so what we do is we obtain from the jackson laboratories to different kinds of mice which have represent four different grandparents inbred grandparents when we cross them together just like when your mother and father produce offspring each one of those children is genetically unique but each one will share half of its genes with all the others at random a random half so all of the mice we've produced for the idp of which there are now more than twenty thousand have that in common no two mice are ever the same but any two mice share half their genes the other advantage of doing it this way is that the jackson labs sort of the gold standard in inbred stocks they're black six this year and there are black six ten years from now and their black six ten years ago are as close to the identical as as science can guarantee and what that means is that the four-way cross mice we use the het3 mice are the same year after year after year we can make a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand of them with the same characteristics anyone else anywhere in the world that wants to make them can do so very inexpensively and be sure that their population characteristics the average numbers of mice that have this gene or this pair of genes or this triplet of genes will be the same as the ones that we are using it gives a sort of reproducible heterogeneity which i wish almost everyone would adopt i think that's the way to do science and people who are at the origins of the idp agreed with me about that so that's why the itp does it that way do you have a sense of what fraction of research is done in mice utilizing genetically heterogeneous mice in the fashion you describe are we talking less than 10 oh yeah much less than 10 and the reason is that when people want to work in aging they call the nia the national aging institute and they say can i please have some old mice and the nia does not have genetically heterogeneous mice they had them for i begged and pleaded and kicked and screamed as did some colleagues and they set up a colony of genetically heterogeneous mice and after three or four years they were not receiving many requests everybody was saying i want black six mice my scientific parents use black six mice and everybody always uses black six mice i need black six mice so the nia for lack of demand folded up the colony and now that i think largely because the itp people are beginning to realize the folly of using black six mice and the good reasons for using genetically heterogeneous mice and the nia keeps getting a sprinkling of phone calls every now and then saying please please can you carry these genetically heterogeneous mice but it's momentum they have contracts with their mouse producers and it would take at least richard hodus the director of the nia had two or three or four of his trusted associates to say oh yeah we should do that and so far they haven't all right so there's one more feature of the itp which is that basically anybody can make a suggestion for a molecule right yeah so what was the first candidate molecule in terms of the first pool that was suggested i don't know i have to go back and check my notes and the reason i'm a little foggy on this is that actually we had a sort of a proto embryonic itp at the university of michigan only a single site for about two years at that time we had a nathan shock center funded by nia and i devoted my chunk of the nation jacques center to testing four or five or six drugs over a period of two years none of them worked and then the itp got formally funded it became a multi-institutional program that first year there were four suggestions that we accepted one of them was aspirin one of them was a molecule called ndga which is nor dihydro guyaretic acid which actually does work it's worked three times in a row although it works only in males one of them was nitroflorboprofen and i forgot the fourth i'd have to check my notes but those were the first four that were accepted for the initial round of the itp now aspirin's interesting because it initially showed that it worked in males but this is one of the examples of something that didn't replicate after the itp is that correct yeah it was not actually a formal attempt at replication the initial dose of aspirin was very low that is 1 100th of the dose a person would take even if adjusted for mouse body weight and it gave only an sort of an 8 or 10 increase and it was in males only why the decision to use such a low dose the sponsor that is the person who says please use this drug we take his or her suggestion very seriously and the sponsor of this was a guy named christian van lielenberg who's now at the university of florida and he gave a strong rationale for why he thought this dose was appropriate and we accepted his suggestion and it seemed to be a fairly good suggestion in the sense that it worked but then several years later we said maybe it would have worked even better if we'd used a higher dose maybe it would have worked even better maybe even in females if we used a dose that approximates the sort of 83 milligrams a day thing that i used to take to prevent heart attacks that a lot of people take to prevent heart attacks so we tried it at two doses higher than the one we had originally evaluated and it did not extend longevity so what you know it was not an exact replication it was a replication at higher dose it succeeded the first time sort of it did not succeed the second time and by that point we had enough things that really worked great that we weren't about to devote additional time and energy to trying intermediate doses or something like that to give you a sense of the budgetary commitment the total program budget each year in direct costs is about a million bucks so if we test six drugs a year something like that three million dollars divided by six about a half a million buck investment for each drug accepted for an initial test into the program crudely speaking so we have enough money now because the nia has been extremely generous to us that we can test five or six or seven drugs each year for the first time and also go back and recheck one or two of these a year but we can't go much above that without running out of money so if we were to decide to try aspirin at a few more doses we'd be eliminating from our program some other drugs that have never been tested but look really promising so we make that decision each year as a group with with the help of five other scientists who are not part of the itp but give us advice on what drugs to pick is part of your decision to include a drug or not include a drug at all based on clinical data in humans oh yeah sure i mean we know that mice are not humans and the things that work in mice might not work in humans and vice versa but if someone says see this drug shows potential for helping to solve prevent cancer in humans or to prevent some aspects of neurological decline in humans that's very strong argument as to why it might well be worth testing in mice testing a drug in humans with lifespan as an endpoint is almost hopelessly slow and almost hopelessly expensive the ideal animal for making a test of that is the mouse so whenever we have a suggestion we consider a wide range of different kinds of evidence and clinical evidence about a health effect in people can be given a very high weight in addition even if a drug is used in humans for something that's not in arguably unrelated to the aging process the fact that it's fda approved also is a big selling point because if one of our drugs works in mice and it's already fda approved then the barriers towards evaluating it in human clinical situations become much easier to get over because of the safety tests that have already gone into obtaining fda approval for some other indication like metformin for instance yeah we'll come to metformin because there's a few drugs on the itp hit list i want to really spend some time on metformin is one of them of course rapamycin another but i'm curious like using aspirin as an example if if you were today going to study aspirin for the first time would you be swayed by the fact that the evidence for use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease is quite weak or would you chalk that up to hey maybe for that indication it is but nobody's really evaluated all-cause mortality over a long enough period of time in humans we think it's still worth studying you're thinking about this in a very good sophisticated way you could join our compound review committee so all of these points can and do come up in the discussion of which drugs to give highest priority to the fact that something might or might not modulate longevity or i'll cause mortality in people is worth knowing but there are lots of things that test interesting ideas in mice that may not be of primary relevance in in the human clinical setting aspirin for instance is a famous anti-inflammatory and there are lots of good reasons which i'm sure you know suggests that inflammation as may go up as you get older and it's probably bad for you and may contribute to lots of diseases so it's a very strong argument for saying let's test some anti-inflammatory drugs in the mice we're not testing aspirin in mice to prevent heart attacks mice don't get heart attacks but the notion that it's a strong anti-inflammatory and that the processes of inflammation contribute to aging in both species that makes some sense and that's a good reason to test it yeah let's move to your second cohort here because this is where you sort of hit one out of the park right so in cohort 2 in 2005 started in 2005 rapamycin is one of the candidate drugs who brought that to the committee dave sharp dave sharp was a colleague of randy strong's at texas he's an expert on tor the target of rapamycin he was aware of invertebrate data in worms and in flies saying that if you had a mutant that inhibited the function of the enzyme that led to longevity increases in these two invertebrate species and so he said look i've got a drug that can inhibit the enzyme why don't you give the drug device rapamycin is that drug and it's actually safe enough that you can use it in certain high-risk situations in people so dave sharp suggested it and we tried it randy strong noticed first of all that when you gave it to mice in the usual form 90 95 percent of it was eaten up in the stomach so randy and dave and their collaborators then spent a year trying to successfully trying to reformulate the rapamycin by coating it in a kind of a shell that would get it through the stomach into the small intestine where it would be absorbed that's why for the first time around instead of starting at four months which was our goal we could only start at 19 months of age or 20 months of age it took us that long took randy that long to get the drug into a form which was effective when given by mouth but yes then that was the first drug that gave a very strong signal in both males and females and it's still the only drug that we've tested so far which gives a very strong signal in females we have two others that work repeatedly in females but they're not as strong in terms of the size of the effect as rapamycin in females the other thing that's really noteworthy about this is what you just alluded to which is based on the need to reformulate rapamycin to improve its bioavailability you without planning it this way effectively we're giving rapamycin to 60 year old mice yup 20 month old mice which are sort of roughly the equivalent of a 60 year old person so this is actually very interesting because the gold standard intervention for treating mice which is caloric restriction typically only works when initiated earlier in life and so typically when you wait until a mouse is two years old to begin calorically restricting it it's too little too late that's right richard weinrich found that it works great if and restriction works great at sort of four or five months of age 12 to 14 months of age it still works but not so great and then weindra found that if you started as late as 19 or 20 months in his hand it failed just as you were saying so how do you put the rapamycin finding in so one way that you know you can think about this i guess is to think of it as here's a 50 year old person how many years do they have left in life right and if you do nothing we would say the average 50 year old person has 30 years left yes is that about the right number if she's a white woman yes and a man wouldn't be too far off from that right five years less but yes that's right that's okay that's generally correct so what did the rapamycin data suggest if they were to translate to humans which is a big if the point you're making is exactly on point i bet that it was a waste of time and money to give rabomycin to 20 month old mice to middle-aged mice i said this can't possibly work look caloric restriction doesn't work at this age just as you're saying and so it's a waste of time and somebody said yeah but we've already got the mice we've already paid for them let's try it they were right of course and i was completely wrong and that's a big surprise that i think is the reason why the paper was attractive enough to be published in nature the notion is and here this becomes hand waving because we don't have a molecular explanation but the notion is that there are some processes really bad for you when you're a 20 month old mouse or 60 65 year old person that are still not irreversible that can be reversed and that that reversing can be dependent upon inhibition of tor signals so giving rapamycin to a 20 month old mouse extends longevity dramatically just as dramatically as if you had started the rapamycin at a much younger age that's a fundamental i think reformulation of how we thought aging worked and independent of the notion that see you can take a drug and it can make you live a long time the observation that some though not all of our drugs that work for us are fully effective when started late in life suggests two things one is the theoretical thing some things are going on late in life which are still reversible and and have a major effect on your health and secondly of course if you if you have any friends who are 50 and 60 and 70 year old and they would like to take a drug that makes them live longer that's fairly good news so let's explain a slight semantic point that's going to be interesting or i guess relevant as we kind of go through these things can you explain to folks the difference between increasing median survival and maximum survival like how do you think about it what moves the needle for you when you're thinking about something yeah i mean just technically median survival is the age at which half of them have died and half of them haven't died yet okay maximum survival is a folk notion it's it's basically how long is the oldest mouse or person who's ever lived and that's a value with very limited statistical appeal because the oldest person in a group of 100 people is not going to live as long as the oldest person in a group of a million people or 100 million people or 10 billion people so the the statistic that is probably intuitive and a best substitute for that is what is the age at which 90 of the people have lived that we crudely refer to that as maximum lifespan though it's really not maximum lifespan the reason it's an important concept in terms of understanding how to interpret survival statistics and survival curves is that if you happen to have let's say a group of animals many of which are dying let's talk about in terms of human years most of them are dying in their 30s and 40s and 50s or something and you have something that extends their median lifespan up to 60. you can see as a public health benefit that's why a lot of people get immunized and don't want to have their kids smoke etc but it hasn't worked on the aging process it hasn't in particular had any real effect on how much longer you're going to live when you're 70. but if you had a drug or a diet or some intervention that authentically slowed the aging process then it would extend expectancy of of additional healthy years of life even for those who are already quite old in their 50s 60s 70s and 80s and that will modify the age of death at the 90th percentile so drugs that only extend the median and don't affect the age of death of the longest live 5 or 10 percent they might be interesting in some ways but they are considered less plausible as candidates for anti-aging drugs if you have a drug that's authentically slowing aging one of the things you most want to see is that the very oldest animals in this drug-treated group are living longer than the very oldest animals in the untreated control group and so when you look at the rapamycin data they were very interesting the median extension which we've already said not as interesting that's just saying what's the age at which half the animals have died and the males went up 20 percent and the females that went up 13 these are huge numbers i think you may have the numbers backwards in the females the median goes up more than in the males oh i thought that was for i thought that was for the 90th percentile it went out more in the females well for both of them it's a technical okay artifact because when you give the same dose of rapamycin in chow the blood levels in the females are three times higher than the males so we don't know why i'd like to come back to that in a second the numbers i've always remembered are actually not the median ones i could be out to lunch on those the ones i've have ingrained in my head and maybe i hope i have them right is the the p90 life lifespan extension which in males was nine percent in females was 14 do those sound right to you i'd have to look it up but that sounds plausible yep directionally that's a big deal because that's total lifespan isn't it that's not incremental above the point you got it we don't cheat we don't calculate incremental life all right so let's explain to people what that means because these are huge numbers so explain to people why that basically translates to 25 more life once you've reached midlife versus 9 or 14 more life this is a subtle way of doing the math more rigorously yeah the editors of nature insisted that we do that calculation that is the number of additional years or months of life after you give the drug they they thought that would sex up the paper and kicking and screaming we put it into the paper but it's not i think terribly informative there's an easy to imagine thought experiment you've got someone on a ventilator he or she is on death's doorstep they're gonna die today and you leave them on the ventilator for one more day and then you give up and they die so you've extended you've doubled their lifespan right you've gone from one day to two days that's a hundred percent increase in lifespan so when i put it that way you can see that that's not a very useful statistic to calculate if for if your insurance agent it's nice to know at the time you sell the insurance policy what the life extension will be from the time the person buys the insurance policy but in terms of biology and pathobiology and being able to compare lab a to lab b drug a to drug b i think keeping it on the level of what is the change in the overall median is important there's one exception to that and that's the fairly obvious one if you start a drug really really late you know if you start a drug at an age when 35 or 40 of the animals have already died you're asking a lot of that drug to extend the median lifespan so if you start rabomycin at 19 or 20 months of age in males at 20 months of age 15 or 20 of the mice have already died depending on what site you're talking about so if you get any extension of the median lifespan it sort of had to start working immediately nobody could die for the next few months that's the situation where the statistics on how how many of them make it to the 90th percentile become more informative than a percentage change in median and to my eye rapamycin is the only drug you've started at 20 months i know you repeated it once at 20 but that's that's a big ask of a drug right well i'm pleased that it worked but it's not the only drug that works well i'm saying starting at 20 months of life i know and that's what i'm talking about yeah we've used a carbos starting at 20 months of age you did okay i thought carbo started earlier okay yes you're right the initial paper was a carbos at four or five months yeah but then we repeated it and that's published too where we started a carbos at i believe 20 months of age and it worked half as well as a carbo started in youth that is we got a statistically significant change in the maximum lifespan by our statistical procedure in both sexes and a statistically significant change in the males even in the median life span in the females the p-value for median was .07 if memory serves so a carbos started in late middle age is effective in both sexes not as effective as if you start it in youth and by the time this podcast airs our paper on 17 hour faster dial late start will have appeared and 17 alpha estradiol which only works in males the new paper just now at the last stages of revision show that if you started at 16 months of age in males it's just as good as if you start it at an earlier age even if you started as late as 20 months of age it works great just as much it's not statistically distinguishable from the 16-month start so that means of the drugs that we've tested for late start rapamycin works perfectly a carbos works about half half as well as an early start and 17 alpha ester dial seems to work just as well in late middle age a former student of mine now an independent researcher named mike garrett together with his colleagues charlene day and john herrera have already published a paper using these same mice treated with 17 alpha estradiol where they started at 16 months or 20 months of age and they found that the muscles got stronger their glucose tolerance got better muscle structure changed for the better so they published that before we could publish our life span data but it's quite consistent even late start for 17 alpha estradiol seems to have highly beneficial effects uh just as good and in some cases even a little better than if you start in earlier ages now i definitely want to spend some time on acarbose and 17 alpha estradiol along with a few others but i want to go back to something in rapamycin so we've talked about the the first experiment tell me about the dosing was the dosing done daily for rapamycin yes in that first experiment sure it's in the food they eat all they want every single day so this is interesting right because what we've learned about rapamycin since that time is it inhibits two complexes of tor complex one and complex two now today we believe most of the longevity benefits of rapamycin come from the inhibition of complex one not complex ii and furthermore we believe that some of the negative consequences of constitutive use of rapamycin come from its uh inhibition of complex two and so when you look at some of the more recent human data using wrapalogs such as everolimus they seem to favor an intermittent strategy so dosing rapamycin say weakly which is enough to inhibit if you give a big enough dose it's enough to inhibit complex one but not enough to inhibit complex two and then by the time you come back to redose you're in this situation of you're just knocking down one but never two so of course i've always found it just interesting that the study even worked with daily dosing of rapamycin what are your thoughts on that you raised five or six or seven or eight really interesting points there so let's let's go back and do the one at a time rapamycin does not directly inhibit mtor complex 2. what it does is it leads to feedback circuits which destabilize enter complex 2 and eventually cause it to be degraded so the subtleties of the kinetics of when to start it when to start it when to get one so that's and it may well differ from cell type to cell type so those are things that pharmacologists need to work out carefully the second thing to point out is that a guy in my lab gonzalo garcia has very carefully looked at torque complex one and torque complex ii activity for the last three or four years in not in these drug-treated mice but in mutant mice that have one of two mutations the snell dwarf mutation and the growth hormone receptor knockout mutation that extend longevity by 30 percent and gonzalo found something very interesting both of those mutations move toward complex one down that's good but they move toward complex two up in the opposite direction so this raises the possibility that is actually the elevation of tor complex ii in these mutant mice it's good for them and gonzalo has found several examples of mice where there's a mutation that blocks the mtar complex ii elevation they do not live a long time so most recently and this is a paper that's just submitted it's not published yet gonzalo has taken these drug-treated mice rapamycin or a carbos or 17 alpha ester diol and look to see what's happening there with mtor complex 1 and mtar complex 2. there are changes with rapamycin both males and females there are changes with a carbos both males and females and their changes with 17 alpha estradiol but it's the males only and that's really cool because it's the males only that get a life span benefit from 17 alphestra dial so to summarize all of that is going to be really complicated the basic idea that knocking down to our complex one might be a good thing and that knocking down tor complex two might be a bad thing that was the premise of your question i think that's a good initial sound foundation for further work but the interactions between them the ways in which different cell types may have different responses it's going to be much more complicated than that the last complication i'll point out is that gonzalo has also found that mtr complex ii has four different substrates that was widely known before he began this work what he found is that the good stuff turns on three of these targets for mtor complex two and turns the other one off so it's really if if he's right it's really a change not so much in the amount of tor complex 2 but in its target specificity which particular substrates it modifies and which ones it stops modifying that's a subtlety that may be the whole story there as to why changes in mtar complex 2 should be a part of any sophisticated study of this drug and other drugs when you repeated the rapamycin study one year later in cohort three obviously having worked out the delivery system the average age at treatment was now nine months instead of 12 months and obviously this was interesting because 9 instead of 20 you mean sorry sorry 9 instead of 20. so now this is interesting in that a you're going to repeat a very important finding and two you're going to see if the age effect was significant and it's kind of remarkable both groups got a little bit better which i guess you would expect but it's worth noting you still see these remarkable effects right you saw a lower median extension because of the point that you mentioned earlier but the maximum extension in males went from 9 to 11 percent and in females it went from 14 to 16 so again females had an advantage with rapamycin but both of these numbers are really quite impressive i mean these are pretty significant increases in in lifespan and you're now you know functionally starting this in people in their you know early 30s basically yeah so there are two things to say one is that the curves for the early start nine months or late start 20 months we're compared very carefully by scott pletcher who's a mathematical demographer biodemographer and they're indistinguishable that is there's no statistical difference between the early start mice and the late start mice small difference is like nine percent versus eleven percent or nine percent versus twelve percent there's a lot of variance um from mouse to mouse and group to group you don't want to take minor changes like that with put too much weight on them they're more or less the same thing from the point of view of replicability the other point you made that we referred to a moment ago had to do with the male versus female differences for rapamycin response randy strong and marty javers and their colleagues at the university of texas did a really useful study they gave rapamycin for a short period of time to male and female mice and then took blood samples every i don't know every hour every two hours or something and the rapamycin blood content in the female mice was two or three times higher than it was in the male mice so it was higher and stayed up longer we don't know why rapamycin in the blood of female mice is greatly elevated compared to rapamycin in the blood of male mice but when you're comparing two curves at the same dose in food and the females do a bit longer than the males get a bigger benefit than the males it's hard to know how that comparison would come out if you're actually adjusting them to the same blood level have you seen that with any other drug rich where going into the food same quantity going in you see a 3x difference in plasma level no we haven't looked very carefully i mean we did it for rapamycin because we were so surprised that the females were doing better than the males and it's it's a difficult and expensive study to do i think we should do it for other drugs as well we marty and randy do check the drug concentration as a part of a pilot project of mice given any one of our drugs they they're given the drug for eight weeks of age then marty and randy get blood samples but that gives you just a sort of a steady state dose what if you're eating it every single day for eight weeks what is the blood level the study that was most informative for rapamycin was to take fresh virgin mice and give them the drug at a defined date at a defined amount and then quickly measure the blood levels after that that has to be set up with a separate cohort of mice if you want to be obsessive as you should you have to do it at young mice middle aged mice old mice it becomes kind of involved and it's we don't do it on a routine basis so the next drug i want to talk about well actually let's go to acarbose you brought it up so let's go to that before we get to resveratrol i mean it's amazing like rich we could sit here and talk for the next month and go through every single drug in the itp history because there's not one of these that isn't interesting both in its success and failures obviously we don't have the time for that we're going to in the show notes to this put out a spreadsheet that covers every single result but nevertheless it's just it's just an amazing body of work so let's talk about acarbose now was david allison one of the first people involved in that i know david very well and i know that david's been involved in a number of suggestions around the itps he sponsored some was he originally involved in the acarbose work yeah the a carbos application came in from david allison and a colleague of his daniel smith okay this is an off-the-shelf drug typically used in people with diabetes and it basically blocks the absorption of glucose in the gut more or less well tolerated unless you take too much of it and in which case you know you're going to get some gi distress but it works well i've certainly taken it a number of times i've got bottles of it laying around the house i probably haven't taken it in a couple of years but it you know i used to use it as kind of my cheat meal drug if i wanted to have like a pizza i'd take you know 100 milligrams of a carbos and it would manage to you know prevent my glucose from spiking they should give it away with every pizza i agree that's a good marketing strategy there you go take your acarbose with your carby junk food sprinkle it on the pepperoni now of course what you guys were saying is hey we're not just giving the mice the a carbos with their pizzas they're gonna eat this stuff every day right it's part of the chow yup okay so what was your thinking what was going to happen here well daniel and david said caloric restriction is good for you a carbos is sort of like caloric restriction and it doesn't block glucose absorption but it does block the digestion of starches to sugars and so glucose wouldn't go up so much that would be good for you just like caloric restriction in their view and that was their rationale sorry just to be clear i understand that because there's two different hypotheses that you could be testing here one hypothesis is you will functionally consume or absorb fewer calories and therefore this will be a cr play the other is no the animal will continue to eat you know they'll make up for it with more calories but they will have lower glucose which of those two was the thinking here i don't think daniel and david did a particularly compelling job of discriminating those two ideas the sort of framework for their application which you know i haven't read for what 12 or 13 years now i'd have to go back to see exactly what they argued but they were saying so it's sort of like caloric restriction a little why don't we try it now it's not like as it happens it's not like caloric restriction there are a lot of reasons for saying it's not reproducing caloric restriction but anyway that was the original rationale my current interpretation is that it probably is operating by blocking very highest levels of glucose it in the mice did not lead to a change in the integrated glucose level there's a clinically useful measure which is used in human diabetics too hemoglobin a1c which gives you a measure of over the last few weeks how much average glucose has been in the serum if a person with diabetes takes a carbos that hemoglobin a1c goes down that's one of the ways in which you know it's working in a person now in mice it turns out it doesn't go down we've done this twice now so it's probably not an overall change in the amount of glucose that gets in but a change in the kinetics if i eat five slices of pizza my blood glucose is going to shoot way up and then come down but if i've taken a lot of acarbos first blood glucose will go up it'll just go up slow it won't reach that big peak it'll stay up longer overall but it won't hit the big peak and so currently our guess was mine and the other colleagues was that it was working by blocking the peak glucose and now we think the evidence for that is quite good because of a drug you haven't mentioned yet canagliflozin which was just published a few weeks ago canagliflozin which is also used for diabetes in people also blocks peak glucose in mice and in people and it also extends life span and it also works preferentially in males so it's a reasonable guess that both acarbose and canagliflozin are working by eliminating the huge peak of glucose you get after you eat a meal with a lot of starch in it and of course david also was part of the suggestion team for canna so i know that david and i have spoken at length about sglt2 inhibitors for quite some time and we are absolutely going to get to that so did the mice experience any gi distress in any way that you could assess that none that they complained about [Laughter] they didn't fill out the questionnaire so we don't have any way of detecting how the mice are feeling they didn't stop eating or show obvious signs of distress you know their gi tract and rgi trek are very different we're omnivores grew up as scavengers 200 000 years ago we'll eat almost anything animal or vegetable and mice are evolved to be interested in mostly a grain diet so direct one-to-one comparisons for what our gi tract can handle and theirs may be kind of tricky did those animals both the treatment and the control groups weigh the same no a carbos led to weight loss or a lack of weight gain we don't understand it we see that in some populations but not all in the original itp paper the a carbostreeted mice were lower in weight than the control mice but then my own lab made a whole batch of a carbos treated mice for another purpose and we didn't see a dramatic change in weight and we really don't know why so it's a little bit frustrating and a little bit mysterious and embarrassing we don't always see the same weight change i assume that rapamycin treated and controls did not have a difference in weight it's complicated and it depends on the age at which you start if you start in youth then when the mice are still gaining weight the mice on rapamycin do not gain weight as much as the control mice which does not surprise me because rapamycin stops or slows cell growth and cell division etc if you start in late age like 20 months of age you have a whole series of factors going on mice when they get old they often get sick when they get sick they often lose weight and if rapamycin is extending their lifespan then they're getting sick later so they're not losing weight because they're healthier and those there's several different things going on in old age at 20 months of age where rapamycin in principles would increase some of them decrease some of them it it's harder to interpret whatever you see yeah before we leave a carbos i mean one really important point that i'm sure aware of but i think deserves some emphasis since a carbos is fda approved and has a long safety history hundreds of thousands of people take it particularly in asia and in some parts of europe it's an obvious candidate for a human clinical trial the safety profile is is quite good it's very well documented with many cases having been evaluated for safety so if one was thinking about what drug that works pretty well in mice would be safe for a human clinical trial a carbos has to be on that list i've been arguing with your friend matt my friend too mike gaberline he's giving rapamyces to dogs as you know that's a very important very interesting excellent study and i've been trying desperately to get them to give a carbos to dogs too and we're still not yet having reached a consensus on that point let's come back to this point specifically rich when we get to metformin because to me the metformin a carbo story is a very interesting one as we suss out the difference between very compelling human data and failures in the itp versus successes in the itp absent the out of the ballpark human data and i think that the a carbos metformin story is a great example of that so let's let's park that but let's visit now resveratrol right so for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me i mean i suppose it's because of the relationship between resveratrol and grapes and wine this just was one of those things that caught the world by storm and it's never really gone away right so if i had a dollar for every time i got some stupid google alert telling me to drink more wine because of its anti-aging benefits i'd have a lot of dollars so david sinclair i don't remember the original paper would have been 0.304 ish you probably know this better than i do but that sounds about right yeah so so you know less than 20 years ago basically david's lab at harvard published work showing that when resveratrol was given to metabolically ill mice that were being basically overfed it produced a longevity benefit sort of we can come back and examine that claim in more detail if you wish yeah well let's do that now and then let's talk about how you how it informed your design yeah so the mice in question were being given a diet consisting of 60 coconut oil they were being poisoned the original paper did not mention what they died of they did mention this in a subsequent paper published in cell about two or three years later the mice that were dying because they were on 60 coconut oil were dying because their livers got so big so filled with fat that it compresses the chest cavity and crushes the lungs and the mice cannot breathe that's the cause of death in mice in this particular study that are given a 60 high fat diet so to speak that was used in the original resveratrol paper so understand they're not really studying aging they're studying a bizarre pathological process where the liver gets so fat that it crushes the lungs preventing breathing and then in addition the paper that they published reported median lifespan there was a statistically significant increase in median lifespan but only in the animals that were on this highly toxic diet now it turns out that when you have the whole curve and you look at other indices of maximum lifespan the resveratrol was not a benefit and when you look at the lifespan effects in the mice that were not on this toxic diet there weren't any so paper in nature which was widely misinterpreted over interpreted as a demonstration of a drug that slowed aging was a drug that did not extend maximum lifespan except in mice that were dying of this extremely unusual lipid-specific poisoning so the second part of your question was how did this influence our decision to test resveratrol and the answer this is behind the scenes gossip but it's completely true is that we were ordered to test it richard hodus the director of the national institute in aging was very impressed with resveratrol and like you he was getting i'm sure hundreds or thousands of questions a year request say why don't you guys test resveratrol so resveratrol did not go through our usual screening process this was a directive from the top this was a the only time this has happened we were instructed you will be testing resveratrol and i called david sinclair and said what what does should we use the same dose that you used in your paper and he said no no no that's much too low use at least five times ten times twenty times higher so we followed david's advice and also checked with his close friend and colleague rafa dicabo to get advice on dose so the two doses that we used for resveratrol were i'd have to look it up either three times and ten times higher than in the original sinclair paper maybe it was 10 and 30 times i have to check my notes to get that exactly right but we use both doses both high and then we started at two different ages because we were told to do start some of the mice in youth and others of the mice in middle age and we did that and had no effect on longevity and we were i think the first of three or four groups including sinclair and decabo later on to show that resveratrol given to mice on a normal diet does not extend their lifespan yeah so you in cohort 3 you started at 12 months of age so functionally these are mice in their 30s to 40s and then you had a cohort that started at four months of age you're starting these you know in teenagers no change in median or maximum lifespan although i i believe you had a small statistically significant increase in maximum extension and maximum lifestyle expansion in the late onset resveratrol by three percent does that sound about right i don't think any of them were significant again i'd have i don't want to put my hand in the bible until i've reread the paper but i i think there was no change in any of the statistics it clearly speaks to the point earlier which is in the spirit of looking at this through the lens of studying longevity as opposed to studying protection from a sort of artifactual diet this appeared to be pretty clear what was the response like to that there are people who are who were making a living by selling stuff that was related to resveratrol there was a company actually cirtris that was sold to glaxo for 600 million bucks for pushing sirtuin inhibitors so the reaction from people who had just sold the company was probably i don't care i've got the buddy the reaction from people who sell things in health food stores which are guaranteed to raise your resveratrol levels or they have purple grapes on their cover they were raking in money hand over fists they don't really care who reads papers failing to show it affect advice it's not going to be a problem for their bottom line you know i was always very irritated over and over again pretty good scientists whom i really respected the first slide was a bottle of wine the second slide with some nice grapes the third slide was a picture of resveratrol now by that time they knew that resveratrol was not an important component of wine sinclair had written a beautiful review article showing that if you really want to eat resveratrol it's easy you eat rhubarb rhubarb is where all the resvertrol is at and red wine has got so little that to get the mouse dose of resveratrol you have to drink 600 bottles of wine a day even andre the giant couldn't have done that the beautiful satirical article in the new yorker about what it's like to be a mouse drinking 600 bottles of really good french champagne a day that i said to friends when they asked about resveratrol so i i think eventually there's been a lot of controversy as to whether the sirtuins are important or not in the aging process uh there's a big fight between two worm groups one of which said mutants that modified the activity were highly effective in others it said well maybe just a little bit and leaving all that stuff aside i don't think there's any evidence yet that resveratrol is good for you or that sirtuin activators slow the aging process i was invited to give a talk at searchers interesting at the height of all of this david stipp who's a wonderful science journalist has written a a wonderful book about the whole circus resveratrol story the youth pill or the youth fountain or the youth pill or something like that that's about right yeah it's a great book david's a fine writer so i went to circus i gave my talk on rapamycin which is what they wanted to hear and at the end i went to talk to their their director and i said so what do you guys what are you guys doing for resveratrol huh is this going to work he said oh well no i'm leaving the company i'm going to work for a company that works on it he named another chemical entirely different he was going to work on torrid hitters he wasn't going to work on resveratrol they'd already sold the thing or about to sell the thing to glaxo and he knew that it was tied to move out to inhibitors or compounds that had a greater likelihood of of actually working well we're gonna we're gonna come to one of those in a little while which is basically things that provide substrates for sirtuins as opposed to activators but nevertheless one of the other ones that sort of i thought was interesting that you studied not that you shouldn't have in the spirit of this being kind of a community effort was you know green tea extract does that do you remember that one at all i sure do tell me a little bit about that what was your expectation going into that itp well anybody in the world can suggest a compound or a group of compounds or a mixture of compounds you realize i'm going to be doing this now you're going to be getting these suggestions from me so just oh good yeah that's that's good news absolutely i'm sorry in advance each of these suggestions is evaluated by a group of five scientists initially our our access committee and then secondly following their advice the steering committee which i'm on makes the final cut so when people are recommending green tea extract they say there's a central compound that's probably the main player in green tea extract many people have said it's good for you traditional chinese medicine etc please test it and so when we evaluate this there are all sorts of pros and cons we strongly prefer single compounds purified synthetic compounds to complex mixtures but we can see sometimes the ground for testing a complex mixture may be that five or six or seven things in balanced amounts might together be good for you even if no one of them used singly might be beneficial we also like to test things that have acquired a popular reputation for being healthful if the popular reputation is even if it's based on a thousand-year-old tradition of traditional medicine it still might be right and so some of the time if we stumble on something that will work that would be great news and if it doesn't work then we feel we've done a public service we certainly have not proven that green tea extract might not be good for people but it'll we hope slightly take the wind out of the sails of that discussion if we demonstrate when we give to give it to animals it didn't do any good to them the other one that caught my eye by the way on the list of on the much longer list of failed compounds and you made a good point right which is the failures are just as important as the successes right i mean some of the most important insights are these things that don't work that we've long held beliefs around methylene blue caught my eye i was sort of interested to see methylene blue curcumin many of these other things that have been tested you go back and revisit rapamycin again through a high medium-low dose i mean you really put the screws to rapamycin to continue to demonstrate its efficacy really rapamycin is in some ways probably one of the three poster children of the itp four now counting conical flows yeah yeah yeah exactly let's talk about 17 alpha estradiol yeah i know more about the estrogens than the average person i got to be honest with you i don't have a clue what 17 alpha estradiol is i'm very familiar with 2 4 and 16 hydroxy estradiol and estron and all these other things i can't for the life of me figure out what 17 alpha can can you help me understand where this shows up is there an actual molecule is there a drug that we have what was the genesis behind this plan yeah the genesis was a guy named jim simpkins he's a pharmacologist he's always interested in estrogen receptors and he tried to make a compound that was like estrogen that is 17 beta estradiol generically crudely referred to as estrogen 17 beta estradiol but which had much lower affinity for the classical receptors for the estrogens er alpha and beta so he synthesized 17 alpha estradiol which is very much the same compound except for one of the bonds tilts up instead of tilting down and in jim's work mostly in tissue culture cells he found that yes it was tenfold less active at least than a 17 beta estradiol and in fact whatever activities it was having on his cells and culture it worked just as well if you deleted the classical estrogen receptors so when he gave it to mice he found it was non-feminizing when you give it to male mice it did not induce the secondary sexual characteristics that the stronger estrogens like 17 beta estradiol estrogen would do so his idea and i'm not endorsing this i'm just reporting it is that giving an estrogen to male mice might make them live as long as female mice the female mice live five or ten percent longer than males he said maybe it will turn them into females but it would be a much better compound for people because no man wants to look feminine so if it works that people will give it to men and they'll live as long as women but they won't be embarrassed by looking like a girl that was enough to get it through the steering committee and when we gave it to mice it indeed had a terrific effect on male life span it had no effect whatever now in in three separate studies in female life span in fact the males given the drug live not only longer than regular old males they live longer than regular females it's not merely moving the male curve to be coincident with the female curve it's moving way past where the normal females live so why it works only in males we have a clue but we don't know for sure and we certainly want to know why the effect is so dramatically sex specific so that we can try to figure out a way to get around that obstacle and to get it to work in females as well now if i'm looking at my table correctly the 17 alpha estradiol in cohort 5 extended median survival in males but not maximum and of course no it doesn't well that was used at a low dose at a low dose when we went back and we did it at a three times higher dose it extends our measure of maximum longevity as well as median longevity and at all three sites yep i see okay so that's the difference is the at the 14.4 parts per million versus the lower dose yeah when we got that first the first result somebody said quite plausibly hey i'll bet it would work better at a higher dose so we tried that now again i just don't know enough about mice but what's the menopausal situation of mice how long are the female mice exposed to estrogen to 17 beta estradiol i don't know about when the estro cycle ceases in mice it depends a lot on the strain and as you know dozens to hundreds of inbred strains and they each have slightly different characteristics in general production of new healthy pups tends to slow down when the females are 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 months of age and the cycles start to get irregular and then to stretch out and then decease altogether but this is something i don't know very much about and to quote details i'd have to talk to somebody who actually knows a lot more than i do about mouse reproductive endocrinology is there an actual molecule of 17 alpha estradiol that is there an ind for this very good question and the answer is not really well known there is one obscure paper by a swedish or finnish group maybe 15 years ago that said they had detected 17 alfastradiol but only in the brain and in fact they said that they had isolated in the brain a receptor which they called the estrogen x receptor that was relatively specific for 17 alpha estradiol the one that's working in our tests but i have never seen that repeated i actually following up sort of your line of thinking corresponded a little bit with two or three of the american scientists who are authentically steroid chemists and who spend their whole life synthesizing various derivatives of and i kept i asked them what is 17 how fester dialed is it anywhere does it do anything and they all said good question i don't know so i know nothing about it but they should know something about it and apparently it's distinctly under investigated so even after your findings which are quite impressive it hasn't been pursued as an investigational new drug i'm over my head here i don't know the answer to that question certainly nothing has come to my attention about it's being investigated but i i will i could well have missed something there is an you know an awful lot of in attention to developing novel estrogenic compounds really good academic labs and i'm sure 10 times that much work in pharmaceutical firms there are major papers in important journals about here are 30 or 40 different steroid compounds that do not have that side effect or do not have this do not bind to this receptor etc i don't know that literature very well and i'll bet a great chunk of it is kept quiet by pharmaceutical firms so i i'm not confident that anyone outside those firms really knows the answer to your question interesting do you remember the rationale for your salic acid i will have to double check i believe it feels almost exactly like my qualifying exam sorry ursulic acid i think is the one that changed retinoid receptor activation there was a claim from gretchen darlington and some of her colleagues saying that the long-lived mice the ames dwarf mice had turned on a whole batch of genes that related to bile acids and the bile acids work through some molecules related to the retinoid acid receptor or something like that ursolic acid was proposed as a way of getting at the bile acid issue but the chances that i'm right on this point are only about 50 50. i'd have to check my notes to be sure the reason i ask is there was a human-based supplement for this that was all predicated around improving body composition but my my one recollection of it was it was not orally bioavailable it was only you had to use it in sort of a topical fashion which sort of rendered it you know not particularly helpful rich can you tell me a little bit about the work being done on hydrogen sulfide there's a colleague of mine who died recently a guy named jay mitchell a wonderful scientist jay was really interested in the idea that hydrogen sulfide might be an important controlling element in the aging process and had published a long and really impressive series of papers uh on that so he suggested that we give to mice a drug that would it would break down to produce hydrogen sulfide a drug called sg1002 so we tried it and we messed up we had control mice that were on the wrong control food and the mice given jay's drug did better than the mice or the raw control food but we didn't publish that because we were not sure what would have happened if we'd use the right control food so we're repeating that now we've we've fixed our mistake and we don't have data yet in about a year we'll know whether jay's hunch that giving mice a drug that would increase their internal generation of hydrogen and sulfide will be good for them i'm certainly hoping it's correct when we did it wrong the drugs seemed to work so i'm hoping that when we do it right the drug will continue to work but we don't know yet okay so let's go to one of your more recent findings this sglt2 inhibitor can categorize yeah yeah so this is a drug which is widely available this class of drug has been around for what probably a decade right i think that's right yeah used pretty readily in patients with type 2 diabetes blocks the reuptake of glucose so that more glucose is excreted in the urine yes but only when you're hyperglycemic the the one of the nice things about it in clinical practice is you can make somebody hypoglycemic put them at risk that way so it it affects the process in the kidney that deals with very high glucose levels without having much scope for causing toxicity now this increased median lifespan in the male mice by 14 maximum extension of nine percent it had no effect on the females that's right is this another one of those drugs where you have any insight into differential plasma levels between the males and females we uh actually did measure that and it's in the paper the females if i recall actually had higher levels slightly higher levels than the males the absence of an effect in females is not explicable on the idea that they don't get the drug into their blood what do you think could explain the difference in the effect here gosh i wish i knew when you take this together with the acarbo's results you're led to the inference and this is only a tiny baby step forward something about aging in the male mice depends a lot on staying away from really high glucose levels now whether that means that high glucose in the males triggers a circuit in the hypothalamus which is bad for you or something i mean from here on in it's all hand waving the mice are mostly dying of cancer both the males and females about 80 percent of the deaths are due to some form of cancer a wide range of different kinds of cancers but cancer in these mice and most mice is the predominant cause of death so you could probably start to think about why is it if you want to avoid all sorts of cancers high glucose is a really bad thing for you if you're a male that's the sort of line of argumentation you'd want to consider but that's certainly unsatisfying we don't know we would love to know that well to me why high glucose is bad for cancer is a relatively straightforward question at least compared to why disproportionately for males and females so let me start by asking another question if you do nothing and just observe these animals as though you were an actuary what is the distribution of death for females versus males you mean the age of death no the cause of death yeah about 80 cancers in both oh it's 80 in both yeah different kinds of cancer both the leading cause for both males and females is hematopoietic cancers of one sort or another lymphomas are related uh histiocytic sarcomas and other sorts of lymphoid tumors then in the females the next leading cause is mammary cancer and the third leading cause is either liver cancer or a fibrosarcoma in the males the second is lung cancer and then liver cancer or fibrosarcoma so all of them it's cancers cancers cancers and how much is hematopoietic in each about 30 of the deaths okay so that's hard that's hard to make sense of i guess i mean are there enough data on the glucose and insulin sensitivity of each of those relative types of cancer that you could make the case that i mean i got to be honest with you that's a little counter-intuitive based on human data because obviously in humans the mammary cancers would be quite glucose and insulin sensitive whereas the lung would not be so you'd actually expect the opposite if that were true in mice that you would expect the females to disproportionately have the benefit but i mean that's a lot of hand waving right so i'm just curious if we have you know more molecular data about pi3k activity or other activity igf activity in these animals as it pertains to their cancer risk these are really good questions and i've been trying to urge my cancer biology friends to start digging in and answering those questions as a sort of the framework you can think as you were thinking maybe the glucose thingy works on the cancers but it's also possible that the glucose excursions are working on an anti-cancer defense some aspect of immune defenses or it could be and this is my hope but it's only a hope it could be that the glucose specific excursions are modifying some fundamental still undiscovered element of the aging process in the hypothalamus maybe it has to do with the susceptibility of the hypothalamus to inflammatory change or something like that differentially in males and in females and that this nebulous sort of change has an impact on the cancer or an impact on anti-cancer defenses or something any of that is in my view about equally likely to be true but at present none of it gives us much of a hint as to why these drugs have a much more striking effect in the male mice did you see the same effect here that you did with a carbos in that the hemoglobin a1c was unaffected i'm not sure i'd have to go back and check the paper my memory which may be incorrect is that there was a figure showing no difference no effect on hemoglobin a1c in the conangle flows in paper which is surprising because it is affected in human diabetics it's you can really move hemoglobin a1c into the health down into the healthy direction by conago flows and the other different sglt2 inhibitors but i if i recall it did not produce that effect in the mice we don't know whether the canaglia flows in effect is on glucose we don't know whether it's on sglt2 it also has an effect on sgl t1 and there are now reports appearing in the literature quite striking ones some of them in clinical settings showing effect on tumors specifically on other aspects of other kinds of disease human effects on heart attacks independent of whatever's happening in terms of glycemic control so this the shortest simplest explanation it's affecting glucose may not be right there are other ideas that deserve a lot of exploration yeah we are very excited about these this class of drugs clinically in our practice the cardio protection renal protection obviously the glycemic benefits are all pretty exciting and of course this brings us to an interesting contrast right i think if if rapamycin is one of the most remarkable success stories of the itp in terms of its consistency personally for me the biggest surprise of the itp is the failure of metformin can you say a little bit about that how was the study done what are the possible blind spots i mean obviously metformin succeeded when paired with rapamycin but you could argue that's just rapamycin but metformin alone did not succeed and has it only been run in by itself once or twice so i'm not surprised there are all sorts of reasons in which metformin failure is unsurprising one is it might be really good for people and not good for mice why i said people are organized very differently it's also possible that we use the wrong dose if we'd use a dose that was twofold lower or twofold higher it might have been great or if we had given it for a few months and then taking it away for a month and then given it for a few months that might have worked as well you know we tried it at one dose with one continuous dosing schedule it did not produce a significant effect but that's not to say that it could not work in mice and even if it could not work in mice that's not to say that it might not be good for people so there are all sorts of ways in which you might get a disparity you asked how many times metformin has been tried it's been published twice once by rafa to cabo once by us in our study it led to no significant lifespan extension in either males or in females in rafa's study which i'm about to be critical of it produced no effect in females and rafa alleged that it produced a significant effect in the males now the p-value was .046 so it was really close and it was it was not the test that he ordinarily uses our lab and almost everybody including rafa always uses the log rank test and he didn't use the log rank test instead he picked another test which gives special weight to early deaths and if you use that special specific test then it is statistically significant at a p-value of 0.046 my hunch is it didn't work with the log rank yeah it tried it failed so they went statistics shopping found one where it got to .046 and published that i have asked rafa for the data privately two or three times he's always agreed to send it to me over the last three or four years but it hasn't actually arrived yet well maybe this podcast will help speed that up i hope so in any case whether or not his was just over or just under the border of statistical significance it was a small effect at best and in itp it didn't work at all but it might work might be good for people yeah well that i mean i guess that's the challenge here right is you've got you've got these agents that work under so many different circumstances and again you can probably tell rich my bias is you know i think rapamycin is an amazing agent here and i think it's one that warrants lots of investigation in humans because i think that the non-human literature are so compelling right both in terms of the actual drug use and also the mechanism of action and the genetic manipulation all the way from you know worms fruit flies obviously you know mice yeast matt caberlin's dogs it just over and over and over again demonstrates efficacy and even when you look at the you know softer endpoints in humans software's maybe the wrong word but less longevity specific but you know things like immune function things like that it always seems to be pointing in the right direction now in metformin we have this undeniable data of diabetics that take it versus diabetics that don't and you know you can slice that 10 ways to sunday it always seems to favor metformin in that diabetic group but as near barzillai and many others are interested in what does that tell us about non-diabetics is there a way we can better get at that answer while we await the results of a tame study to get you know funded and executed is there another itp we should be doing well the principle stimulus for at least for me and i assume for those who've been spending their time developing this test of metformin in aging people the tame study was a paper doubtless familiar to you an epidemiological paper the point of the paper was not so much that metformin was good for diabetics which everybody knew it was it was that the mortality risk of diabetics on metformin was actually better than non-diabetics of the same age and sex so that doesn't prove that metformin is good for non-diabetics but it's certainly a hint in that direction now as an observational study not a controlled randomized clinical trial of course so it might not be right but that was a really big hint that if you're a person non-diabetic and you're not taking metformin your chances of death over a wide range of ages are actually worse than a diabetic person as long as a diabetic person is being protected by metformin so my view even though it's a single study and others now need to be done and all sorts of caveats need to be kept in mind during the interpretation that's a hint that metformin may well be pretty good for non-diabetic people as well and studying that in terms of a randomized clinical trial strikes me as justified it's very expensive it's very ambitious to meet the fda criteria and in order to try to get results before they all become emeritus or retire they need to have endpoints that can be measured five to oh gosh as many as seven years in the future so for human lifespan it's kind of a short term but it may work and i it's not my money and i can't wait to see what they come up with so there's one more compound i want to talk about which by the time this podcast will come out will be at least in a pre-print and that's nicotinamide riboside i guess it's safe to say that if resveratrol was the in molecule of the early 2000s the next big in molecule has been anything that points to nad again i don't know how many times i have to get an email or a text message saying hey what do you think about these nad iv clinics i really have heard great things about this and what do you think about nr and nmn and these sorts of things so i guess we'll i'll give a really really really fast or i'm going to let you give a really really really fast explanation of what nad is why it might matter and why we give nr orally as a precursor to it i'll be glad to i feel a little embarrassed because you know 10 times more than i do about this particularly in a clinical context if you had to make a list of the 10 or 15 or 20 molecules that are part of intermediary metabolism that may well be really important elements in the control of aging rate nad and its chemical derivatives would surely be on that list it's at the top of your list for some people it's sort of in the middle for others at the bottom but it it deserves a lot of attention and there's a great deal of pretty strong data suggesting that aspects of aging and age sensitive diseases age-associated diseases can be altered by making nad more or less available one of the reasons it's gotten so much attention is because of clever marketing there are scientists who have made a great deal of money by making more or less unsupported you can't sue them they're not lying exactly but they're sort of winking and nodding saying hey take this formulation it'll sort of do some goodish stuff to your nad we're not allowed to say we'll treat any disease because we would run afoul of the fda but wink wink try it it's a nutritional supplement and they've made a lot of money and gotten a lot of attention some of it positive and some of it negative the reason that nr nicotinamide riboside was recommended to us by a company that wants to sell it is that it's orally bioavailable and more stable than some of the other ways that have been proposed by mouth can you disclose which company asked there's probably only two public i think it's chemodex i think it's public knowledge is who's who suggests things to the itp so they said we'll we'll provide it to you guys test it you can publish the results positive or negative we just in the interest of science let's find out that's a highly honorable and sensible thing for them to have done so we tested it it's a bioavailable form we used a dose that they suggested and the paper that will have come out by the time this podcast becomes available suggested that in our did not extend life span in our mice there are all the usual caveats maybe it would have if we'd given it at a higher dose or at a lower dose in addition we tried a little bit to detect it in various tissues there's a collaborator who looked at the brains and the muscles and the hearts and we were not able to demonstrate a consistent major change in nad levels in these tissues nad is a highly active molecule as of course you know the turns over constantly and with a time scale of a few seconds to a few minutes can go way up or way down in given cells depending on how stressed one is or how high the glucose is or whether you're exercising all that stuff so it's possible that we failed to measure major changes in nad in our treated mice because we should have fasted them or we should have let them rest for a few hours or we should have gotten the blood out in a different way or something like that but in any case the the observations that we're confident of at the dose we used it did not produce a lifespan effect did it produce any benefit well we would have to go and check for other things right the first time we do a study with a new drug lifespan is the only thing we measure we would love to be able to measure immune function and vision and hearing and cardiovascular function etc but those are expensive and if we did those we would have to spend money on them and cut back by a factor of whatever two or three or five the number of drugs we test so we generally reserve those health outcomes only for those drugs that give a lifespan benefit and nr did not in our hands give a lifespan benefit you started the nr at about eight months of age so again this is a reasonably young man animal uh in its 20s the equivalent of a human do you have a sense of what the dose was on the scale of where humans are taking this commercially i believe humans are typically oh god i don't even know taking probably a few a couple of grams of this stuff a day i do not know i'd have to look it up but the company basically had you utilizing a dose that they felt was consistent with what humans are being encouraged to take we followed their recommendations we picked a dose that they said would be an appropriate good starting dose for our tests and we've we followed their guidance on this it's a little tricky when you're going to give something for life span if they're doses that are often of drug x i'm not talking about nr but doses of drug x that are typically given to people for a month or two and it's really good and doesn't produce side effects you still worry that might not work for mice because if you're going to give it to them the whole lifespan side effects may accrue so if there is an ambiguity we we want to start usually with a pretty low dose because if they're gonna be on it from the from four months of age until death keeping the dose nice and low is probably an important precaution against unanticipated side effects that might not be seen in an acute treatment how often do you guys see unanticipated consequences of exactly what you describe where side effects don't show up in the first year of the mouse receiving the drug but show up later well we have not yet and this surprised me somewhat we have not yet found any drug suggested to us that caused a shortening of the lifespan none of the drugs that we've used has caused a significant decline in lifespan there were one or two where the lifespan went down five percent or eight percent but it didn't achieve statistical significance now there could be some side effects that we don't look for maybe the mice have problems with hearing or sight or memory or muscle function or something like that which we would never look never see unless we look for them it really seems that there are three really important takeaways from what are you at now 18 20 cohorts of itps i mean almost 100 studies here basically 100 experiments which is mtor matters less glucose is better than more and sex-specific steroid hormones probably do something relevant right i mean is that if you were at a dinner party and someone asked you to give them the most salient findings of the last two decades would would that be a fair assessment i think the points you're making are really good ones but it's not quite the way i would put it if i were allowed to pick only three okay give me your three yeah the first point i'd make is the one we began at the beginning of this conversation which is that by gosh you actually can put something in the food that extends healthy lifespan and it's an enormous effect 10 times better than a cure for cancer so in terms of the fundamental imagining of where medical research ought to go and what people who want to make their friends stay alive and healthy longer should think about our program shows that what they should think about is finding drugs that slow aging it seems obvious you know you and i are talking about it because we we sort of believe that we sort of think it's cool and interesting and important but that's most of my friends scientific and non-scientific they haven't decided that that's the case so i would take that as the first most important take-home message the second take-home message would be to my mind the really surprising finding that some of the time maybe even most of the time these drugs work even when you start them in middle age i would have guessed against that when we started i would have said you have to start in youth period but that was a bad guess and two drugs that we've tested so far work just as well in middle age and one works half as well so that was a bad guess and that's really important too in terms of both the understanding of aging and also thinking about transition to human usage the third point i would make of broad general applicability i would have guessed any drug that works is going to work in both sexes and that's mostly wrong we have two drugs rapamycin and one we didn't mention the amino acid glycine which have equally strong effects in males and females we didn't talk about glycine because it works in males and females significant but it's a really tiny effect and so it's sort of fallen by the y side as we've moved on to drugs with greater effectiveness but the sex specificity and the ability to start in late life were both surprises and open up new ideas about how how can you discover why it's working in old age and how can you discover why it's working in one sex but not both those are important research questions and we could easily take three or four or five times as many really good new labs in aging and devote them to trying to tease out those puzzles and then the fourth set of questions would be the ones you brought up you're pointing to specific molecular clues is it tor is it glucose are there sex specific hormone receptors in the brain that are important i think those are really interesting as well and in fact any post-doc or grad student who comes into my lab they get one of those to work on that's that's the cutting edge of turning this into a molecular and cellular understanding of what slows the aging process and where we ought to pay attention when we want to find new drugs that will work in just the same way so the points you've made strike me as highly pertinent very important for anyone who wants to work on something in this area but the three more general points that it works at all that it can work late in life and that it's often sex specific i don't want those to get lost in the shuffle because they fundamentally rearrange our ideas about aging about lay life disease and about what one ought to do if one was say in charge of america or the universe's medical research apparatus on that point rich if money were absolutely no object and the reality of it is it doesn't need to be as extreme as one thinks i mean but let's just say that the nih came along and said look we are going to give you the budget you need to study these questions in any animal what would you choose as the best model organism that would give you the trade-off of duration and closeness to humans would it be staying where you are where you have an advantage that you get answers quickly but the disadvantages you're quite far from humans or would you move more towards you know what we saw in the very famous caloric restriction experiments at wisconsin and nia in the 80s and 90s or sort of 90s through you know 2000s where you were very close to humans but obviously it took a long time to get the answer so i have two answers for you the first is the mouse and the other is it's a bad question if you ask a carpenter what is the most important tool you'll get the same sort of answer because the answer is the tool that i select depends upon the problem i have to solve i think that each of the major experimental animals that is currently receiving a lot of attention is doing something good they're molecular and genetic questions that are best addressed by flies and worms even though they don't resemble me and my mouse in more than cellular aspects but they're things that they can only solve that we can't solve and that's an important thing to understand in primates i think there are a few people who are starting to understand that rhesus is not where it's at marmoset is where it's at because marmosets are primates they are organized much like humans but they have a lifespan and average lifespan of maybe eight or ten years something like that so like dogs they have the advantage of a lifespan which is longer than we'd like but short enough that you can think about doing an experiment and completing it within about a decade some of the work has to be done in humans too for reasons i don't i don't think i need to convince you of the mouse is the correct answer to you know if you have to pick what it's got to be the mouse you said they're not much like people but of course they're extremely like people they have the hypothalamus they have the pancreas they have the beta cells they're very few things organs or cells or circuits or hormones or whatever that mice have but people don't have or vice versa they're so important subtleties yeah i i guess i'd push back a little bit in terms of some of the differences are profound right so one one profound difference is herbivores versus omnivores now that might pose a lot less of a difference for the itps than it does for one of my pet peeves which is the never-ending nutritional studies of mice which i find generally unhelpful for that reason that's right and we've even discussed it today in the context of looking at a carbos right that's a nutritional intervention in some ways and it might be a little bit difficult to extrapolate but i think the other area where we do need to be a little bit circumspect with the use of mice is that 80 of them die of cancers a third of which are hematologic whereas when you look at us all humans die with atherosclerosis about a third die from it and i think that is an important distinction that basically says this is this is just my own personal philosophy any effort to thwart human aging must be able to punch atherosclerosis squarely between the eyes so let me give you a different way of thinking about this let me try to change your personal philosophy here we gave them a lot of my some rapamycin and then instead of letting them die we euthanized them at 22 months of age when most of them were still alive and fairly healthy and then with the aid of a pathologist j irby wilkinson irby looked at dozens of different organs and sue brooks also looked at their tendons so their tendons were youthful their kidneys were youthful they did not have changes in the heart they did not have changes in the endometrium they did not have changes in the liver they did not have changes in the adrenal that were characteristic of 22-month old control mice so the implication here is that even though the leading cause of death was cancer the rapamycin was actually slowing a very wide range of age-associated changes now some changes and we don't know which ones they are produce cancer in mice and in people some changes and we don't know which they are produce atherosclerosis or strokes or diabetes in people and in a small fraction of mice so from my perspective the details of what you're going to die of whether it's mostly stroke mostly atherosclerotic in nature or mostly neoplastic they're certainly important if you're if you've got a patient you want to help that patient or if you're looking for disease-specific drugs but my interest is not related to that it's to what can we do to slow the aging process and i think it's a very plausible at least plausible idea that when you slow the aging whatever diseases afflict the members of that species will be slowed down as well alzheimer's disease for instance does not ordinarily occur in mice it's a obviously a major hassle for people yet if you make a mouse that has some aspects of alzheimer's disease and you give them these drugs the disease is postponed and so that's consistent with the notion that whatever diseases aging leads to in either species anti-aging medications will help cause of death is an important wrinkle but only an elaboration of the aging process in a species specifically and i think this also speaks to the importance of whenever possible starting younger although again rapamycin almost flies in the face of that but the earlier you would start the more opportunity you would have to beneficially impact those tendons those nephrons those cardiac myocytes and those neurons that's a really good general point i used to agree with that completely and now i think one has to answer that question directly point by point by point the fact that giving 17 alpha estradiol or a carbos or rapamycin to middle-aged mice and you still get a nice postponement of whatever the lethal process is that argues against the notion that many many things have to start early in addition this is again published now this is mike garrett's paper with john herrera and charlene day when they started treating some old mice with 17 alphester diol they postponed or reversed it's hard to tell muscle changes muscle grip strength changes rotor the ability to stand on a rotating rod and changes in old age and glucose tolerance so it may be that despite my personal intuition which is similar to the intuition that you just expressed the evidence starts to suggest some aspects of aging can be reversed or prevented even if you're starting in late middle age that would be cool if it was true i would have bet against it but i may be wrong has your conviction about any of the molecules you've tested in the itp led to you taking any i prefer not to answer that because i'm not a doctor and i would never ever wish to recommend drugs to someone else take them too seriously i wasn't going to ask you which but we'll leave it at that we'll leave it at that rich this has been an awesome discussion i i mean i was really looking forward to this and i i honestly think you have one of the coolest jobs in the world because you get to basically hear from anybody and everybody who has an idea about something that might extend life in a very straightforward intervention which is if a person if a person in this case if a mouse takes this drug will it extend their life and you get to test this in a highly reproducible manner with two great colleagues and you've basically got this well-oiled machine that produces these fantastic studies which both positive and negative continue to add to the body of knowledge we have i want to close with something really funny and you probably don't want me to do this but i'm going to do it anyway so in 15 years ago you wrote something really hilarious at the mit technology review do you know where i'm going with this i remember the piece pretty well yes i wrote it right here at this desk okay so early morning it was six in the morning i couldn't sleep i had an hour i just felt in the mood to be mean so i wrote the piece yeah so aubry de grey must have done something on television that you must have watched had he basically gone on tv and said no i made that part up i'd i'd been hearing aubrey speak uh over and over and over and over again for many years i fantasized that he had made a television appearance and i wanted to enlist his help and basically what you said is i'm going to read just the first part of this dear aubry so the mit tech review published this i saw you on tv the other day and i was hoping that now that the aging problem has been solved you might have time to help me in my publicity campaign to solve a similar engineering challenge one that has been too long ignored by the ultra-conservative frady cat mainstream scientific community the problem of producing flying pigs a theoretical analysis of the problem using the fastest available modern computers shows that there are a mere seven reasons why pigs cannot at present fly one they do not have wings two they are too heavy to get off the ground three the so-called law of gravity four they cannot climb trees five hair instead of feathers six they do not wish to fly and seven they do not tweet now this is really funny because you wrote this prior to twitter when i read this i was like what does tweeting have to do with anything and of course i had to remind myself twitter didn't even exist in 2005. i'm not going to read the rest of this but we're going to link to it in the show notes because it is a brilliant you go you go into great detail elaborating on each of your points but this is to me really a great example of who you are right which is you're grounded in reality and you you don't buy into this idea that that immortality is in our future and you view it as an enormous win if there's a drug out there that can extend human life by 25 i'm in your camp rich i'm i'm so i'm highly biased and i've seen nothing to suggest that immortality is in our future and frankly i'm not sure it should be even if we were ever given the choice but boy 10 to 15 improvement in our lifespan and health span would be a remarkable achievement and if there are molecules that can do that i'm glad you're working on them well i'm delighted to have been invited a friend of mine said that he'd been on your podcast a number
