## Description

Full title: #61 – Rajpaul Attariwala, M.D., Ph.D.: Cancer screening with full-body MRI scans and a seminar on the field of radiology

Original release date: 7/8/19

In this episode, radiologist/engineer, Raj Attariwala, explains how he was able to apply his engineering background to create a unique MRI scanner that is capable of constructing whole-body images with a resolution that is unmatched in the industry. Peter and Raj discuss the implications of such a robust, radiation-free imaging tool on the early detection of cancer. They dive deep into cancer screening and define terms such as sensitivity and specificity that are necessary to really understand this complex space. They then describe the biggest risks involved in this type of screening (false positives) and how Raj’s unique technology and process might drive down this risk substantially. But before that, they discuss all the common imaging technology from X-ray, to CT scan, to PET scans, to ultrasound, to MRI, and more. They touch on the history of each, how they work, the usefulness and limitations of each of them, as well as the varying risks involved such as radiation exposure. If you are interested in cancer screening and/or you’ve ever wondered how any radiology tool works, this episode is for you.

We discuss:
-Raj’s road from engineering to radiology [7:45];
-How X-ray works, the risk of radiation exposure, and the varying amounts of radiation associated with the different imaging technologies [18:00];
-Computed tomography scans (CT scans): The history of CT, how it works, and why we use contrast [27:45];
-Ultrasound: Benefits and limitations, and a special use for the heart [40:45];
-Detecting breast cancer with mammography: When is works, when you need more testing, and defining ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’ [51:15];
-Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): How it works, defining terms, and looking at the most common types of MRI [1:03:45];
-Brain aneurysms: Using MRI to find them and save lives [1:23:45];
-Raj’s unique MRI technology [1:30:00];
-The risk of false positives in cancer detection, and how Raj’s MRI can reduce the number of false positives (i.e., increase specificity) [1:43:40];
-The unique software Raj created to pair with his MRI machine [1:51:15];
-Comparing the radiation exposure of a whole-body PET-CT to Raj’s equipment (DWIBS-MRI) [1:53:40];
-How diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has revolutionized cancer screening [1:55:15];
-Why a DW-MRI is still not a perfect test [1:59:00]; 
-The potential for advancing MRI technology: Where does Raj think it could improve in the next 5-10 years? [2:03:00];
-Are there any commercially available scanners that can match the resolution of Raj’s images? [2:06:00];
-Machine learning: When and where might machine learning/AI impact the field of radiology? [2:08:40]; and
-More.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. Raj Atari wala Raj is an amazing guy I've known him for several years he's incredibly well trained he first actually went down the engineering pathway doing his PhD in biomedical engineering at Northwestern then decided he wanted to go into medicine and sort of apply his engineering approach to that so he went back to medical school did his residency in radiology and then went on to specialize in nuclear medicine and spent a great deal of time at some of the top institutions in North America Memorial sloan-kettering UCLA USC etc he's now back in Vancouver and what he's been up to for about the past decade has been effectively creating a new way of doing

[00:04:51] MRI so he's sort of what I think can only be described as an MRI ninja and that is to say he's been able to tinker with the hardware in the software to create a completely revolutionary product and process by which to look at the body using this technology of magnetic resonance now I think there's a bit of a technical episode but I also think it's one that anybody who's ever had an x-ray CT scan ultrasound mr in their life needs to listen to why because truthfully most doctors don't actually understand this stuff in great detail you you have to really go out of your way in medical school and residency to understand radiology I was obsessed with it I went out of my way to learn about it I learned a little bit about it but obviously nothing to the level of what someone like Raj knows and so what we did in this episode which you can sort of divided into two halves is as follows the first half is sort of a history of radiology so we start with talking about what an x-ray is how it works what the radiation does and doesn't mean CT scans ultrasounds PET scans nuclear medicine scans all of these things and I promise we've done this in a way that is really geared towards the patient I think we do a pretty good job of always bringing it back to language that makes sense and we don't get terribly lost in the physics and of all areas in medicine where you can get lost in the physics this is head and shoulders above the rest second half of this episode we really do this deep dive into cancer screening and this particular type of MRI technology that rod has almost single-handedly developed although he would probably bristle at the sound of me saying that because he's just such a modest fellow what I enjoy about this episode is it gives give me a little bit of a chance to talk about cancer screening this is something I'm incredibly passionate about and it's something I love talking about with my patients the show notes for this are going to be important because one radiology is obviously a very visual field you see things and much more than you sort of hear things so we're gonna do a great job to hair a lot of what we discuss with images especially once we get into the confusing MRI stuff and we try to explain the difference between a t1-weighted image and a t2-weighted image in a diffusion-weighted image and things like that the second thing is we're going to link to some of the material that we use with our patients on cancer screening because I know that's a very controversial topic and I suspect that this episode is going to generate just a lot of controversy but I want to be clear that cancer screening is a very personal decision and it comes with risks and the biggest risk of course is a false positive which then leads to subsequent screening emotional distress potential harm we talked about all of this stuff and as I said we'll link to some of the materials that we've prepared specifically for our patients that I think just create a nice primer for how to go through that so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr. Raj Atari Walla a

[00:07:48] ROG thanks for carving some time out today in the middle of your busy day I've probably done what no one else has done before which is shut down this clinic huh that's a fantastic to see you again and to be here it's a pleasure as always what's the deal with Vancouver and uber I got off the plane this morning and tried to get an uber to come here and apparently there's no uber and Vancouver it's stunning everybody complains we all complain but I don't know somebody somewhere is not allowing it it was amazing I was in India and you can get uber in India yeah and it's not a

[00:08:22] Canadian thing because I heard in Toronto Toronto Calgary almost all the country just Vancouver yeah very well I'll reserve my editorial comments for myself well I've been looking forward to this for a long time Raj we've known each other for about four years I think we were introduced through mutual acquaintances who's a good friend of mine and has become very interested in your technology and I'm not sure even immature if you remember the context but the context was basically this person reaching out to me to say there's this really fancy MRI scanner up in Vancouver can you go check it out for me and at the time I was focusing a lot on different technologies that might be able to aid in the detection of atherosclerosis and he may have misunderstood what I was interested in but it was sort of pitched to me through that lens you and I hopped on a call

[00:09:15] I still remember where I was sitting actually in my office at the time it was probably yeah I was in January by the end of that call I was really interested and you said look I mean I think you should just come up to Vancouver get scanned and let's spend a day discussing it and the rest is history so you know what I wanted to do today was obviously talked a lot about aim which is the I guess it's the name is that no name of the company or is that yeah so actually what I did is I actually set up aim is a private MRI company and we basically put in the MRI machine so I could play with it that's one of the problems of being an engineer and so aim is the name of the scanning company the clinic but we've actually now kind of moved it into pre Nouveau and what pre-new vu is about is actually to basically sort of put the power of preventive medicine into patients hands yeah well we'll talk a heck of a lot about this but let's talk a little bit about your background because that was one of the things that right off the bat made me realize that this was gonna be interesting discussion

[00:10:10] I even in medical school just took a huge interest in radiology I never thought for a moment I would become a radiologist but I knew that whatever type of medicine you practice you have a choice which is basically you can just be confused and intimidated by all of these scans that your patients get or you can at least try to understand them and have some hope of appreciating the the risks of them the benefits of them the subtleties etc so when I did my radiology rotation I was probably the most eager student who wasn't going into radiology and I remember and I still have my notes but I took I mean maybe fifty pages of notes drawing coils and all sorts of things so let's start at the beginning you have a background in engineering which a lot of radiologists seem to have right it's actually um common in radiology it's like basically there's a lot of Technology and radiology and so as a result prax those of us who actually are technophiles and so my background actually I started out in chemical engineering and then during that period of time kind of realized that I actually kind of liked the body and physiology and how that works and as a result I then went into biomedical engineering where did my masters in PhD in biomedical engineering in northwestern during that period of time I was actually working on fluid mechanics where actually looking at blood flow and hemodynamics and all sorts of complicated things and we also actually did what engineers do we actually had all these manual systems that we were using to measure blood flow and blood pressure and we decided okay let's build a robot to do it instead so we did and this robot that we actually built allowed us to do keyhole surgery in the eye that wound up attracting a lot of attention from physicians from top-tier universities all over the United States from Mass General everywhere and as engineers the attitude was we can build anything you want what do you want a lot of times physicians can never answer that I was working with a lot of these top tier guys like editor-in-chief of the different medical journals and ophthalmology and it was like they were speaking different language and I just didn't understand what they were talking about and so I actually kind of decided okay well let me apply to medical school and see what happened so I can actually kind of learn this language and kind of learn more about medicine and so I applied and I then I actually kind of got accepted and I was like mmm do I want to do this it's like I'm really an engineer and was born an engineer so my

[00:12:34] PhD advisors famous last words were that the engineering world will always take you back so I went off to medical school and actually hated every minute of it it was kind of like I need to know more I'm one of those kids who's kinda like why why why why why how does this work explain this to me I don't get it and realize that there are a lot of things in in the body and physiology and pathophysiology that we just don't understand despite the massive amount of literature that's out there in the medical world you really couldn't find a lot of the answers of why things go wrong and how they go wrong so then I'd wind up sort of exploring okay how do we advance understanding of what's going on in the body like the simple aging process what happens why does everything change why people could answer it instead it was like okay memorize his list of changes I'm like okay great let me try and remember all that and what I would actually start to boil down to is that I would actually go back to my engineering pathophysiology texts and I could actually read them and talk to the PhD guys and they would actually sort of give me the theories on what they thought was happening and when you actually got that theory it was almost like planting a seed then you actually kind of understood how the entire tree would look and that's when I said okay maybe this is good but I still need my technology where is technology going we worked on so the very first surgical robotic machines ever built my colleagues presented the first teller robotics telepresence conference ever held in the United States at the same time the group that made the da Vinci was there I kind of looked inside lists there's not a lot of space for robotics because people don't want machines operating on them as a former surgeon

[00:14:11] I'm sure you probably feel the same way you don't want a machine operating on you unless it's going to be better so that's when I decided okay the technology that people understand doctors understand is a picture and that picture is radiology and that's really where all the technology is and so actually started in an area - called nuclear medicine which is a sort of a small specialty within radiology which is where you're actually looking at functional imaging how things work how do things change what happens over time and really enjoy that area because it was sort of showing you what's happening when things are normal and then when things become abnormal and it was actually one of these other amazing fields that in medicine there's a lot of shades of grey where as a nuclear medicine it's almost black and white it's there or it's not it's one of these very few areas where you actually get a binary choice of what's happening is there a problem yes or no as opposed to well there might be so that's actually what I liked about it but then I also kind of realized that radiology is basically very much like Anatomy you actually see what's going on you actually see the changes and you see the shapes of things and you use that very much as a blueprint for a building to actually kind of see what it does whereas nuclear medicine is kind of instead of the blueprint you actually kind of know there's all these people carrying letters moving in and out of this building we don't really know the detail where the building walls are but we know that there must be something happening there and hey when you put the radiology with the architecture together of the blue print of the building then you combine that with the people going in and out of it you realize it's the post office and you realize that these are postal workers carrying things and here's the geometry of the building so that power really is actually quite useful in the fact that it's really that there's this famous equation when people actually realize to put functional imaging or nuclear medicine imaging together the first device that did that was positron emission tomography and CT or PET CT and the famous equation is that one plus one equals three these two separate modalities of functional imaging and anatomic imaging come together to actually make something better than each part individually and so that's what really attracted me to to the whole field just because you could see what's going on and you can actually see the power of what's happening that was certainly one of the more powerful lessons I remember as a medical student when I went sort of headlong into radiology which was what I really liked about this rotation I remember I wish I could remember the names of the residents but they took me under their wing even though they knew I wasn't going to be a radiologist and as you know from being in medical school that's a little unusual typically the residents tend to gravitate to the students that are going to follow in their footsteps but I think they saw in me a genuine curiosity and they thought well look the smarter we can make this surgeon the better down the line for us radiologists and so I remember them taking me aside and saying look Peter anytime you order a test in the back of your mind you have to be asking yourself do you want anatomical information or functional information or both and the example you gave is a great one and in the show notes for this podcast will link to tons of pictures so that people understand what is meant by anatomic imaging and the way I would explain this to a person is an anatomic image has nice sharp edges it looks like what it is you're trying to take a picture of so the anatomic image of the brain shows all of the sub structures and when their radiologist looks at it he or she can make out every little blip and Bend and crevice inside of the brain and they can comment on different structures well there's a tumor here or there's a blood vessel that's slightly dilated there if you contrast that with the PET scan as you pointed out that's looking at a function of the brain which is how much glucose does it uptake and instead it lights up darker the more glucose that's being taken there and that's so you're near analogy the CT scan is showing the architecture of the post office but the PET scan is showing you the distribution of people moving into different areas of it and by putting it together that gives you a really powerful picture exactly and that's actually exactly how it works and you know one of the things that might be useful as well as if we kind of look at the different sort of techniques that are used between nuclear medicine and radiology we all know that imaging started with the simple x-ray but that was actually groundbreaking for the field of medicine let's start with that so everybody has seen an x-ray and

[00:18:19] I think most people if they can close their eyes and picture it now or look at an image kind of know directionally that an x-ray is nothing more than a series of contrasts going from black to white and everything in between so at the highest level how do we take an x-ray what are we doing with those little electrons going through someone and how does it produce that image for sure and it's quite amazing actually how it was discovered by run and effectively what it is we're taking these high-energy wavelength and it actually penetrates right through their body and anywhere where there's something dense very hard like bone the x-ray beam can't make it through we've all sort of taken like a flashlight and sort of shown it through our finger and we can actually see the red light coming through well effectively that's what an x-ray is we're just taking higher energy wavelength that we can't see with our eyes and it's actually allowing the areas where there's things like air or soft tissues the x-ray penetrates right through it and goes right through who shines through where as in place of where there's bones the x-rays can't make it through so they actually get left behind and that's what gives us like the white pictures of the bone because the film that's exposed on the other side soft tissues the x-rays have gone through they turn it from white to black whereas in Bones the x-ray doesn't make it through because it gets left behind in the person and therefore on the film on the other side it stays white and back in the days of Rankin did they appreciate the damage of ionizing radiation or were there a number of casualties along the way from people being far too exposed to this type of energy unfortunately there were lots of casualties and actually our understanding of radiation has actually been moved by really traumatic events hiroshima nagasaki and things like that where there's been real radiation damage and we've actually been able to watch people over time and recently in the past ten to fifteen years an imaging we've actually realized the danger of this high-powered ionizing radiation and how it can damage cells and when the DNA of the cells get damaged there's a risk of inducing cancers with them and so we're actually starting to understand that more and more and we're actually starting to see that a lot of patients individuals are like look i know about the potential damaging effects of x-ray radiation therefore i don't want a lot of x-rays CT type scans now the way i generally talk about this with my patients i have a graph that i show them that on the x-axis lists a number of different technologies so a chest x-ray an abdominal x-ray a mammogram and they're generally in increasing amounts of radiation so at the top end of that spectrum you'd have a whole body PET CT just for if you want it to go is ionizing as possible and then the y-axis i use these units called millisieverts can you explain what a millisieverts exactly so a millisieverts actually the unit of measurement of radiation and it's actually set by the standards group system Internationale in France that actually sets what a standard dose of radiation is and now it's actually important that a lot of people really don't understand radiation there's good radiation there's bad radiation but radiation is anytime you actually have any ion that's actually releasing a component of its energy that energy has to get deposited somewhere it actually comes off as a photon of energy that has to by I guess energy effects go from it's never created it's never destroyed but it's actually transferred and so that energy if it doesn't go through you it's actually going to deposit in you and if it actually deposits in you that's where it can actually cause the damage and now when we look at all the different types of imaging as you talked about on one end you have the mammogram which actually has a very low amount of radiation in millisieverts it's usually about point zero five which is a quite negligible whereas on the other end of the scale you'll have the PET CT and now the PET CT basically couples the radiation from the CT and the CT scanner is basically a powerful x-ray that's spinning around the body and creating a three-dimensional view of you combined with the pet we is the positron emission tomography where you're taking radioactive glucose and you're actually labeling with fluorine and that fluorine is a radioactive fluorine 18 which actually now gives off a positron and that positron has tremendous amount of energy it's a highest energy that you can actually have in imaging for radiation and that's 511 kilo electron volts so very very high and so when you combine those two together you wind up getting typically when we actually give somebody radioactive glucose for a whole body scan for let's say they have cancer it's roughly 1 millisievert per Megan background but I guess I'm trying to convert the Canadian oh it's okay yeah we've got an international audience ship here you don't you don't have to make it

[00:22:53] Americanized right so we do it in mega barrels up here in Canada and so it's typically about 35 mega barrels per millisievert so typically somebody'll actually get the us dose would be about 12 millimoles and so that's about 212 millisieverts of radiation in addition to what they get on the CT scan so they could easily get 3040 millisieverts in total in that scan if they were doing her chest abdomen pelvis for example it's possible yeah and a lot of that radiation will come from the CT whereas with nuclear medicine what we typically do since we're actually gonna inject somebody with radioactive material as a results we've exposed them to that radiation so all parts of the body so as a result as it circulates through their entire body we want to take pictures of everything from head to foot because if we're gonna give somebody radiation we want to maximize the amount of data we're gonna extract from that exposure now I don't know in Canada what the number is but in the United States the NRC recommends that no one received more than 50 millisieverts in a year but of course not all of that can be assigned to radiography because living at sea level exposes you to what to millisieverts a year maybe three I mean

[00:24:01] I think even if you live at elevation people in Denver are getting probably six or seven millisieverts here at background I'm probably a bit off on that it might be a bit less that's right yep so the higher you go actually get more cosmic radiation and then as well certain geographies will actually have radon which is another exposure to the millisieverts and as well when you actually travel when you actually go up in altitude in planes we actually get a lot more radio exposure so that's why pilots for example actually when they were glasses they actually have to block the UV radiation that the UVA UVB and also the x-ray radiation which is much more prevalent at higher altitude their route matters I know I've calculated this for myself doing a lot of East West Coast travel fortunately not very much exposure

[00:24:47] I believe it's less than point 1 millisievert per round-trip but if you do LA over the pole right all of a sudden it goes up by again I don't want to misquote it because we have the data so I could just post it but it goes up by a nonlinear amount it's much more radiation when you cross the North Pole than just the extra distance you travel exactly and that's because of the ozone the less ozone you have at the poles the more exposure you're gonna get because the ozone actually absorbs the radiation so there's actually a calculator available online for people to actually determine how much radiation they're getting from exposure and it's actually required that pilots and flight attendants calculate their dose we'll make sure we find that in linked to that

[00:25:27] I just because the NRC says 50 is the limit I I've never really thought of that as we should go up to 50 I've thought of that is they probably have some reason to believe that successive years with exposure to 50 millisieverts is not a good idea do we have a sense of what the implication of that is in terms of normal physiology we do and we don't and actually a lot of the time our understanding of that really comes from like I said the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as well as other people like in Fuji reactor who actually got exposed and that's where understanding of the damage comes from it was actually a landmark paper out of Columbia that actually looked at the amount of radiation that people actually received from CT scanners and it actually forced radiology as a field to actually look at the potential damaging effect of x-ray radiation and what they actually kind of found is that the younger you are the greater the risk of cancer induction from CT scanners which is why in the pediatric world we actually try and really minimize the amount of dose that children in particularly getting and the sex as well matters so females are actually more sensitive to radiation than men meaning if you took a 20 year old male and a 20 year old female so both in their reproductive prime are you saying that the ovaries of the woman are more sensitive to DNA damage in the egg than the sperm are in the testes of the male exactly I didn't know that why is that and that actually has to do with the fact that the egg was actually produced during embryonic stage and as that DNA is effectively frozen in time and so as women are getting older and older they're releasing these DNA and eggs so therefore the young you are the fresher the DNA whereas you know when they're prime sort of round 12 which is when this DNA comes out of the I guess frozen state during the beginning of menstruation that's when these eggs start to be released actually twelve is sort of the worst time for females which is really sad because of course anybody who spent time in a hospital knows that there are invariably kids that need to undergo radiographic studies they only need to spend a few days in a cancer ward to realize all these poor children that are right at that age and they're being exposed to it and unfortunately there's not much of a choice and trauma is another area where the child comes in having sustained a bad injury in a car accident you go out of your way to use ultrasound whenever possible but invariably sometimes patients do require x-ray NCT radiographic studies so let's go back to the x-ray because I like I like where you started there historically and then you alluded to the fact that basically if you understand how an x-ray works if you truly understand what's happening then you understand what a CT scan is doing because it's just doing it in three dimensions spirally so the other thing about x-ray that I think is very interesting for anyone who spends time looking at it just to appreciate it even though it seems so simple is nothing in the body is two-dimensional so you talked about how this photon is going through the body and if it hits her rib well that's gonna show up as white whereas if it's passing through the lung between the ribs it's gonna show up as black but of course you could hit a rib on the front but not on the back you can hit a rib on the back and not on the front you can hit the sternum so when you look at an x-ray even to this day

[00:28:35] I'm still constantly amazed at what the collage looks like of overlapping layers of tissue and I mean I just don't think I ever got good at reading x-rays it was actually easier for me to I think cuz we just spend more time reading CT scans and there so much more an atomic detail but when I look at these old-time radiologists look at x-rays and the stuff that they could pull out of it I was blown away exactly it's true it's an amazing skill to actually be able to pull that 3d information of a 2d picture and if we actually kind of think about it our brain is designed to always imagine in 3d always think in 3d you know even if you actually somebody lost an eye they can still see in 3d and that actually has to do with the fact that that's how our brain was wired or I was wired and so the amount of information in x-ray is phenomenal but the biggest problem is that sometimes you're actually overlapping different things you just can't see so quite often the reason we do two x-rays when you do a chest x-ray you do a frontal PA as well as a lateral so you can actually try and mimic those two together to become a three-dimensional object and so when CT came around that's when it actually really allowed us to look at things in 3d and that's where surgeons and everybody else who actually operates and deals with people in 3d they can actually start to look at these and actually start to imagine what they're going to be operating on they actually kind of get the power of where the 3d image comes in and so a simple way to think about an x-ray is I try to tell people it's almost like an x-ray is based like a flash take a single flash and you get a picture whereas a CT scan is really like a searchlight and a boat kind of going around an island you actually get all the images the whole way around and then the equipment what it does it actually sort of sees how the intensity passes through let's say two panes of glass and comes out the other side and then you can actually start to evaluate what's going on inside that entire building the police officers use this all the time when they actually need to stake out a building or a site they actually use it to determine where the occupants are and that's exactly what an x-ray does it's triangulation effectively by spinning around in multiple different cycles by going around 360 degrees so we should clarify our semantics for people we use the term

[00:30:43] CT very loosely but it stands for commuted tomography and sometimes people back in the illness used to refer to it as cat scan or CAT and the a was for axial of course because it's going up and down the axial dimension of the person right when was the first CT scan put into clinical practice I mean would it have been in the early 80s or something like that or earlier earlier than that it was actually a EMI the Phonographic company that actually built the very first CT or cat scanner and I believe it was in the 70s even earlier it's actually been around for quite a while realistically that three-dimensional image really revolutionized medicine has did all imaging and the other thing that people will often hear about and I guess maybe patients don't hear about it as often but it certainly gets touted to them as a feature is they talk about the speed of these things they say this is this many bits or that many bits and presumably the first one was a four bit

[00:31:35] I think it was actually even less than that might have been two bit and actually just took a long time to go around and it was actually first used in the brain so let's explain what that means so two bit means you really only have two flashlights exactly or one flashlight one detector one exactly yeah it'll be easier I think when people look at pictures and we'll make this clear but you have this cylinder that goes around the patient who's laying down and there's one place where you shine the ionizing radiation and on the backside of the cylinder is where you read it and then that thing has to rotate so it's moving in its rotational plane but also moving up and down the Z plane in time correct right this makes so much more sense when I can use my hands by the way and so it's exactly like that basically 180 degrees apart you have the x-ray and the detector and then it actually starts to spin around and rapid revolutions so when you actually look at a machine there's the doughnut hole in the middle but around it there's actually the casing and these two parts a detector in the machine they're actually spinning around the body very very quickly it's actually quite fascinating maybe we can find a picture of one of these actually with the cover off yeah we'll find one and I feel like even when I got to residency which is so let's just say directionally twenty years ago I mean I still think people were using 16 and 32-bit scanners right yeah they were so 16-bit means you've got eight you're spaced out equally eight units and then you've got your eight detecting surfaces right and so what it winds up doing is so if you started that let's say the top of your head and go to the bottom we'll call that the axial dimension what the 8-bit would mean is that our eight slice

[00:33:10] I guess is probably the more correct term is that you basically have like one slice and then you're actually measuring immediately below it and immediately below that and so as a result as you're circulating the person of the patient you're actually doing eight slices at a time or sixteen slice at a time or thirty two slices of time so what that means is as you're rotating around the amount of coverage you get is more the higher the number of slices or you can actually also have thinner and thinner slices and the more thin you get the more detail you can get from a imaging perspective but the more radiation required to overcome the signal and the noise background yeah so what you're trading off is an optimization problem which is speed resolution radiation now where are we today I assume 256 is pretty common 256 is one of the common ones and it's actually used for things that are rapidly moving typically the heart the heart do we have a 512 yet in research really yeah you can actually make them as high as you want the problem is you eventually so to get to these diminishing returns of how then the slices are and how many images you need so if someone needed to scan a part of the body with a CT scan that wasn't moving functionally so something that's anatomically complicated like the pancreas but it's not moving like the heart are you good enough at 128 or 64 like this 256 offer an advantage doesn't really offer any advantage no you can actually eight slices work quite well as long as a person older breath and there's not a lot of movement eight slices work well one of the things I remember at Hopkins there was a radiologist there I don't know if he's still there is I think his name was

[00:34:41] Elliott Fishman and he was sort of the god of pancreatic reconstruction and of course this was important at Hopkins because at the time Hopkins was the epicenter of pancreatic cancer surgery and as important as it was to have a great surgeon John Cameron Charlie Oh etc that could do this operation it was as important to have an exceptional radiologist because as you know and maybe some of the listeners know many patients with pancreatic cancer technically shouldn't be operated on and you'd really like to know that before you enter the patient's abdomen which is not always possible but I remember that

[00:35:15] Elliott Fishman's images he would have these 3d reconstructions of the pancreas at a time I mean today that's pretty common but at the time like nobody was contemplating this kind of resolution and we would sit there on rounds and look at these images when they were still printed out on that sort of vellum whatever the hell plastic paper is you just couldn't believe it so to think that he was doing that with relatively few slices right exactly and like the whole power of that is again as I mentioned at the very beginning is that our brain thinks in 3d right and so the power of that as opposed to a good-looking slice by slice at a 2d image became very useful because now it became real it became what our eyes could see what our brains could see that actually really helped everybody plan their surgery and so it really was revolutionary to actually start to look at things in three dimensions now there's another element that we're going to introduce to this which is contrast so what is contrast why do we use it what contrast is and for the CT world it's actually an eye or donated material and so what I on does it actually absorbs the photons and so therefore makes things look white on a CT scan so it's like having liquid bone in your bloodstream pretty much a liquid photon absorber and so what it does is so we actually inject it into the vein and then we actually the heart pumps it around and so that means we're actually able to time when we actually take the

[00:36:34] CT image in order to be able to see what type of organ we're looking for so you can think of it if you actually get the arterial phase you'll actually see where the arteries are connecting to an organ or else you can wait for the venous phase or when the veins are returning blood flow from that organ and you actually see the entire detail of the organ and and what contrast really is is basically a way to light up the blood vessels and let up the capillary net and everything in between between the artery and the vein to allow us to see the anatomic detail from the perspective of adding blood to it and the name of course explains exactly why it's to create contrast exactly in the absence of contrast blood looks functionally like water I feel like I just want to go into this in so much detail that I'm also trying to be mindful of not going deeper than we need to but I guess we can talk about a Hounsfield unit because that will allow us to explain this contrast thing and tissue differences right exactly so what actually happened in CT is that Hounsfield came along and kind of said okay how do we calibrate this and so there's a range of how field units from - a thousand zero to two thousand and what that actually has to do with is density and so zero is defined as water a thousand is basically air and so as a result we can actually see the difference between the density of bone and air with water effectively in the middle so you have at plus 1000 it is black right at minus 1000 it is pure white pretty much yet and the biggest problem is that the I actually can't see that range so on our computers we actually will narrow down and look at well actually look at the higher

[00:38:07] Hounsfield units and we'll actually see lung then we go down we look at the denser material and that becomes bone but we can't see the whole thing right so you could technically specify multiple parameters you could specify the width of your window and where it is centered for example so if you wanted to look at lung you would Center it much closer to positive numbers and you don't need a very wide range do you no no no so what's a typical lung window like 800 plus or minus a hundred or something to that I mean I have no idea I don't even remember anymore but it's that's the gist of it right exactly yet and actually I don't even remember because you push a preset and once you set it you never really change it much so I had committed all of these to memory and medical school I was so obsessed with knowing the window for optimizing the viewing of every tissue as did I and then when you actually start to practically use it you kind of you wing it okay what happens that every person is actually slightly different position for contrast yeah and also it's like the amount of photons lost based on patient's body size the amount of absorption changes things so the numbers actually kind of move around and you wind up building a database in your mind of actually what you're looking at and so when you first start you actually push the buttons and it's like 6040 for the abdomen and you actually know all these numbers and then as you kind of go through you're like now I just need to see what I need to see what you said a moment ago it really brought back those memories of how horrible it looked if you tried to set the window to be the entire plus minus 1000 you could appreciate nothing and that sort of struck me as a metaphor for life at times which is like at a thousand feet sometimes you can tell I'm looking at a human but that was about it that was about the limits of detection but you could appreciate so many different things by zeroing in on the capillaries of the lung but you had to be in the right resolution versus if you wanted to look and see if they actually had a fracture people forget see T's are great for bones right and we're going to talk about how MRI for example is less great for bones so now we've got the CT thing so what we've established is that x-ray is a purely anatomic study there's nothing functional about it as you go into CT by itself it's also a very anatomic study you can add contrast to get even better information about the vasculature and you now have so much information that you can basically titrate or calibrate the window in which you look into that collection of radiation and specify your tissues CT scans are generally pretty quick right people who are claustrophobic don't tend to struggle that much in a CT scanner correct exactly and that's actually the real power of C to use the speed so for example in trauma settings that's what you want basically if patients not doing well in a trauma you want to put them through the CT scanner as fast as possible to get the information out as fast as possible and they're very fast so something that's even faster than CT and comes without at least one of its most significant drawbacks which is radiation is ultrasound so how does ultrasound work where does it fit into this and what are its limitations well the way ultrasound works is basically it's a high frequency so higher than what our ears can hear and effectively it's penetrating solid tissue so it's a high frequency sound wave versus an ionizing wave of energy exactly okay and so then it's actually going in every tissue interface it actually reflects back so it's very much like an echo so if you're standing in a mountain range and you yell out you actually hear the echo coming back and you could actually from that time you can determine how deep that tissue is and so with ultrasound we're just doing that very very fast and so at every tissue interface or every mountain range if we could you actually hear that reflection coming back you actually are able to then composite that as a representative of how deep things are away from you now there are animals that do this right including some of our closest relatives right they do and as bats also do them that's actually how they see and the bats resolution on this is what compared to say a dolphin I've read and I feel like I read this in the journal Science many years ago so I'm almost assuredly not remembering this correctly that the resolution which a whale or a dolphin could undergo sonography rivaled that of our finest medical equipment I mean their ability to discern was remarkable I found that amazing and of course in part that's because they're the medium through which they travel is water as opposed to what the bat has to do which is go through this poorly poorly dense air right exactly so traveling to the different material actually makes a very good way to explain it because in the air actually ultrasound doesn't penetrate very far because it's as high frequency and just you lose it because there's no reflection coming back whereas a more solid material like water or even dense material like organs in the body that actually reflects back easier and so it's actually that reflection that actually allows you to discern a different tissue types based on how quickly it reflects back now ultrasound can't harm you right you don't have ionized you could alter send yourself all day every day for the rest of your life and you're not increasing your risk of cancer whereas if you did a

[00:43:11] CT scan of yourself every month you're gonna be in trouble after several months exactly the drawback of ultrasound is the resolution doesn't seem to be as high right with ultrasound you're only looking at one slice right so you're only looking at one slice in time and you're basically kind of sweeping through an organ trying to composite those slices together in your brain to try and build that 3d model because like

[00:43:32] I said our brain always wants to build a 3d model so with ultrasound as you sweep through you get one layer then you get another layer then you get another layer and then eventually that's composited together to see what's going on an ultrasound also seems to really struggle when it encounters air inside the body so if you're trying to do an ultrasound of someone's aorta but their bowel is in front of it it becomes difficult to see for the same reason the bat can't really use high-frequency ultrasound to fly exactly and so that's why when for example you look at a female pelvis you want their bladder to be full because in their bladder being full of fluid it actually acts as a nice window to allow the ultrasound beam to pass right through to be able to see the uterus behind it I think any woman listening to this who's been pregnant that's got to be one of their most vexing parts of prenatal ultrasound as they always had to sit there in a waiting room with a full bladder waiting to have that ultrasound and of course that's why we like to do ultrasound on a fetus right is you're not causing any harm I mean certainly one thing I came to appreciate in the hospital was the skill that was required on the part of the person doing it so if you gave me the best ultrasound device money could buy today like you literally went but whatever ultrasound was at the absolute limit of technology and then you walked down to the local hospital here Vancouver general and you grabbed just middle-of-the-road radiology ultrasound tech someone who's maybe been out of school for a year and you gave him or her the worst ultrasound machine on the market there's no comparison who would be able to see more this is where a skill and experience is invaluable basically also dealing with a difficult patient body type is really critical and you can't replace that experience now there's a special subset of ultrasound that we do on the heart where did that idea come about who figured that idea again the value was like once you could actually find like a nice window that would actually allow you to miss the air in the lungs and actually kind of look at the heart you realize that boy you can actually start to see this two-dimensional plane and a heart quite well and as a result you can actually see where things were moving such as the valves in the heart or the walls of the heart and then as well you actually add something called Doppler which is basically the frequency bouncing off of blood vessel if it's going or coming the frequency is going to be different and so as a result you can actually now start to see how blood is moving and so that's what echo does and so it actually allows you to look at the heart and in detail with a very very thin window usually underneath the chest and around along yeah so anybody listening to this who's had an echocardiogram they know that the person doing it is really pressing quite hard it's somewhat uncomfortable for you the person getting the echo done and the reason is they've got that jelly on you which again is doing everything to eliminate even a drop of air between the interface and secondly they're pushing and they're grinding it in between the ribs and they want to get that view versus so that's a transthoracic echo where you're doing it over the chest in surgery often if we needed to look at the heart you would add the anesthesiologist would actually put the echocardiogram in the esophagus and you get an even better view of the heart the esophagus sits right underneath it and there's nothing in between and it's a beautiful view and the patient obviously because they're asleep they don't have to worry about having this huge probe stuck in their esophagus right and because you're closer to the organ you want to see being the heart the details can be fantastic because one of the other things with ultrasound is that the deeper you go the beam effectively fans out and gets thinner and thinner so you actually get less sort of detail on the edges whereas right in the center right underneath the probe is where your maximum amount of detail is gonna be so by having it right in the esophagus which is right beside the heart you're gonna get fantastic detail as important as the CT scanner was in trauma the ultrasound was actually the most important radiographic tool we had in trauma and that was the one thing that even the surgical residents needed to know how to do and it was called a fast ultrasound there was an algorithm for this because when a busy trauma center like Hopkins you're gonna see trauma so often penetrating trauma in particular where you have to know does this person need to go up to surgery is there fluid in the abdominal cavity that's generally one of the things you care about you certainly also care if there's fluid around the pericardium this non stretchy sac that surrounds the heart these are surgical emergencies especially fluid around the pericardium so I think sometime in our second year of residency we would go off and do this course where on pigs we would have to practice this over and over again until you learn the four places that you were looking for fluid inside the abdomen I guess we got pretty good at it I think I got OK at it but I I still always felt like a little nervous when push came to shove because

[00:48:19] I always felt like I wish I could go and spend a year just being an ultrasound tech to really really dial this in because the stakes are so high especially if you miss the slight amount of fluid in the pericardium that's a lethal injury and one of the real tricks as well is that depending on the composition of the fluid there's like frank blood or coagulating blood it can be really tricky to actually pick it out and so a lot of times you'd actually see the fast ultrasound would be done and if people weren't hundred percent confident that there's a problem or not a problem they'd go straight to CT scanning because you just couldn't make that error and that happens time and time again yeah and it's funny one of the last traumas I was ever involved in as a resident was just one of those cases where the patient came in and he was responsive he had the tiniest tiniest stab wound so less than a centimeter wide under the xiphoid that's it so this is a guy who walks in who has a sub centimeter sub xiphoid incision I mean it could've been a shaving cut but he's been stabbed and he's more or less seems pretty normal vital signs are more or less what you would expect when I lay him down and do this ultrasound of his heart it really looks like there's something there but I can't quite figure it out and now the question is well he's obviously too responsive to warrant cutting his chest open which was what you would do in the emergency situation so you have to do the CT scan but of course the risk in the CT scanner is as fast as the CT scanner is he is still laying down on a scanner potentially ready to have a cardiac arrest for at least a minute and a half and usually what would happen is

[00:50:01] I don't recall in this case but a lot of times if you're gonna go through the trouble of doing that you're gonna do a contrast CT scan as well you're not just gonna do what we would call a dry scan with no contrast so now you've got the fumbling around of getting the iodine machine hooked up to him etc etc and

[00:50:15] Eddie Cornwell who was the chairman of surgery at Hopkins he's now the chairman of surgery at Howard and just an incredible human being I remember one of the things that he told us when we were junior residence is beware of the patient who gets wildly anxious when you lay them down and sure enough when we go and lay this guy down in the scanner he just starts freaking out and when you sat him up he sort of calmed down a little bit it was do not pass go do not collect $200 and took him to the o.r opened him up immediately and sure enough that knife had actually hit his pulmonary vein and so that pulmonary vein was bleeding into his pericardium and so he would have had a cardiac tamponade if we left him on that table and amazingly that patient went home three days later yeah no exactly and you can see like the the power of the clinical skill as well as like just the basic imaging right the power of imaging plus clinical is pretty much where medicine is right now and how how we actually are able to diagnose things quickly and efficiently so we've talked about two technologies that most women are very familiar with when it comes to breast cancer which is of the cancers where screening is done visa vie imaging technology breast cancer is head and shoulders above the others in terms of the frequency and ubiquity of the scan so let's talk a little bit about because you've already explained what an ultrasound and an x-ray is so now explain what mammography is and why we would sometimes say mammography is sufficient versus insufficient then why do some women get told well you also need an ultrasound right so basically mammography is a lower attenuation x-ray we're actually taking x-ray but a weaker strength of it because we never have to penetrate bone and actually now it shines through the breast tissue which is all soft tissue and so one of the things that actually is maybe stepping back is to actually kind of look at breast tissue in particular so breast tissue is composed of normal subcutaneous tissue which is mainly fat and as well as glandular tissue and so when women are in their childbearing age it's almost all glandular tissue to produce milk for eventually feeding a baby and as women then go through menopause that glandular tissue can invariably involute so it's one of these things you don't use it it gets replaced with fat but in some women it actually doesn't get replaced with fat and that is what we call the dense breast tissue so mammograms are very very good at shining through fat and it actually allows you to see very very simple things like calcification in fact because they are just so dense and it acts just stands out whereas in glandular tissue sometimes that photon of low energy x-ray doesn't make it through and as a result the tissue is very very hard to see through and that's what we call the dense breast tissue and the reason it's hard to see through is because of all that glandular tissue that in some women over menopause or even older they just retain nobody really knows why they retain that extra glandular tissue why in some women it gets replaced with fat you know the women it doesn't we don't know why and so many states and I think they're actually over 38 and possibly soon to become a federal law in United States is going to require that the very first line on a mammogram report is going to be that the woman's breast tissue is dense limiting mammographic sensitivity or the breast tissue is almost entirely fat in which case mammograms are helpful because that actually will really allow women to determine was this test good enough and so for women who actually have dense breast tissue so they for some reason if they're postmenopausal or if they're pre menopausal in their childbearing age they still have a lot of glandular tissue that means a mammogram might not be enough and therefore they need another second imaging modality to look through the tissue and that's where altar sound comes in and as well as MRI would come in as well to be able to see through that dense glandular tissue that the mammogram can't see through now the last time I looked and these data could be they could just be simply dated but I think directionally this is right a mammogram had a sensitivity of about eighty call it eighty four eighty five percent and a specificity of about ninety ninety-one percent does that still sound about right to you it depends actually yeah that was like all comers was at the point I was going to make which is it becomes almost impossible to interpret what that means because what you need to know is what if

[00:54:24] I had a thousand women that looked exactly like the women I'm scanning right now exactly and so that's where it actually becomes really critical in the fact that depending on the breast density and that's why it's important for women to know what that is you're going to know how helpful a mammogram is or may not be but one of the other things that becomes actually very very powerful in the mammogram is to actually use comparison over time so that's why they recommend screening intervals of either one or two years and it's a matter of academic debate and because if you actually have like a mammogram taken and then let's say two years later you do another one it's actually far more sensitive to see that subtle change over time than it is to actually look at an individual mammogram on its own so a single mammogram on a dense woman it's sensitivity is about fifty five percent it's actually quite poor whereas on a woman who actually has fatty tissue it's very high how high it can actually be over ninety five percent so let me explain what sensitivity specificity means so that a person understands what this is about let's just use the numbers eighty and ninety because those are generally accepted as on aggregate so when we say a mammogram has an eighty percent sensitivity here's what we mean if there are a hundred woman who have cancer so there's a hundred women and we absolutely know that they have breast cancer and we subject them to a mammogram 80 of them will test positive 80 of them will have a true positive and 20 of them will test falsely negative so the sensitivity is the true positive rate over the true positives plus the false negatives correct exactly so the higher the sensitivity the less likely you are to take someone who has the cancer and miss them that's the juice on sensitivity let's now talk about specificity so mammography a moment ago you gave a staggeringly sad example so we'll come back to that but let's use the better one right let's say 90% so now what does it mean to have 90% specificity so that means you take a hundred women who we absolutely know do not have breast cancer and you scan them 90 of them will correctly identify as not having breast cancer 10 of them will incorrectly identify as having breast cancer so 10 will be false positives 90 will be true negatives so the sensitivity is the number of true negatives over the true negatives plus the false positives and so the example you gave a moment ago is if you'd have a woman whose breasts are very fatty not glandular therefore she's the poster child for mammography you're driving that specificity up which means you are reducing the number of false positives but in the example you gave earlier which is a woman who might have very very dense breast tissue imagine what it means to take a hundred women who have very very dense breast tissue and drive your specificity down to 50% that means on a given day half the women that walk into your clinic are going to be told they have cancer if they don't exactly so it's like flipping a coin and by the way one of the greatest examples of this

[00:57:40] I mean I attributed to Bob Kaplan but maybe he heard it somewhere else but I love it is you can make a test that is a hundred percent sensitive if you're willing to have 0% specificity and vice-versa for example you could send a letter you could have a little card that says you have cancer and you show it to every single person you meet you have a hundred percent sensitivity right right you will never have a false negative the problem is that so clinically useless because you have no specificity and similarly you could have a little magic card that you show everyone you ever meet for the rest of your life that says you do not have cancer guess what you have a 100 percent specific test it just has zero sensitivity so it's as useful as a warm bucket a hamster vomit and so it's this trade-off between sensitivity and specificity which I'm teeing this up because I know we're gonna come and talk about this when we get into the more advanced MRI stuff but the example of mammography is amazing to me because it makes you realize you can't just rely on one test especially when that test has such low sensitivity and specificity depending on the individual exactly and

[00:58:47] I think that that's the real important lesson is that it's actually very individually tailored right and so if you have one test and you don't know what your fingerprint or what the tissue that your breast is made of you really have no idea what you're looking for so you always need the one to kind of find out is this good enough people always talk about machine learning and

[00:59:05] AI and how it invariably it has to infiltrate medicine and it seems to me that one of the best places for it to do so is in at least comparative radiology so given the ubiquity of mammograms hopefully every woman above a certain age in the United States Canada is getting regular mammography there's no shortage of data are there companies out there that are working on basically doing that once you have a baseline which would be almost impossible for a machine to read but once you have that baseline longitudinally comparing it there are actually a lot of companies that are actually doing that and and even in some states that are actually using machine learning techniques to actually help the radiologist and actually can be used as even a second reader there are a number of companies working on that but it's not perfect what do you think that could improve the sensitivities and specificities of mammography - I mean can we get to the point where I don't know I mean most people would say you've got to be nor of 97 98 percent on both to really feel confident I think that's a pretty high target to achieve and the reason that would be is just because of the way the tests are done and the individual variability of people it's gonna be tough can't machine learning get that good it'll take a while it's gonna need volumes and volumes of data that's actually reproduced the exact same way and I think that's the biggest problem is because we're unique the way the breast is compressed the way everything is done when a mammogram is taken is somewhat different each time so the amount of coverage is a little bit different each time it's possible are we there yet no we're nowhere near close but we're getting better and that's also one of the challenges that we have when we look at the data on mammography is it so backwards looking and so if you want to look at the most comprehensive study of mammography and breast cancer screening by definition you are looking at a trial that was enrolling patients 15 to 20 years ago and therefore you have to be able to say well how relevant is the technology that was being used then relative to today and in the case of mammography it shouldn't be changing that much but I mean things do get better I mean we're reading pure digital now we have much better capacity to read even an x-ray than we did 20 years ago don't we we do and basically now what's actually happening is we're actually doing a fluoroscopic version of a mammogram we're basically sort of trying to slice through this 3-dimensional object and actually get the detail of it a three-dimensional layer whereas before the mammogram were typically just like the chest x-ray was done two different views compositing that three-dimensional picture together so that 3-dimensional view of the mammogram is actually better than it was now there's something else that I've never actually seen done clinically but I've read about it called

[01:01:47] MBI molecular breast imaging is that used any longer and what is it the reason it came across my radar was many years ago when I was just trying to get the landscape on ionizing radiation this came up as a test that was done as a follow-up to a mammogram but I I thought there must be a typo based on how much it had like something like 20 millisieverts of radiation and it was 40% of your annual radiation limit what that is now that's a functional tab so in the realm of nuclear medicine and so what that is doing is we're actually taking radioactive material and then we're actually injecting it into the body and so tissues that actually have increased mitochondria actually concentrate this radio tracer and so that typically happens in breast cancer so it's actually used with a radio tracer called system maybe you've heard of this maybe scan which is where we actually inject this into the heart and we actually look at whether or not the heart is being properly profused and so areas that aren't being perfused so therefore the muscle is not alive basically don't take up the radio tracer whereas muscle that is alive does take up the radio tracer and that muscle that's alive that's moving has a very high mitochondrial rate therefore it actually concentrates this material so breast cancer was actually doing very similar thing they'd actually have a high metabolism and so this tissue would actually concentrate or this greater trace were concentrated in that tissue so that was the mpi exam for breast is that test still done rarely but it can be done in women who actually have very very dense breast tissue and you actually need to see what's going on it can be done but a lot of it's actually been replaced with positron emission tomography scans so right now how many women young women we just say because the young women are gonna be more likely to have dense breast tissue do we have a sense of what percentage of them really are being uncovered meaning they're not getting adequate sort of surveillance with just mammography and would require at least ultrasound is that a third of women I mean we have a sense of what that number is depending on the jurisdiction so the guideline for when you actually start screening for a

[01:03:44] Mohammad Rafi can either be for the age of 40 and higher or 50 and higher each jurisdiction is a little bit different so what that means is that basically anybody under the age of 40 unless you have a family history of somebody or having breast cancer an early age they're not getting screened at all so everything we've talked about from a technology standpoint in some ways pales in comparison to what we're about to talk about which is about as complicated a set of physics as you're gonna find within the walls of a hospital right I mean it doesn't get a lot more complicated than an MRI does it no it doesn't it's really an engineer to like yeah and I certainly again thinking back to my brief six weeks of doing radiology

[01:04:21] I feel like more of my notes were scribbling down an explanation of how this thing worked thing else so let's go back to the beginning who the heck thought of this they're actually three people actually thought about it but the Mansfield is actually one of the main creators of it in UK and so the MRI machine really it's actually quite the amazing tool and it actually wasn't initially developed for imaging it was actually just so developed on a bench top where they're actually just kind of looking to see what the effect of electromagnetic waves does to anything and somebody wind up sticking tissue in it saying hey look it's like we can actually what goes in one side comes out a little bit differently on the other side and as a result we can actually determine what that composition of material was so does that mean like the NMR that we were looking at when we did organic chemistry was really the precursor to the MRI that we're sitting outside of right now listening to at home it's the exact same device that NMR basically is just a two dimensional version of MRI which is three dimensions because our brain likes three dimensions so let's go back to organic chemistry so again we'll link to a picture of an NMR spectra talking about padai I guess there's also no easy way around this right I think you have to sort of roll your sleeves up a little bit on physics to understand how an MRI works there is no I'm sure there's a kids book out there waiting to be written on the topic which would be amazing but it's pretty tough so you take a molecule like alcohol okay so it's got these two carbons that are joined the first carbon has three hydrogen's around it the next carbon has a hydrogen and a hydrogen but then instead of the third hydrogen it gets an oxygen which is bound to a hydrogen that is the stuff that people drink and get drunk on now put that into a nuclear magnetic resonance machine and you're gonna see different Peaks right it's going to show you that there is a methyl group somewhere it's gonna say it can't tell you what it sees but it tells you that there's a carbon bound to three hydrogen's right right how does it do that perhaps I might actually take up the challenge of a children's book problem is I just like writing but maybe for children I'll be okay the way it actually does it is actually quite fascinating and it's actually relatively simple so what it actually does is the hydrogen in particular so we're gonna sort of fixate on hydrogen because that's the atom that we're really interested in and

[01:06:51] I'm just gonna say one thing because you're gonna do this anyway and I just want to preface it you're gonna use hydrogen and proton interchangeably aren't you I will can you just tell someone why you're gonna use hydrogen and a proton interchangeably sure so the atom basically of that hydrogen is you have one proton and one electron and in the hydrogen proton we don't really care about the electron it just sort of disappears so the hydrogen

[01:07:13] I guess nucleus is a proton and it has no Neutron its mass is 1 its mass is determined by the one and only proton it carries correct exactly okay so now hydrogen and proton they're the same thing for the purpose of this discussion exactly so when we look at the NMR so we actually have hydrogen bound to an oxygen or hydrogen bound to a carbon and so the behavior of that nucleus is going to be a little different so there's basically a magnet that's creating a field and somehow through that we can see how the hydrogen is bonded to either the oxygen or the carbon in the ethanol molecule right so we were talking about the NMR and so what the NMR does is that it really is a hydrogen or proton imager or actually just detector and so the way the magnetic field of hydrogen behaves if it's attached to either the oxygen and OAH of alcohol or the ch3 of a carbon is completely different it actually gives off a different wavelength and so as a result that's how we're actually able to get this what we call NMR spectra and so what happened is that from there there's a person named damadian who many consider to be the father of MRI he actually said well you know look if we can actually take what men's field a lot ober did on a bench top can we actually put a human in it and actually start to see the soft tissue because we know that our bodies composed of roughly 70% water there's a lot of hydrogen on fat's so can we see that frequency difference we can see it on a bench top but what about in people so we have more hydrogen in us if we were just going to count up the atoms and as hydrogen wins all day long because as you said it for 70% of water that's two to one hydrogen over oxygen there and then all the fat that's in us is all the hydrogen - the carbon there and there's basically hydrogen in protein as well I mean so if you have a hydrogen detector that's basically the way you would describe an

[01:09:06] MRI and MRI is exactly that it's a hydrogen imager so basically we're looking at hydrogen nuclei which is a proton and so a lot of times as well people actually talk about proton spectroscopy which is NMR and MRI is just basically a simple hydrogen imager so I think anyone who's had an MRI knows that there's a magnet involved and it's generally a non-trivial magnet some people have probably heard of some of these real horror stories where accidentally in the hospital a patient's wheeled in and there's a loose oxygen tank under the gurney that's willing them in and it goes flying across the room and hit somebody and can kill someone so how strong is the magnet and why does it need to be so strong right so the magnets they come in different flavors so typically it's regarded as a

[01:09:50] Tesla and so Tesla is roughly 10,000 ghosts and so a Gauss is effectively what the North Pole can produce and it's actually the typical measurement for most magnets but when we actually into the MRI field it becomes so much stronger and the reason we actually kind of need that high Tesla field strength is because we're actually taking hydrogen which is typically not that magnetic compared to like a magnet that we think about like a bar magnet and what we're trying to do is they're actually trying to orient that little dipole of the water molecule or fat molecule a certain direction and that's what this static field does and that's why it has to be so strong so they come in flavors 1.5 tesla 3 Tesla which is double the strength 7 Tesla and so the higher the Tesla they go the more it's actually able to pull all of the hydrogen's in orient them in one direction because as we're sitting here or anywhere normally our hydrogen molecules are on water we're just kind of bouncing around randomly kind of pointing at any which direction and that there is no kind of magnetic component to us the hydrogen's one are spinning around just based on Brownian motion and so when you actually go into a magnet that strong magnetic field these hydrogen's basically kind of turn and orient themselves in that direction and so that's what actually provides the initial basis for an MRI and that's why contrary to what we see on TV that magnet is always on you can never turn it off because that magnetic field always has to be there in order to provide that orientation and as well the way it works is you actually have a superconducting wire that's actually running just above absolute zero degrees

[01:11:26] Kelvin so it's roughly 2 Kelvin and so you can't turn that off this is superconducting wire it has like pumps that are pumping all the time to keep it that cold so that when you actually put an electric field in like a loop of wire that electric field is what actually generates the magnetic field in a perpendicular direction so you have a generator that backs up if you lose power which invariably you're gonna lose at some point exactly you have to have that backup power to always keep this pump moving this liquid helium that's surrounding the wires to always keep that liquid helium floating around circulating around that wire to keep that water in your absolute zero Kelvin now if we were to walk in the scanner today and everyone can sort of picture this there's a bed running through a doughnut what is the direction right now that that magnet is being oriented the doughnut so that's where that loop of superconducting wire is sitting in and so depending on how it's put in most of the time the north will actually face away from the control center and that's the direction of North got it and if I recall there's like a right-hand rule on this isn't there there is very nice so I can tell you which way the power and the coil is going it's actually going I guess if you're looking from the foot of the bed it's actually going in a clockwise circle and that's that the right hand the right hand rule it's pointing in the axis okay now aside from the fact let's pretend we weren't wearing anything metal if you walked into a room where there was a 10 or a 20

[01:12:48] Tesla magnet what did you feel anything and would it do anything to you that is harmful the action magnetic field won't do that much now when you get very very strong to a moving magnetic field you can actually start to feel it because it can actually trigger your nerve impulses to start moving so sometimes people actually if the magnetic field is too strong they'll actually get twitching and sometimes people who are actually around magnets all the time actually become more and more attuned to this type of a thing and so if you have MRI technologists or people who are working with the high fields all the time they can say you know when I go to the the head of the magnet or like the north side I actually kind of feel something pulling a neck sometimes people describe getting temporary headaches and as soon as they step away from the field it all goes away usually when patients ask me if or any side effects or harm of an MRI I mean our lib answer is to say no no no no especially with a non-contrast like if there's I mean not that the risk of gadolinium is high but if you're just having a dry MRI you say nothing nothing nothing but I actually had a patient who had very very very severe migraine headaches and she actually had a migraine triggered by an MRI and I truly believe that wasn't just a coincidence I mean I think her headaches were so severe so so I now sort of always couch my response as there's virtually no short-term or long-term consequence that can come from an MRI but at least in the case of that person you could trigger a headache you can because what it does is it can actually stimulate the nervous response and depending on how strong the field is so for example if you were to do a 7

[01:14:17] Tesla magnet you're definitely going to notice it and as a result I'll tell people look you can't be in this too long because of the fact that you're actually gonna stimulate so I remember going back to learning about this one of the other things that sort of strikes anybody who's had an MRI is they take a long time so why is it that if you wanted to get an MRI let's never mind whole body which we'll come to but you just want to get an MRI of the abdomen that could easily take 40 minutes whereas a CT scan of the abdomen can take two minutes yeah and it's basically the way the images are acquired two completely different mechanism so if we go back and talk about the x-ray it's based like a single flash we're actually looking through everything the CT is basically this x-ray that's constantly on spinning around and basically sort of circulating around you whereas MRI behaves completely differently and during the period of time of that acquisition what it's doing is everything that's inside the center of that doughnut is being pulled in a certain direction all the hydrogen's on your water and fat and then the loud part of the MRI is actually a temporary magnetic field which is countering that static field and so it's actually now pulling all the hydrogen's in the opposite direction and then in that opposite direction it actually turns off and then the hydrogen's reorient to where they were in that static field and as they reorient they actually give off a different frequency and that different frequency takes together and that's what we call the TR or repetition time or the TE of the equity and that you can't screw down so let's talk about TR and TE because it's the TR and the TE that determine what sequence you are looking at so again I think the average person probably won't recognize these terms but certainly anyone in the medical profession will know the difference between a t1-weighted versus a t2-weighted image versus a spin versus and echo versus all of these things so let's just talk about the difference between TR that repetition pulse time and then TE is TE the time it takes or to relax back to its original position so just discussing

[01:16:17] TR and TE how do they differ in acquiring a t1-weighted image which is the one that's really anatomically beautiful it's the closest thing you see to Wow I know what I'm looking at it and I'm not a radiologist versus the t2-weighted image which seems to highlight water more so things that are water look more white but it doesn't have the anatomic resolution how do would you differentiate those right so the simplest thing to do in and it's actually quite fascinating is I went through residency people are always sort of stunned with is this a t1 image or a t2 image and the points are all that and was kind of like sort of a bit obscure and then when I started to do MRI much more it's like it became actually pretty simple on the t1 image we actually see nothing but fat so fat gives a lot of signal which is what makes it nice and bright so we see a single element or I guess a single element that the hydrogen would be bonded to that we're looking at whereas a t2 we're actually now seeing two elements we're seeing fat and water and so those two elements are actually coming off at different frequencies from the MRI machine and you have to wait a longer echo time to be able to pick up the water because it returns back to normal much more slowly than the fat does so that's our TV t2-weighted images take longer to acquire because the t e is long because you have to wait to get both fat and water what's the difference in the TR between the t1 and t2 it's all going to be entirely dependent on the machine so you actually have to customize those parameters for every single machine and so that actually kind of takes a while to actually kind of go and calibrate and kind of get used to what your eyes used to seeing and it's also going to be dependent on the signal the overall magnetic field as was overall signal-to-noise for that coil set that you're using so each one has to be effectively tuned and then what does it mean when you have these other things that come out and got it's been so long since I've done it that I don't even remember when we would look at spin spin echo Flair all of these I vaguely remember all of these other sequences we would order I don't actually recall what they were give us a brief rundown of that one of the things that MRI absolutely loves it's just the different acronyms for everything it's much you got to have it it's almost like a whoever can come up with the coolest acronym wins like lava and all these other things but effectively there's three main categories of MRI sequencing one is what we'll call conventional so conventional spin echo and so that's basically just waiting as long as you can for the hydrogen to completely relax and give off both its water and fat signal and then we have what's called gradient imaging and so that's actually you're not waiting for it to completely return back to normal but somewhere in the middle you're actually kind of repulsing again so you're basically hearing that noise of the machine turning back on and saying you know we're not gonna wait to a completely relaxed we're gonna fire up again and just give us a sense of the actual time how many milliseconds if you're trying to get a t2 signal and you're waiting for that full relaxation how many milliseconds is that directionally it's actually gonna be it can be up as high as like 60 milliseconds okay even longer for some of them okay and when you do these gradient based tests where you're gonna repulse how quickly are you repulsing you can actually repulse in like two milliseconds or even faster and then there's actually the third category which is actually called epi or echo planar imaging and this is actually amazing so this part actually allows you not just to be looking at a single slice of a person but you're actually going and you're actually now running multiple slices simultaneously where you're actually putting two different fields on the person at the same time and so as a result and it kind of gets complicated because we use the word gradient all the time and so what a gradient basically means it's factors like a ramp from a low number to a high number and so if I was kind of looking at you and I said I said we're gonna start the image from your top down first we're going to put a gradient on from top to bottom so it's going to be a little bit of a higher frequency at the top a little bit of a lower frequency lower down and then we're actually also going to look at phase from right to left and depending on how your body is oriented and where the blood flow is going to be we're going to look at a phase and frequency which now bring us into the realm of a Fourier transform so these are now with the pulses we're effectively looking at all these repetitive sine waves and we're actually plotting that in frequency and phase domain right and for the listener we always talk that Laplace was only half the man Fourier was that's like the nerdiest math joke I'm gonna tell today all kidding aside how does one get into

[01:20:50] MRI radiology without a background in mathematics and physics it seems it would be impossible it's a struggle I can actually remember with a group of residents that I was with training and great people that we actually had a physicist come in and was talking about MRI physics for a couple of days and trying to teach us all in I thought boy this guy's really watering it down I can barely hang on to what this guy's saying then I kind of looked and talked to all my colleagues and they were just being welder they had no idea what he was talking about because as far as an engineer is concerned it's like Fourier domain it's kind of like that's from like the alphabet yeah that's our bread and butter back from the day yeah the difference with the MRI is that you start in this four-year domain and because we're a three dimensional object when you're looking at a two-dimensional plane that's the Fourier transform when you now add that third dimension it becomes what we call K space so it's effectively a two dimensional fourier transform which is what the MRI world operates on it's called K space so what we're gonna do in the shownotes here is we're going to link to some very common types of MRIs that people have right the most common ones that people have is you've tweaked your knee you're gonna get the knee MRI you've hurt your back you're gonna get the MRI of your back you're having headaches they're gonna do the MRI of the head those sorts of things so when you think about the bread-and-butter clinical practice of medicine what types of MRIs describe what those three would be what sequences would be run - if you wanted to evaluate someone's ACL the ligament in the knee what are you going to look at the first thing you're gonna do is this sort of relates back to the plain x-ray you're always gonna look at things in two dimensions you're gonna look at two planes and in this case and so you'll be slicing from right to left top to bottom side to side and the beauty of the MRI is that based on how you orient your gradients you can easily slice those three directions or actually in any direction you want which is why we call it multiplanar and so if we were to look at a simple thing like a simple image like an e so we always like our

[01:22:42] Anatomy image so that's our plane t1 because fat is beautiful and it actually allows us to see everything really well and it looks like what we're actually accustomed to seeing and so we do a t1 sequence and would also look at a t2 sequence or a t2 fat's at sequence and what that actually allows us to do is on a t2 fat's at we actually go matte so that's fat saturation yeah so a t2 fat saturation what we're doing is we're taking t2 so now we're t2 looks at two things so fat and water and then we actually suppress the fat so really all we're seeing is water and why that's most interesting is because edema so when there's something going wrong in the body almost anywhere edema happens it's like if you bang your hand and it swells up that swelling is edema you injure your knee it swells up that's edema and so if you actually bang the bones on your knees so you've actually injured the cartilage you're gonna get edema happening in the ends of the bone as well as in the cartilage so that's why the t2 with saturation or removing the fat signal becomes so powerful because it effectively now turns into a edema imager and when we know when there's edema there's a problem and that's kind of a simple concept in MRI that is quite often lost but it's very very important and then when you look at somebody's brain for example we just reviewed my MRI recently so one thing that stands out I think is the exquisite and atomic detail you're getting that seems to look far better than a dozen CT scan and secondly it's the fact that without any contrast you're able to see as though you did an angiogram on all the vessels in my brain now is that something that any MRI can do or is that just something that the MRI here can do most MRIs should be able to do that and so when we cancer think back to what an

[01:24:27] MRI is again how imager but it's also a big powerful magnet and so what makes our blood red is actually the iron that's contained within it so what you can actually do is you can take all the blood that's let's say flowing to a particular organ like the head so anything that's flowing up and you say okay I'm gonna actually excite anything going up north to the brain and so therefore that's arteries and so then you'll actually get to see all the exquisite arteries in your brain just by exciting that blood I had never realized something so obvious as you just said it but that's one part of the body where it's really easy I mean the limbs would be the same we're directionally it's so clear you know which way your magnet is oriented you know which way is blood flow away from the heart and you've got this beautiful iron floating around in water right that's one of the beauties of MRI it's that there's all these different things that you can actually add to it and so not only that you can actually excite anything flowing in one direction but you can actually also pick off the frequency that's different between oxygenated arterial blood and deoxygenated venous blood and so that comes into a different sequence called

[01:25:35] SWI or susceptibility weighted imaging where you can actually look at the deoxygenation status of venous blood and you can get spectacular contrast for the small blood vessels in the brain using that sequence I remember the first time you did an MRI of my head I don't know why I was more nervous about seeing that than anything else because we sort of remember the most extreme horrible stories but I mean I know people who have died of aneurysms you and I were even speaking about a patient a few hours ago about this I used to ride a bike with a guy who was maybe six years 7 years older than me and was at

[01:26:11] Disneyland one day with his kids and had a horrible headache and drop dead and he had an aneurysm which is congenital and so yeah I was sort of like really nervous even though I realized straight probability bases the odds were quite low they weren't zero and I figured well it's better to find this now because you can treat these things electively quite easily but once they rupture the mortality is incredibly high the mortality of a ruptured aneurysm is over 93 to 95 percent so most people don't make it whereas when you do find them earlier all sorts of options such as quarreling where you can actually treat it or clipping and so that's actually one of the real powers of being able to kind of see what's going on without any injection or anything like that you can see the exquisite detail of the arteries and if there is a problem and we found a fair number of people with them you can actually save their lives what is the frequency admittedly you have a you could argue a somewhat biased population because they're more health-conscious obviously anyone who can afford to just pay for an MRI out of pocket is gonna have a socio-economic advantage but but if you argued that that's still a reasonable cross-section of the population from a genetic standpoint which is what we're basically asking what is the prevalence you find of aneurysm in the brain so when we actually scanned a thousand people we actually found eight intracranial brain aneurysms so point eight percent that's higher than I would have guessed does the literature support that the literature is actually a little bit less and the question is is that because you don't find them because basically people have passed away and we don't know what happens to the elderly because if they pass away it's natural causes yeah we're not doing the autopsies now there are other aneurysms that are not quite as lethal but are really bad and the two that I remember from residency were splenic artery aneurysms and popliteal artery aneurysms do you see those and if so at what frequency we found only think two splenic artery aneurysms but they are particularly deadly and now the popliteal arteries haven't seen many of those don't haven't seen those and then those should be actually easier you can palpate those on a thin enough individual I was gonna say those are actually easier to feel into to see and to look at but we actually haven't found any of those I'm kind of still shocked that's a frightening statistic garage that to think that almost 1% of the population has an aneurysm in their brain and one of the things that we actually find though and this may be showing the genetic component to it is that when you find it in one person in the family next thing you know all their extended families coming in right they want to know what's going on we looked into this three years ago I have a patient a young woman probably in her late thirties her mother died very young when she was very young the patient was very young and the mother herself was quite young from an aneurysm it was not in the brain but I'll for the sake of trying to protect her confidentiality

[01:28:54] I'll refrain from saying what part of the body it was and then when we dug in her family history further we found another person who had died of an aneurysm and yet a different part of the body so not a or t'k where you normally see that linked to atherosclerosis put a different major vessel and our team did a bit of work on this and actually found evidence that there really was potentially a genetic component here and so we petitioned her insurance company to pay for an MRA the magnetic resonance angiography which is basically what we're talking about here and they declined it which really irked me and we fought with her insurance company for her six months to get this paid and they denied it and they denied it and they denied it and finally the woman just paid out of pocket for it and I was blown away at how much it cost do you want to take a guess at how much it cost to get an MRA in the United States I've seen some interesting pricing there's nine thousand dollars

[01:29:48] Wow Wow that's unbelievable yeah and it was negative so we were happy and she was obviously fortunate enough to be able to afford that but it upset me that we couldn't make a case to the insurance company that two people won first degree one second degree related to this woman have died from an aneurysm young and they were like yep that's cool well that's a tragedy that's so let's come back to now what you do here ROG cuz I've been around a lot of MRI and if we bring this story back full circle four years ago or whenever we were introduced the question that was asked at me was hey is this thing kind of cool or what and I came up here and I spent a full day with you and I thought yeah boy this is really cool but so many things that you were doing just seemed counter to what we were seeing in the Big Shot hospitals and for starters you were using a puny magnet right so one of the things hospitals love to brag about is the size of their magnet right I'm gonna just try nothing name any hospitals and offend everybody but you know pick your favorite institution we've got the newest for Tesla magnet I probably was in the top five questions I asked you oh so what size magnet are you're using and you said we're using a one point five Tesla magnet and I said well that's interesting that seems a little bit JV so explain why you use a magnet that is not at the peak of what you're capable of just from a technology standpoint well it really started depends on like basically how you tune a magnet so actually kind of your magnet is very much like a smartphone if you actually build the right hardware you can actually really get it to sing and do an amazing job and so with a three-team magnet one of the things is you can get some pretty exquisite imaging as we see quite commonly and really there's a lot of bragging rights associated with it we're not much of braggers up here we just actually want to do you the best imaging we can and actually tune the machine as optimally as possible so with a three Tesla magnet one of the things that actually commonly happens is that when you look at the wavelength of a 3

[01:31:49] Tesla because remember it's electromagnetic fields actually go hand in hand and those are actually wavelengths and so the 3 Tesla wavelength is roughly 15 centimeters so it's the width of your head 1.5 is roughly 30 centimeters so it's the width of mostly players shoulders so as a result you actually start to get a lot more penetration with a lower field magnet and so that way you're actually able to see things quite well when you're particularly having everything tuned to that particular wavelength and quite commonly when people are purchasing machines they just don't know the physics of how the static magnetic field the gradient magnetic fields the coils and there's roughly about a hundred and fifty parameters per t1 t2 that saturation sequence that you can actually adjust to make it work the way you need it and most of the time what commonly happens almost everywhere is that you'll have the vendor will actually come in and set the standard parameters and from there on it's kind of like let's make it as simple as possible push a button and that's kind of not what I do we don't want to just push buttons we actually want to understand how it all works how it can be optimized to the person that's coming in and now the entire system from front to back is optimized so we're maximizing our signal-to-noise and when you maximize your signal-to-noise that's when you actually really get a lot of speed and detail and then that's where one of the real values of being able to talk engineering or physics with the MRI physicist and also then put on your clinical and kind of saying well this is what I want to see there's a level of detail I need a level of resolution that you can really tune the machine to where you want it to be to me of course that was the analogy he came up with the first one that jumps to my mind is looking at sort of the heyday of f1 in the late 80s and early 90s when the cars had become monsters so if you look at the McLaren mp4 4 which is regarded as either the greatest or a second greatest Formula

[01:33:43] One car in history the only other car that could probably rival it would be the 1993 Williams it had a 1.5 liter engine so for any gearhead listening that's a really tiny engine like your Prius probably has a bigger engine than a 1.5 liter engine and yet it produced 1200 horsepower redlining at something like 15,000 rpm and I just remember being a boy being so obsessed with that like how could that possibly happen and

[01:34:12] I remember looking at my dad's station wagon which had like a 5 liter chevy block in it and thinking how is this thing so inferior but in the end like you can engineer I mean I think the technical term is you can engineer this out of anything right that would be exactly and that's exactly what it is and it's very analogous to the Formula one and a lot of people kind of they're more into their bragging rights it was like the bigger the bigger the bigger it's not always bigger it's kind of like you really understand what you're doing and want to get underneath the hood you can take that 1.5 liter engine you can put the turbochargers on it you can put you know like the multiple valves and the everything took actually get to torque and horsepower you want out of it but most people don't think that way they think bigger is better how did you do all this tinkering because you basically have here in Vancouver a piece of hardware that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world and you've layered on top of that software that is now also in a league of its own and that's even more complicated I just am interested in this hardware I mean one of the things that I send a number of patients here and usually the first question I ask is why are you sending me to Vancouver like I live in fill-in-the-blank some city in the United States we do everything the best there's no way you're telling me there's an MRI in

[01:35:31] Vancouver if I I told my parents the other day I was coming to Vancouver to get the MRI and they live you could almost hear them look at me through the phone like why are you coming to Canada so I mean not to toot your horn too much but you're doing something very different ROG so how did you go through this process of tinkering with the hundred and fifty variables at your disposal to come up with this super custom pimped-out hardware that doesn't resemble anything else on the planet so part of it is it's like the the biggest problem with me is that I'm an engineer in medicine and so when I kind of go through it's like I say well what do I want to know what I want to see and how do I make it work and so I kind of started sort of the back end and say okay what I want to know is exactly what's going on everywhere in the body and what are the different sequences that are going to get me there and then

[01:36:24] I kind of work backwards and then this is where you put your engineering or physics hat on and you actually wind up starting to talk to like the MRI physicists who are there's a plethora of them there are almost everywhere and they love to talk to doctors but just most the time doctors can't talk to them or vice versa and that's when you start to really kind of get under the hood and really kind of understand how to make this work and then you travel around to different academic centers or different places and you wind up spending time with the people who actually really understand the hardware and those are mainly the physicists very similar to a mechanic it's like if you want to figure out how to make your five liter behave like a thousand horsepower you talk to the mechanics who know how to do it don't try it yourself right they've already been there they've seen it they've worked on things forever and that's actually how a lot of it happens and so we would actually be having some of the top MRI physicists sort of saying hey Raj can you test us we wrote this sequence and the sequence is basically like a filter like a t1 or a t2 or a fat saturation can you try it out and kind of see how it works so we go and try it out usually me as a subject because I also know what I'm looking for and then we'd have a feedback loop one or two of my MRI technologist here who would actually you sort of push the buttons and run the machine and we'd see what it would give me and I knew from all the other imaging training that I would of what I would be looking for so I put my nuclear medicine hat on and say okay from a functional point of view this is what I want to see then I put my radiology hat and say this is what I want to see from an imaging perspective and let's define that a little bit

[01:37:54] I mean objective is important so when you went about this process what were you optimizing for were you interested primarily in detection of cancer or what was the problem you wanted to solve clinically the first thing I wanted to do is so when we talk about the nuclear medicine so when we're injecting somebody's radioactivity we want to basically optimize that dose that we're giving to somebody so that means we want to cover everything from head to foot we don't want to just look at an individual body part and we want to see how it all works then we go to radiology typically we're just doing a snapshot of an individual part like a head or a neck or a torso and so I kind of thought well all these MRI machines that are out there all they're doing is looking at individual body parts and I thought if I customize this hardware with a few things that might allow me to move people around while they're on the table while they're laying there well I may be be able to connect the head with the neck with the chest with the abdomen and so actually when I bought the hardware myself I kind of put together probably about 50 options that the vendors kind of said you're crazy we've never seen any of this stuff just with the thought that you know I think this might work this is where I was kind of looking at all the different options and kind of knew what they could possibly do and I thought if I build this hardware this this way will it work and it was a complete guess but an educated guess and then once I put that hardware together then we started to test and test and did more and more then we would start talking to more physicists the vendors themselves actually have a lot of good resources with very technologically capable people and when I started to put this together then I kind of thought okay what would I want if I'm a patient what would I want to know well number one and want to know that my brains okay

[01:39:35] I'd want to know that the arteries in my brain are okay they're not going to rupture and then I basically want to say whenever I go into any test or anybody goes into the doctor and gets any kind of imaging tests of any kind the first question of their mind is do I have cancer yes or no and in nuclear medicine most of the tests are binary we can actually answer that with a yes or no in radiology it's not so clear it's kind of like maybe and you're actually kind of playing more statistics like probably not and I thought how do I marry these two together and this is where an MRI becomes a beautiful machine and the fact that it actually allows you to take that yes or no binary answer of functional nuclear medicine and combine it with the anatomic localization and understanding of tissue types that radiology has and so I merge those two together on the one machine and what is the functional arm that you've brought into it yeah so the functional arm is actually an area that's actually growing a lot in academia it's actually called DWI or dweebs which stands for diffusion-weighted imaging with background subtraction and so what we're doing with dweebs is that we're actually looking at water at two points in time and so we're actually looking at it within about 60 microseconds of water motion and so by doing that what happens that you first look at water at one point in time and then you look at it at the second point in time and if it hasn't moved it's because it's not allowed to move it's effectively trapped between walls and so that could be because of the fact there's a tight cell membrane or it could be because components of a cell are preventing that water from moving what's the time gap between those two samples six microseconds Wow and so when you see that something isn't moving when you see that water is being forced to be stationary as opposed to moving according to the stochastic prediction you have what do you infer clinically about that tissue so as soon as you start to see that water's being prevented from moving that means that that there's basically going to be a high density of cells they're so big cluster of cells and so it's very much like I actually call it the lump detector so it's basically like you they tell women for breast cancer feel for a lump and basically when you're feeling for a lump that's hard spot and so the reason it's hard is because you have this increased cellular density and so with that increased cell your density that's where water is restricted from moving and that's what DWI or diffusion-weighted imaging does and then why it's called DWI is because the ficks law of diffusion basically means that the normal diffusion of water allowing to move a lot is being completely restricted and it just doesn't have the ability to move you know I usually tell patients about this part of the MRI telling though something that I think many people outside of medicine would find surprising when you do what's called a laparotomy when you open up a person's abdomen and let's say they have colon cancer so the the colonoscopy has confirmed that of course you have a biopsy so now you're going in to do an operation to remove their colon but you still have another step along the way which is you have to complete what's called staging you have to ask the question has this cancer spread so usually the first thing you're doing is you're running your hand along parts of the abdomen you can't even visualize the entire surface of the liver even behind the liver or something you won't see it's actually unmistakable what cancer feels like because it is so in contrast to what normal tissue feels like and even the colon before you cut it out if you just reach in and pick up a piece of the ascending colon it's not remotely subtle where the cancer is it's entirely obvious just based on the firmness of the tissue and even when I talked to surgeons who operate on parts of the body that I didn't operate on such as the prostate or things like that it's the same thing and example you give with breast is perfect and so it really is this amazing ability to pair exquisite anatomic detail at resolutions that we'll discuss but basically now approaching one by one by one millimeter resolution anatomically with now this functional property of firmness is that an accurate statement it definitely is so we're actually combining the anatomic and functional and that's where just like then PET CT where that famous 1+1 equals 3 is exactly what we're doing and the beauty of it is there's absolutely no radiation so there's no risk so the risk it seems because one of the things

[01:43:47] I do explain to patients is who should consider doing this right and my view with cancer screening is just just a very personalized decision I don't think it is for everybody to do the kind of stuff that I do or that a number of my patients you've now scanned have done over the past three or four years and when people say is there a harm of doing this outside of the probably rare rare event of getting a migraine headache triggered by the magnet I say there is a harm the harm of a false positive the harm is that we see something that turns out in the long run to not be cancer but in the process of going down the advanced diagnostic pathway to get there you are either physically harmed by something we do subsequently for example another biopsy or a biopsy or a subsequent biopsy and of course the emotional toll it takes on you to see a shadow in this part of your body and have to sit there and have a discussion about what it could be what it's probably a cyst but it might be a tumor we probably need to do follow I mean to me this gets back to where we were a while ago on the discussion of sensitivity and specificity right so if somebody came along and said I have a test that is a hundred percent sensitive but only 50 percent specific I'd throw it in the wastebasket I mean it would serve virtually no purpose for reasons I could walk the listener through in terms of positive and predictive value they get a pretty good value so when you think about the sensitivity and specificity of the technology that you've developed here which again we haven't even really done just as to getting into we've talked a little bit about the hardware we haven't even got to the software I'd love to talk about that a little bit do you think about sensitivity and specificity by tissue type by cancer type how do you in your mind wrap your head around that so typically the way I kind of look at is really almost organ by organ when we're actually kind of going through for example in the liver basically the simple thing we want to kind of know is there a problem yes or no like really that's the simplicity that the average person and I put myself in that category wants to know do I have a problem to worry about and that's where I kind of say by combining this functional as well as an anatomic imaging together we're actually really able to nail that down so in our a thousand people that we did the fascinating thing about this is all these people who actually followed them up and actually talked to them and kind of found out what happened and so we actually had two false positives so these were two people where we kind of thought okay there's a problem here that you need to get addressed further by their further imaging and see what's going on and of those two false positives one was a male with asymmetric breast tissue so we actually just had one-sided breast tissue we didn't know what it was it's like so meaning you he came out of the MRI and you believed he had breast cancer which most listeners might think is odd but it turns out men can get breast cancer it's just virtually in exceedingly rare exactly that's basically the DWI showed a difference in density between one breast and the other yeah that's where like why is that most of time when men actually have kind of camasta or that breast tissue it's usually bilateral because it's hormonal but to have unilateral is somewhat hot and so as a result we sent this person to an ultrasound which is a commonly done and they too had no idea and so they actually also made the call to biopsy and it came back as normal breast glandular tissue in a male so let's talk just about the harm there so emotionally that man probably spent the series of know if it was in Canada a year if it was in the United States a week being stressed out about this or I just can't help but take digs at your health care system as you take digs at ours no I'm totally teasing so there's a legitimate emotional strain here which I don't think anybody who's known someone who's gone through that or who come through that themselves you just can't deny this and I've not lived it personally but I've seen it and it's it's very difficult and then secondly he had to get a procedure had to get a needle stuck into his breast tissue and look that's on the scale of procedures that's still pretty minor but it's not trivial so what was the second case and so the second case was actually a woman who basically had a seatbelt injury to her breast and actually wound up having unusual scar that has actually trapped fluid in it and so this person actually should have but never did actually have any mammograms because that would have led to the same conclusion though we don't know what this is so that was the second case where it's kind of like there's something unusual going on this breast we don't know what it is but we didn't actually have any proper history from her and so we sold was she she would have been late 50s a woman in her late 50s had never had a mammogram surprise it's out there even in Canada even in

[01:48:18] Canada yeah paedon of itself is very hard to believe in a country where it's free yeah yeah and then what would bring that patient in to get a whole body MRI the person actually kind of felt that I just want to know where I'm at and you know it's like I don't believe in the radiation from a mongrel and I keep trying to tell them look it's so minimal that the benefit outweighs the risks but they're like I want the MRI instead because number one patients kind of know that it's the most detailed exam you can get and as well there's no radiation so we actually had the patient and it's kind of like yes there's this I don't you know what this is going on here so we set them off to a facility that does nothing but women's imaging and they too didn't know what it was and so they stuck a needle in it and it actually came back as uh trying something fibrous zach was actually trapped scar tissue and at that point when we'd spoken to a woman afterwards were like did you ever have trauma like why would you have scar to that area it's like oh yeah I was in a bad car accident and that was it it was a seat belt scar those are two pretty interesting false negatives right both breasts men women I would have always maybe guessed or been most concerned about the false positives that occur deeper in the body I always tell patients the call I'm always most afraid of getting is the little shadow in the pancreas where you just don't know is this in add no carcinoma of the pancreas which of course is something that if you're lucky you can resect it and if you're even luckier you can survive it and I guess that's the only shot you're gonna have at surviving pancreatic cancer as an incidental finding really don't think anybody that presents with pancreatic cancer is going to survive it at least not as an adenocarcinoma but then you worry about well what if it's something that turns out not to be cancer and you hear these horror stories there's a very famous one I believe at

[01:50:00] Stanford several years ago where a woman went to a sort of drive-by CT clinic got a CT scan showed something in the pancreas she ended up going to get a biopsy and I believe it was an ERCP I did biopsy one complication led to another led to another she died of sepsis and by the way it turned out she didn't have pancreatic cancer

[01:50:20] I don't know that firsthand so that might be a bit of a wives tale stretch but certainly that's a very popular story in the Bay Area but it's the cautionary tale right definitely it is and that's kind of where the real value of actually having MRI as opposed to CT comes in in the fact that when we're looking at organs particularly the pancreas or any of the visceral solid organs we're looking about seven different filters looking at at different ways top to bottom front to back to really be able to see what's going on and that's where what we call contrast density becomes really important in the fact that when we're actually looking at the pancreas in particular we can actually pick out the pancreatic duct as well as in bile duct and be able to see that just standing out against the rest of the organ and one of the first most common things that pancreatic cancer likes to do is to actually start to walk that duct and so that's why when the ERC peas are done they're actually looking for her cells of pancreatic cancer and an ERCP is basically when they go down into through the mouth and the esophagus and they actually go and take a trace of fluid from the pancreatic bile duct so one of the other things that kind of amazes me when we go through these images here is when we've talked a little bit about the hardware they'll actually I kind of want to come back and ask more hardware questions but it's almost like you've created your own software now as well I had never seen this is it commercially available to have that rotating diffusion-weighted image math is that a commercially available piece of software or did you guys make that we actually built that as a display tool and that's actually effectively taking a page of the nuclear medicine positron emission tomography or

[01:51:52] PET CT handbook and the reason why we actually put together is because it actually allows you and effectively a pretty efficient viewing to be able to see what's going on through the entire body it's almost like making a transparent person and we're basically any of the black spots that stand out would be the hard spots or the firm areas and the one that we've just looked at earlier I remember you saying that if

[01:52:16] I understood you correctly one of the advantages of using a quote-unquote low-power magnet like you're using is you don't have any of the gaps in the spine you've got this everything that you showed on that rotating diffusion-weighted image you have the dark brain obviously full of firm fluid and then you have this dark beautiful tail coming out of it which is the spinal fluid but it was perfectly smooth right and that's actually one of the important things because magnets actually have a lot of homogeneity problems we call them and the fact that you want it to be perfect so at the field in between the top and the bottom and the left and the right are identical and as soon as you put a person in there that comes in various sizes and shapes they actually distort that magnetic field and this sweet spot for the magnetic field is perfectly in the center and so when we put all these protocols and built all these things we actually built it for different body shapes and we can actually go and tune it for all these body shapes so that the goal is that no matter what when we're doing these rotating images that it looks like a normal person not a segmented piece of a person yeah it's when you say that she took a playbook out of the pet/ct that's exactly what it looks like it looks just like you're looking at the fdg-pet juxtaposed with the CT right and that's the entire purpose and so that's why I talk about the MRI being this tool that can actually combine functional imaging of in this case do a absord ewi diffusion-weighted imaging and the MRI being the equivalent to the CT which is far more tissue weightings in detail it's where the one plus one equals three now if the radiation didn't bother you of a whole-body PET CT and of course it should bother you because a whole-body

[01:53:50] PET CT would be more than 50% of your it'd be probably close to 80% of your annual allotment of radiation right if not home or you'll be quite high and depending on if you live at altitude or where you live right so if you're at sea level you'd probably be allowed one a year maximum if not one every two years yeah so putting aside that issue which is not trivial what advantage do you think that the MRI with DWI has over the

[01:54:20] PET CT and where does the PET CT have an advantage so if you go either by histology by tissue by tumor type with the PET CT with radioactive glucose one of the areas that actually doesn't work very well at all is the brain and the MRI is always known as like the best image of the brain the PET CT you can actually miss things in the brain because what you're looking for with the radioactive glucose is areas of increased glucose utilization and the brain in particular is a glucose that's all it can use unless you're in ketosis and then the other problem is that the glucose is then excreted by the kidneys and so the kidneys now become difficult to see because they're actually full of glucose and as is a bladder you can't see a thing in the bladder because it's full of the accumulated glucose as well in the prostate prostate is very very poorly fused and as a result it doesn't get a lot of glucose coming to it and so that is actually almost entirely useless with FDG and looking at the prostate diffusion-weighted image of the prostate coupled with the more advanced molecular tests the 4/k as an example of a blood test when my mind have totally revolutionized the way we think about prostate cancer so we now have a blood test that produces much better resolution than just a PSA but more importantly we have this MRI and even in a practice as small as mine I have had two patients for whom PSA is high 4k comes back high so these are patients who now have a 20% chance maybe 16 18 20 % chance of having cancer in their prostate or having metastatic cancer over the next act two decades that's basically what the high 4k tells you in the olden days we would have just biopsied them and now we run them through this MRI and the answer is nope that's totally fine right and that's actually where MRI becomes very very powerful particularly with the DWI and and I think in many countries it's now coming to us and becoming more popular but in Australia in Europe particularly

[01:56:26] UK Scandinavia it's actually the de facto standard basically almost all men are actually getting screened with MRI well did you say in Europe and Australia yeah they're actually doing it with a DWI and so how is that even possible that countries with single-payer socialized medicine could use an MRI for a screening tool I mean that would be unheard of in Canada wouldn't it well I you know we just don't have the access to the number of machines here but I think one of the things that people are actually finding with screening for the prostate is that all men are either gonna die with or from prostate cancer and so you really want to be able to separate those out and up until MRI with

[01:57:02] DWI came into effect there was no real way to do that so he'd be doing PSA or or kay and all I would do was say yet there's an increased risk of something going on but is it going on so PSA in particular it can actually be elevated for three reasons one prostate cancer the other one inflammation and or prostatitis and then the third being enlarged prostate and so if it was up for any of those causes then you would actually go and take a biopsy which actually comes with risks but the whole idea is that all the staging was based on that tissue sample whereas what's happening very similar to the breast is kind of like a lot of people are saying well treating this is like a big deal I don't want the biopsy and people get a choice of what they want to do a lot of men are saying look I want to see what's going on I want to see if there's gonna be a change and if it actually starts to grow or something's growing in the prostate at an accelerated rate that's what I want to deal with it whereas if it's actually just there and holding still and not changing much I'm not gonna worry about it because something else may take me first is DWI going to have the same effect on breast cancer in other words if you could put resources aside for a moment if a woman could have a mammogram and a DWI MRI and it's important to point out that you can't eliminate mammography because we're going to come to this but MRI has its own blind spots and small calcifications would be a blind spot but with those two tests mammogram and DWI MRI done the way you guys are doing it not just off-the-shelf are you gonna miss breast cancer in those situations pretty unlikely and actually there's been a couple of really nice big studies that have finally started to come out from groups at UCSF and as well at sloan-kettering Memorial sloan-kettering in New York they've actually shown that you did your fellowship but the Moral didn't you I was actually there for quite a while actually doing PET CT okay amazing institution absolutely amazing but what's actually come out of the MRI group is that basically if you actually use DWI with MRI you actually are as sensitive as giving a contrast injection breast MRI well but that's diffusion done right and the problem is out of the box it's not always done right yeah that's the challenge I think for the patient right is the patient's look you kind of need a

[01:59:11] PhD in physics let's be honest who really understand the nuances of MRI I consider myself pretty technically smart when it comes to the physics of this stuff and I would not feel competent to try to differentiate or even parse out the differences between scanners in fact anytime I'm sending my patients to a scanner I sort of have to rely on other people to help me I have to reach out to experts and say hey is my patient has to get this scan done in New York or in San

[01:59:41] Francisco or LA is this the best we got if they're not going to get on a plane and go to someplace where I know exactly what they're going to get so that's a significant challenge right because there's people are gonna listen to this and think okay well as long as it's diffusion-weighted imaging MRI it's perfect yeah and that's actually the biggest problem with them are I like earlier on we talked about CT having units of

[02:00:00] Hounsfield like Hounsfield units actually sort of calibrated and standardized them unfortunately MRI has no standardization whatsoever and there's actually a movement called Kiba or quantitative imaging biomarkers alliance it's a component of the radiology Society of North America that's actually really trying to push to standardize the amount of signal-to-noise coming off of MRI machines with the goal that if you actually get a scan at one site or another site the image quality is the same right now it's really not that at all and really is sort of caveat emptor low code so right now if somebody goes to Shreveport and gets a 256 slice CT scanner on a Siemens pick your favorite model and they do the same thing in

[02:00:44] Seattle you can share those data across radiologists and it can be made to look identical your acquisition is the same relatively so what I mean by that is that the actual amount of signal on your film or on your screen water is going to be zero and so the Hounsfield unit is always going to be exactly calibrated so what's the opposition I mean that seems like a no-brainer what is the opposition to doing this with mr it actually relies on the vendors coming together and a few years ago we actually spoke with a bunch of the vendors and saying you know look why don't you guys do this particularly for a diffusion where it's actually so important because this is such a new and powerful sequence and they all kind of came back and said well you guys write a white paper and then we'll implement what you said and this is fortunately starting to move forward with this organization Kiba of RNA and they're doing it organ by organ so there is a bit of a standardization for prostate for liver and as well breast is now coming out and that was actually the breast was led by a group out of

[02:01:42] University of Washington and the overall leader for this as a person named Michael Bosse out of the American College of Radiology and this needs to move forward because otherwise people have no idea what they're getting and it's really sad because even if you walk down the streets for example in a place like New York I used to live literally 20 feet from a MRI shop and they had all these sort of images and what I consider just sort of bogus propaganda all over their window like why go down at Memorial and get your MRI there when you can come here and do a standing MRI it's comfortable it's fast and Volvo blonde I'm thinking to myself and it sucks so and I again I don't know that that exists in Canada but it's her in the United States there's a bit of a cottage industry around one-stop shop scanners that I think patients just don't know what they're getting into right right and I don't know how well it works in United

[02:02:32] States but it really is it's like because of this lack of standardization in the field of MRI and and it's really unfortunate because this is of all the imaging tools it's the most powerful but it really does need to stability for standardization and it may also sort of be the fact that in order to make it standardized you need to get the physicists together with the radiologists who are basically the high of the final image and quite often that doesn't happen because of language barrier right and of course it's not it's the language of physics is the language you know going back to the hardware for a second where do you see things evolving in other words if you had to project where you think you with the right technology would like to see this in five or ten years what could make this better what I'd actually like to do and when you see sort of what we're doing the speed with which we do and that the detail and resolution that we're able to acquire in about fifty five minutes is really unprecedented anywhere but I know from a physics point of view that I could speed this up further right now everything we're doing is perfectly within FDA specifications there's nothing outside of the box but I really would like to push this thing go outside of the box and what that really requires it's a lot of a lot more computational horsepower it's really difficult to do all that computation within a single CPU machine on site whereas I expect it in the future as

[02:03:47] Moore's law and computers get faster and faster you can actually do a lot of this stuff computationally and make it much faster and the goal to really be to actually have these scans that we're doing you know under half an hour even faster and it can be done from a physics point of view it's not a technological barrier even with the magnet that you have even at 1.5 yeah now I had my scan today a friend at a scan today and one of the things that people always talk about when they're done these cans is my god it gets hot in there what is it about a whole body MRI even one that's done in as short a period of time as 55 minutes that makes it so uncomfortable by the end in terms of temperature really has to do with the amount of energy that's being absorbed so what we're doing with the electromagnetic field means you're actually putting in radio frequency right and that radio frequency is always also coming out and that radio frequency is the same thing as a cell phone would get that's called SAR or a specific absorption ratio and the hydrogen ions are basically moving around and that's basically effectively heating you up so it's not quite like a microwave but you can actually think about it as a microwave the wavelength is exactly very similar to an AM radio and so your cell phone is typically far more powerful so as an example I went and did the calculation a while ago on how much SAR we're actually putting into a whole body printable scan and it's equivalent to talking on a cell phone for about four hours interesting but it concentrates it across your whole body right yeah it's funny every time I get an MRI or a whole body the first 30 minutes I'm like it's not so bad and then the last 10 minutes

[02:05:20] I'm like get me out of here right and we've actually done it that way on purpose because we kind of know that the way we kind of run our sequences or filters together is that we actually kind of want to make get as much information such as yeah you do the head first and that's not nearly as much as doing the abdomen and thighs or probably wear a ton of that heat kissed generated right and is sort of knees to abdomen right and so when you look at basically the overall blood flow which is what's cool is your body well the brain takes 20% of your cardiac output so it's basically like this big cool it's this big heat sink it just cools everything away whereas when you get down and lowered to the legs which you're all muscle it's gonna heat that up and so that's why we figure out how to orient these and what organization to make what plan of sequence is to make it not as uncomfortable commercially what's the best off-the-shelf scanner that could come close to producing the resolution you're producing which is it fully isotropic it's isotropic in the brain but in the rest of the body we're actually doing more conventional clinical images tell us what I said tropic is I'm sorry I should have clarified that sure so what isotropic basically means is that it more bassy slicing you in cubes so a one by one by one millimeter cube for example and the power of actually doing that one by one by one is that you can now look at things again in three dimensions in any direction you want the detail and resolution is perfect and so that's what isotropic means whereas

[02:06:41] MRI typically can't be done isotropic just because of time you want to cover as much as possible but you want what we call in-plane resolution which is how you orient the first gradient to have the highest amount of detail and then you typically will take a perpendicular view and that's why when you do these rotations off your sagittal plane the resolution deteriorates wildly in conventional scans right right exactly and so the diffusions that we're doing are gone isotropic but unconventional not often so that's why when you rotate and hopefully in the show notes we'll be able to get some videos like we'll literally just show what it looks like because I know this is a kind of a difficult discussion to have without being able to kind of picture for us it's easy but I think we want to make sure that the listener can see this that's why you don't see any distortion when you rotate to Twi so is there a commercially available scanner that can do that not yet someday not yet and so basically your goal is just to be I don't know how to put a time stamp on it how far are you ahead of what's happening conventionally

[02:07:39] I mean four years ago you were doing things that I still don't see any scanner doing in the country and I see the best scanners thank you but well for example like when I have a patient that went to one of the most famous hospitals in the country and had a dedicated prostate CT scan it took 40 minutes just to do the prostate dedicated prostate MRI MRI no CT ESO he had the dedicated prostate MRI took 40 minutes that was on a 3 or 4 Tesla magnet and so he spent two thirds of the time to get a slightly inferior image by resolution especially on the DWI was far inferior to what you were doing on the whole body all comes down to basic engineering of signal-to-noise if you can make all the hardware that you have really sing your signal to noise is so much better and then you can basically dial it to effectively where you want so if you need more and more signal depending on your machines

[02:08:36] I guess horsepower and coil configuration just takes time it's always a balance between time and signal-to-noise so where is machine learning going to come into the fold here you actually mentioned thing to me recently that I had never thought of which is it's really hard to throw a whole body image at a machine and have it solve even the simplest problem that we take for granted as a human which is which one's the liver which one's the kidney and whereas if you weren't doing a whole body if you were just doing a liver image that's an easier problem to hand the Machine because it already knows it's looking at liver so I mean how far are we away from a machine being able to help you do this

[02:09:18] I think there's actually a lot of tools that actually still need to be written so for example part of that is to really kind of look at organs and isolate organs conventionally most imaging is done by body part so head neck chest abdomen pelvis and not connected together and so when you actually give a machine okay here's your brain it's actually able to kind of go through that relatively efficiently but part of it really comes down to building the tools to actually analyze whole body like even the software to view the whole body is exquisitely complex but the difference is that when you actually start to build these tools it can actually start to help us narrow down what's going on and the goal is to really sort of have machines make radiologists more efficient and also more importantly we never want to miss anything right and so you know we can't have a second reader all the time but if you have a machine being a second reader you wind up actually training that machine as you go along and I think most people would be comfortable with that and that's what's actually done in mammography right now and so from I mean mammography obviously is like the tip of the iceberg but you got to start somewhere right it's very I don't want to minimize because I couldn't read a mammogram to save my life but but it's relative to what we're talking about it's much simpler it seems that where the machine might first be able to make a dent in what you're doing is not the patient who gets their first skin but the one who gets the repeat scan that seems to be paired t-tests seems to be an easier problem to solve and an important problem to solve because a lot of times for us as radiologists like those those studies we still do things the same way when we review them whereas when you actually go and you take like a paired t-tests like you said and you actually do a subtraction or where you're looking for the difference or that Delta it can actually stand out and become very very simple and very obvious and once that subtraction is done and I think that's where machine we'll actually really help make us more efficient and at the end of the day we just don't want to miss anything well

[02:11:07] Raj I've monopolized more of your time today and that means that there have been probably three or four fewer patients that have been scanned today so I really appreciate you taking the time and I appreciate just all the time you've spent over the last three or four years educating me you're incredibly generous with your insights and I I constantly lob questions at you and you've always got all the time in the world for me and by extension the my patients and all the people that I hope to sort of try to educate with this so thank you for the amazing work you're doing here and then also just for your generosity oh thanks it's a pleasure I love it I need to visit more often yeah next time you come down to California we have uber you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter thea MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what
