## Description

Original release date: 11/25/19

In this episode, Dr. Debra Kimless and Steve Goldner share their knowledge on the science, policy, and market evolution of medicinal cannabis. We start with the differences between THC and CBD, how they work in the body, and how they act on the brain. We discuss the many potential benefits of using CBD, THC, hemp in the various forms of administration (smoking, vaping, edibles, oils, etc.) as well as some of the safety issues including the recent uptick in incidents of hospitalization and death linked to vaping. Debra and Steve are both involved with the company, Pure Green—Debra the Chief Medical Officer and Steve the founder and CEO—whose aim is to create the safest, most efficacious form of delivery of cannabis. Their bigger mission is to shift the perception of the cannabis plant, garner acceptance of its medicinal benefits, and ultimately get it descheduled on a federal level so more people can access cannabis for a range of chronic ailments.

We discuss:
-Debra and Steve’s background reason for their interest in medical cannabis [7:00];
-The history of medical use of cannabis [11:15];
-How THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids work [16:00];
-Hemp—What it is, special uses, and the 2018 farm bill [22:45];
-The legal status of CBD, Deb and Steve’s clinical trial, and how CBD differs from THC [30:15];
-The safety profile of THC [35:00];
-Is marijuana as a gateway drug? [45:30];
-Smoking vs. vaping vs. edibles—Benefits, risks, and mechanistic differences [53:30];
-Can you build up a tolerance to the effects of THC? [1:15:00];
-What do people generally want to get from using marijuana? [1:17:15];
-Cannabinoid synthetics [1:22:30];
-Efficacy of CBD oils as a sleep aid [1:25:00];
-Pure Green Cannabis [1:30:30];
-Anecdotal evidence and managing the hype surrounding cannabis in medical treatment [1:38:45];
-Aspirations for the future of medicinal cannabis, and the legal challenges that await them [1:45:15];
-Descheduling cannabis: A human rights issue [2:04:00] and;
-More.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating or something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level it makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week our dr. Deborah Kim las' and Steve

[00:04:14] Goldner I'm not going to say much about them by way of background because I opened the interview by asking them to introduce themselves because their backgrounds are so relevant to the discussion we have I sought out both Deb and Steve because I wanted to have a discussion that would frankly first and inform me but obviously provide the necessary and relevant background information to all of you as listeners on a topic that frankly it confuses me to no end which is the entire morass of THC CBD hemp cannabis that whole landscape and truthfully I've never fully been able to understand this in part because I think it's just very confusing in part perhaps because I haven't put enough effort into it but you know preparing for this podcast was a great exercise in doing just that in this episode we talk about a lot of things but we start frankly with some of the semantics you know what is the difference between THC CBD where do these things work how do they work in the body what's the difference between what it's doing in the brain and what it's doing elsewhere and how do molecules work that aren't neat and clean like designer drugs where one molecule hits one receptor as you'll see cannabis it works very different form that we also then get into some of the safety issues at the time of this recording which was in late October 2019

[00:05:31] There is obviously an epidemic or at least a perceived epidemic around the dangers of vaping we touch on some of the reasons why that may be the case but really for the past three years we have been witnessing both a market evolution a scientific evolution and certainly a policy evolution which may be the most important as it pertains to this subject matter and again I think as you'll see in the first few minutes Deb and Steve are really great people to have this discussion with because collectively between them you have a medical a pharmacological and a regulatory expertise that is brought to bear now it's worth pointing out that both Steve and Deborah are involved in a company

[00:06:12] Steve is the founder and CEO of pure green and Deb is the chief medical officer and I point that out to say everything must be interpreted with a grain of salt and obviously Steve and Deb have a commercial interest in this space now I will tell you that after spending two hours with them or slightly more than two hours during this podcast also spending another hour with them off mic getting into stuff that we just weren't comfortable talking about on mic

[00:06:36] I come away thinking very highly of them very highly of work and believing that their intentions here go far beyond just the commercial intentions of people involved in this space this is a confusing topic and I won't represent that this one podcast is going to answer every possible question you have the good news is it might not matter if it did because frankly this is an area that is evolving so much and I suspect this is a topic that I will need to go back to probably a year from now so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with Steve Goldner and

[00:07:08] Deborah kindless Deborah Steve thank you so much for making time to come and talk about this stuff today this is kind of an unusual podcast in that we weren't introduced through anybody I sort of organically reached out to you guys on the basis of so much demand and so many questions about this topic which is something you know as I've alluded to

[00:07:31] I'm completely ignorant of so this is a topic I've been really looking forward to learning about because patients ask me about it constantly I think the implications are only becoming more significant as we watch the evolution of the legal environment so having a physician and a lawyer to talk about this is perfect

[00:07:52] Deb can you give me a bit of background on your interest in this your anesthesiologist I know you specialize in pain tell me what drew you to this specifically so what drew me this to this is that my mom was dying from a complication from a pharmaceutical drug and because of that I started really thinking about what we learned in medical school how we were trained and what else could there have been for my mom as an option other than a pharmaceutical and as she lay dying my significant others in Israeli said you know they're studying medical cannabis in Israel and unfortunately my mom didn't have an opportunity to try medical cannabis as a pain reliever because she died but I spent really since 2013 until now studying and investigating the veracity of whether or not cannabis truly is a medicinal molecules

[00:08:45] Steve how did you guys meet and how did you get involved in this well I've been involved in silikal formulations as a scientist for almost 50 years now as a forensic toxicologist New York medical examiner I worked on 18,000 autopsies so I developed and formulated the drug liquid drug methadone about 47 years ago because friends of mine were coming back addicted from the Vietnam War so that worked out pretty well developed that formulation methadone is done very well of helping people around the world and I went on to become FDA attorney working in the pharmaceutical industry but always working in this arena I became interested in cannabis as a medicine almost 45 years ago a friend of mine came back from Vietnam war with PTSD and he asked me to develop a drug that would help cure him of that and I noticed that when he smoked marijuana he felt much better when he drank or got pills from the VA he did not and so I realized that cannabis could be a medicine but it just wasn't legal at the time and I wasn't that right kinda lawyer to get that legalized now I have that opportunity to be able to do it that's what brought me into it he also my buddy who's passed away of cirrhosis of the liver about seven years ago made me vow to do this so developing methadone at the beginning of my career was a first book end and now developing all these formulations to help people with cannabis is the second bookend on my career and how did the two of you meet so I lecture around the country and around the world and I present studies that I have done on my own these are case studies I treat over 400 patients free of charge a bad business model but what I've learned from these patients is tremendous using diet changing cannabinoid medicines and I share them with colleagues so that they too can understand cannabis is medicine and

[00:10:53] Steve and I met two years ago at in Cologne Germany I think it was at I ACM where I was presenting a poster and he tracked me down and we had our first conversation there and together you guys are part of a company we'll probably hear a little bit about that company today but the aim of this company I assume is to create sort of what you perceive to be the safest most efficacious form of delivery of cannabis is that a fair assessment yes that's exactly it

[00:11:24] I think to understand why you guys do what you do we have to understand a whole bunch of things that I don't understand right now so let's just start with some history how long has cannabis been consumed by humans to the best of our knowledge historically it's been used as a medicine for over 5,000 years

[00:11:43] I mean this is crazy it's new for us now but it's not any medication in Asia the king fancied himself a pharmacist and he was treating people for all sorts of disorders from gout to absinthe memory believe it or not even though people are like dude where's my car here he was you know helping people with memory loss with it you know the ancient Greeks used it topically on their horses which is why I I do know that the acid forms of the cannabis medicine actually work because they love their war horses they applied the cannabis leaves to the horses bodies to reduce the swelling inflammation and infection after a war or a battle historically when did it sort of fall out of favor back in favor it said I mean for most people when they think about marijuana they sort of think of the 60s and 70s as this era in which the public sort of got to know it and it became then sort of demonized when was it actually scheduled Steve I think that was the beginning of around 1930 or so that is there were a number of individuals who thought that this was just a completely inappropriate drug to be allowed out a recreational drug and there was a lot of movement towards controlling people's appetites in many ways including drinking alcohol that have floated in and out through America and across the world so it began then with an idea of prohibition and it was really given a much more emphatic push under the Nixon administration for its often said for their own political purposes of being able to disenfranchise people who would utilize marijuana young people or people of color and that became essentially the war on drugs policy that was promulgated through the United Nations and around the world because the United States often was the funder of those activities that's continued for quite some time but is now as everyone knows dramatically dramatically changing now unlike the sort of psychedelics which were actually scheduled only about fifty years ago you're saying marijuana was scheduled in the 30s I mean that's it before the FDA well FDA has been around for at least that long and the originally scheduling of this was under DEA as a narcotic drug and therefore it would not be allowed and DEA really had much more of a law enforcement orientation while FDA does have a staff of essentially policemen working with them they're not organized in that manner so they're much more organized towards what is a medicine what's a food and how to be able to keep our American health policies the best possible for people you talked a moment ago Deb about topically applying this how did people do that was that an oil and what was it I mean not that you were there at the time and we could go back and figure it out but to the best of our understanding what is it that was being applied to for example a horse or how was it being used medicinally 5000 years ago it varied depending upon the indication and what they wanted to do but though the horse example was they were actually applying leaves to these horses the actual you know family is a regular leaves there are small amounts of trichomes on those leaves with cannabinoids in them so it of course it would work it was really interesting in

[00:15:27] India they would mix it with heat and milk and make something called bong PHA NJ and they would drink it as an anesthetic for people so it really did very it was very interesting that people apply these things in different ways so today when people think about marijuana the thing they probably have in the back of their mind is more related to the properties of THC is that correct yeah I think that most people when they think of cannabis think about it as THC intoxication and smoking so let's talk a little bit about that so you use the funny reference a dude where's my car so Jeff Spicoli falling out of the van big plume of smoke coming out after him he is taking a leaf he is smoking that leaf more Lemmy's with broken pieces of it rolled up into a joint and being smoke right so cannabis as a plant is very interesting right so when it grows in nature it grows as a flower the leaf does have some cannabinoids in it or some of those medicines in it but really the the most bang for your buck it comes from the flower where that's what it is so

[00:16:39] Spicoli was probably buying off the street and maybe it's getting some leaf but he's hoping for some flower because that's where the majority of the medicine is and you know drying it out and rolling it up and then combusting it the interesting thing is you can eat the cannabis plant all day long you may get a bellyache from all the the fiber but you won't get that intoxicating feeling because it's chemical constituents are not in a way they can get you in toxicated I see okay so let's talk about how that intoxication works what is THC stand for tetrahydrocannabinol and what does it do in the brain so our brains have these sort of docking stations called receptors and chemicals act on different docking stations or receptors in order to affect a change so THC works on these docking stations in our brain and our peripheral nervous system known as cb1 receptor cannabinoid one receptor was a very interesting name for it but that's what they call it and they're also cannabinoid 2 receptors cb2 receptors were found poorly predominantly on immune cells but also another tissue as well and in other organs and so THC has this really unique ability to activate or sit on the cb1 and cb2 receptors and did you say both cb1 and to our peripheral they can be cb2 predominantly is peripheral cv one is predominantly in the brain and then other nerves so the peripheral nervous system and what is the next chain of events so once THC binds to these receptors what happens inside the cells oh gosh so depending upon where in those receptors are located we'll determine what happens so for example if it's in the hippocampus it may stimulate Aries in that area that will help you extinguish memory so for people with

[00:18:35] PTSD who cannot stop thinking about certain things that area of the brain extinguishes memory and help somebody with PTSD maybe to get some sleep how do you think it acts with respect to pain it's a multi-modal different way of doing it so centrally it does interfere with periaqueductal grey areas these are areas of the brain that conduct pain signaling where a brain actually understands this also works perfectly on immune cells to decrease inflammation and reduce cytokine expression so it works in a whole host of different ways we're used to thinking and medicine actually as an allopath of a single molecule single target but what you really learn is that that's a great way of understanding how a drug could work but that's not how it works in in a biologic system known as a person or and so contrasting this with what you talked about with respect to your mom's care for example she was probably being prescribed opiates I'm assuming so my mom actually died from fracturing to death from a pharmaceutical known as a bisphosphonate from Fosamax the weird thing about my mom is that she was one of the 20 to 30% of people who when they took opiates had an enhanced response to pain not a decreased response to pain so basically she was you know using CMN ofin and nonsteroidals to try to reduce her pain which when she spontaneously blew out her pelvis you know didn't really help that much so we were just hoping that since medical cannabis works in different methods for pain relief it could have been an option for her would have cured her but could have helped her now one of the other effects of inhaling marijuana for many people seems to be an increase in appetite do we have a sense of why that's the case and that's I remember certainly in medical school that was even something that we talked about a lot was patients that had you know wasting syndromes either with cancer or AIDS this would be a great way to help to meet exactly so there are areas of the brain that control appetite and nausea and vomiting as well in the area in the medulla in those areas is replete with cb1 receptors so when those areas were stimulated your appetite is stimulated and you actually have a desire to eat which your right is life-saving for somebody who has wasting syndrome or who has chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting there's this other thing that now people talk about a lot called CBD I probably hadn't even heard of this until maybe four or five years ago I mean Steve how long has CBD been understood as a distinct part of this equation so this is a truly revolutionary new molecule to come out into the public consciousness so quickly it's always been in the plant and available to use but it's because people were so entranced with the idea of let's get stoned or then let's do some science on this stoning aspect of THC that that drew most of the attention it's just really in the last two or three years that CBD because of its non hallucinogenic effects has become interesting to people because it appears to have it does have so many medicinal applications and at the same time doesn't get a person stone how is that possible what is it doing chemically to create that distinction so different than THC CBD does not sit directly on cb1 receptors or cb2 receptors but works either indirectly activating the endocannabinoid system or it works on completely different receptors and so together it has a synergistic effect with THC or all the other molecules that live in the cannabis plant or by itself is pretty effective as a medicine now in nature do they come lockstep one and one for every molecule of THC is one CBD coming with it or how does that work so in nature it doesn't exist at all right it isn't until you apply time and temperature and get rid of that acid form that carboxyl group on either THC or CBD or any of the other cannabinoids so that's kind of interesting as a baseline anyway but CBD there are cultivars or plant strains as known in the street can grow in higher concentrations in certain cultivars it can occur as a one to one one molecule to a molecule it depends upon the strain that you're growing the legal definition of hemp is something that's higher in

[00:23:23] CBD a and less than 0.3 percent THC I'm glad you brought that up tell us a little bit more about the difference between hemp and cannabis specifically and again using the CBD THC delineation so the legal definition is for hemp cultivar is to have less than 0.3 percent by weight of THC or TGA actually compared to the rest of the biomass or the rest of molecules in the in the plant technically that would make anything hemp that doesn't have THC in it right exactly yeah so people use cannabis plants and just crossbreed so that THC is less than 0.3 percent so that they can grow it but you know the term of industrial hemp back in the day when our Constitution was written and sales were you know being made out of hemp it's a totally different plant as it is today just because of crossbreeding and forming the way we're doing it Steve the the farm bill brought this to the forefront recently tell us about the farm bill and why that's relevant I want to come back to this but just well we're on the topic of hemp it's important I think for people to understand this distinction the Congress decided pushed forward by several legislators who had large numbers of farmers that this would be a really good cash crop for them when you think of it these products are selling for thousands of dollars a pound compared to 50 cents or a dollar a pound for lettuce or tomatoes so if you're a farmer you'd much rather grow something that you can get thousands of dollars for the idea was put forward that this should be something that's allowed now we can see across America that people really are interested in it that medicine can be developed from it so it was with this idea that a number of legislators particularly Senator

[00:25:21] McConnell had a number of farmers in his jurisdiction wanted to be able to help them in their businesses and in their in their personal lives to be able to develop this otherwise these products are imported from overseas and we'd like the American population to be able to have a good well regulated source of product here I think that was the entire idea behind it was that we would bring the US Department of Agriculture as well as other scientific bodies like FDA to be able to begin to study these products and help the growers all of the growers that have worked on cannabis hemp products have had to do this for generations without having someone like the USDA around to tell them what pesticides were appropriate to use how to grow it how to have good growing conditions for it so this has really helped I think to be able to advance it was the farm bill basically just an economic package that made it more attractive or was there some legalization that was previously not there the farm bill really provided legal cover for farmers to be able to grow the hem and then to be able for processors then to be able to process it into oil and be able to turn it on into other products so it started out as something to just aid farmers but now it is moving through the economic distribution chain and that's why we can see it now in nearly every drug store or big-box store as finished goods on the shelf what are some of the products that come from the hemp plant there are vape cartridges certainly although they're not at the moment not all that perhaps professionally done except by those who are licensed to be able to do it there's a very large gray or black market in it but there are lotions creams ointments you can find CBD products in ice cream and tea soon it'll be in coffee and nearly every other consumer product that's available is the idea that there are certain hemp products that do not contain CBD and certain hemp products that do or is the implication that all hemp products are containing CBD so I think what you're asking is about the industrial uses of hemp beyond the cannabinoid and so you can put that flower into seed and make hemp seeds from it which has a wonderful profile omega-3 omega-6 probably better than anything and a wonderful source of protein as well the fiber that it comes from it heme fryer has a tensile strength of steel or greater than steel where you see plastic goods you can actually substitute for hemp it's just really expensive machinery for now until the figures have been it displaces the petroleum and plastic or what is it displacing yes it displaces the petroleum of plastic so you can make a credit card out of hemp fiber you can make hemp creep so instead of concrete you can actually use it make it to make it concrete you can there are BMWs right now that are using parts of their their door panels and dashboards using hemp you can make cloth you can make clothing you could make sellers Sam has a sense of you take all of the biomass that's being produced in the United States from a hemp crop today how much of it is being used for all of these industrial uses and how much is being used just for

[00:29:04] CBD I assume the latter is a tiny fraction of it oh no I think I think CBD is the lion's share of it because that's where the money is right now you know the decortication machine the machine that is required to break down this stock which is incredibly fibrous and tough is very expensive right now but and I think that you know there's such a huge interest at least in the United Way but especially in the United States for

[00:29:30] CBD as a potential medicine or tonic that's where the money is so it's a lot easier to extract and make derivative products than it is to create a lot of these other iterations and I just described as an industrial use but let me just interject that some of these other uses are just remarkable and have been around for a long time Henry Ford personally was very proud of having developed a hemp mobile and he actually built had built a car that ran and its fuel was fueled by hemp oil so the entire car in the 1930s could have been put out on the road and they had to shelve that project because suddenly hemp was illegal because it was came from the marijuana sought marijuana plants when did CBD become federally legal I assume it is federally legal today or is it still state regulated well it certainly is state regulated in each state has its own regulations the federal regulation of it is continuing to unfold the farm bill has legalized heme itself it has not directly said that CBD is okay to put into products rather there's been an intense push on the Food and Drug Administration whose responsibility is to regulate those kind of consumer products that they should move expeditiously and actually Deb testified before FDA about five months or so ago on the safety and effectiveness of CBD to help them in their data gathering so when you spoke to the FDA Deb what were the main points you tried to get across the main points that we discussed was about a clinical trial that we ran using a water-soluble iteration of CBD for mild to moderate pain in 16 patient cohort and the result of it and I wanted to share that with safety efficacy and our results let's talk a little bit about that so you said 16 patients that had mild to moderate pain meaning what what was the etiology of their pain so it was multifactorial

[00:31:56] I didn't just stratify to one condition because I just wanted to see it was a proof-of-concept trial and I actually didn't think it was gonna work Steve was kind enough to let me formulate an ultra low dose 5 milligrams of CBD with some curated terpenes in a water-soluble tablet I gave it to 16 patients who were had mild to moderate pain for which they were treating their pain with and over-the-counter medication and we ran this trial for two weeks and we had statistically significant decrease in pain across all 16 patients how do you control for the placebo effect there was there a control in that study there was nine again it was a proof-of-concept study to see if this ultra low dose of

[00:32:44] CBD would even work and it did there's no control for a placebo for it for really for anything I mean I know lots of patients I'm sure you do as well that seemed to really respond to a whole host of medicines whether it comes from a double-blind randomized trial or not how does CBD in your mind differ from

[00:33:04] THC we know obviously how it does for an intoxication standpoint how do you think it differs in the remainder of the profile it works mechanisms of action you know so for example CVD doesn't sit on a cb1 receptor but what it does is it interacts with the breakdown products of our naturally-occurring endocannabinoids which does sit on a cb1 receptor so by enhancing that that's one pain relieving mechanism of action you know it interfere and interacts with dopamine norepinephrine epinephrine type receptors and enhances those chemicals as well so it works in a multimodal way just like all of our other medications

[00:33:50] I'm trying to in my mind wrap this idea around a Venn diagram of THC and CBD where does does that make sense where you have certain things that they both do and then things that are unique to each of them does that make sense to think of it that way it doesn't it doesn't so I understand as an allopathic physician that that's how we like to look at things that's a very reductionist view of it and I think it's this is really a botanical medicine we really have a lot of different constituents within it there's over a hundred different cannabinoids over 80 plus terpenes flavonoids and probably constituents were not smart enough you have to even have figured out one of the terpenes do terpenes occur in nature in all kinds of plants and in foods that are giving the taste and this scent to all kinds of things and they're anti inflammatory they're actually secondary metabolites like the cannabinoids as well and it's used for the plant not for our benefit but for its benefit as a natural pesticide a antioxidant and it works that way in our bodies as well I want to come back to sort of the THC side of the equation let's start talking about some of the health risks and/or benefits and let's start with the risks what do you think are the most important risks to understand from THC use so I think everybody is different we're all an N of one and we all respond differently to the same type of thing so if I give one person an aspirin their headache may go away somebody else may die of you know an allergic reaction to it in some people who are very sensitive to THC they may not just feel intoxicated but they may feel so much anxiety and panic that they are incredibly uncomfortable and some is dose dependent but some experience that even with a small amount some people experience a feeling of well-being with a little bit of THC some people have a rapid heartbeat and their blood pressure shoots up and have an uncomfortable experience how much of that do we think is setting dependent so if you took the same person administered the exact same dose by the same route but under different settings either the actual physical setting therein or the emotional state there in how much can that impact the response I think anytime you're dealing with something that plays around with neuro chemistry set and setting is always a huge important thing you know same thing with alcohol I think there's one part of this is while we're talking about the safety or potential adverse events from this that we should also address in my experience this has the lowest toxicity potential of any pharmaceutic nearly of almost any product I've ever seen that is in the course of history we really do not have any deaths or truly serious events that are attributed to THC or CBD at all it is so less toxic than water common over-the-counter drugs aspirin tylenol etc and certainly far away compared to alcohol which is truly toxic what is the reported ld50 of THC so there really isn't and you cannot madellaine to people what ld50 okay so ld50 is the lethal dose that it takes in order to kill off 50% of a population usually in mice or rats with THC and

[00:37:40] CBD and all of these cannabinoids it has never been possible to dose them with enough to be able to do it so that there is just as a simple cutoff generally that it's something more than 5 grams per kilogram so that's a tremendous absolutely tremendous amount of cannabis to be able to take on in the 70s an attorney for the DEA actually was writing in support of D scheduling cannabis said that the lethal dose 50 it would take a 75 kilogram man to smoke 1500 pounds of cannabis flour in 15 minutes in order to die and you wouldn't die from a cardio respiratory effect from cannabis it would be from probably carbon monoxide poisoning did Willie

[00:38:33] Nelson try this I think so okay but he wasn't able to do he's still alive or so it's interesting what Steve was saying is that the receptors those docking stations there are no cb1 receptors or very few in the cardio respiratory centers of our brain different than the opioid receptors the immune receptors where you overdose because that docking station gets activated by heroin or percocet or oxycontin and you slow down your respirations and you stop breathing and your heart slows down in your heart starts beating and you die that doesn't happen with cannabinoids because those receptors don't exist in those areas of the brain where that would happen and so literally to this day you can over consume cannabis and you may feel like you want to die with this incredible anxiety or psychotic event but you're not going to so it's sort of like LSD in that sense where it really doesn't have a known upper limit of toxicity from a pure cardiorespiratory standpoint by comparison

[00:39:38] Steve you worked in the medical examiner's office for so many years what's the ld50 of ethanol and that's a great question and I can't remember the answer right offhand however I do remember [Music] the level at which people are intoxicated by this and generally we all know to be one or two shots of alcohol or wine or beer and that it very quickly becomes a disorienting drug with just a second one particularly the problem is that people don't think they're disoriented by it and that they are actually under control it's a very different situation with cannabis usually as people take on these substances within their body they actually know that they're stoned and have a sense of it and are able to be able to rectify their own behavior usually it's called just sit on the couch and watch TV or something like that yeah there's another point here I think on the toxicity the probably is worth mentioning and you could probably speak to this with more accuracy but it's sort of how I explained toxicity to people it's not just what the ld50 is it's how far the ld50 is from the use dose consider acetaminophen you'll very easily go and take a thousand milligrams of acetaminophen I don't know what the ld50 is it's probably between 10 and 20 grams that's not that far away that you could be that you could only miss the dose by 10x and kill someone is amazing

[00:41:14] I'll tell you a ridiculous story this is I don't know why I'm good answer it's but it's just an illustrate this point I remember in residency once during our internship a guy accidentally wrote a prescription for one gram of ativan instead of one milligram of ativan so he wrote for a thousand times more of the dose which is a clerical error that came from his just being careless unfortunately the nurse working that day was very new and she took the order as one gram of ativan and to make matters worse the pharmacist on-call that day was also new and realized in the Pyxis system there's only only have 20 milligrams here so that's you know twenty one thousandth of what you've ordered I'll send it up right now and go and get the remain 980 milligrams that patient was actually administered 20 milligrams of ativan and of course had a respiratory arrest that's toxicity so they that's a lawsuit right it's a therapeutic index and so they say for over-the-counter drugs it's it's like you know one to twenty you take you know two aspirin and your head it goes away forty and you're gonna be in the hospital for something like you know valium or or ativan it's usually a one to ten yeah but look at alcohol that's my really my point I wanted to make look at the therapeutics index of alcohol three drinks shouldn't kill anybody thirty would kill anybody right exactly and they say that for the therapeutic index for cannabis so one to twenty is over the counter one to ten is like a divan or valium it's one to twenty thousand to one to forty thousand is the therapeutic index so the greater that second number the bigger the safety profile you know we call it a therapeutic window I call that a therapeutic garage door right there are certain drugs that are simply just narrow therapeutic index drugs and need to be very very cautiously prescribed I should point out for anyone who's listening that there really isn't a therapeutic reason to dose alcohol as far as I know unless you're rubbing it on an insect bite or something like that alcohol is not really recommended for curing any particular disease I want to just kind of go back to something that I forgot to ask you earlier because I got distracted in my thinking about the next thing I was interested in why do you think during the Prohibition era alcohol was brought back into favor and marijuana was not because I think it would be very difficult to make the case that alcohol is less toxic than many things I mean alcohol is about as toxic as it comes and yet it is completely accepted societally why do you think it was I mean this is again just speculating on my sense of it was it's the sociology at the time we live in very difficult times and certainly they were very difficult at those times and it seemed that people really need to have a release from the tensions of the day the idea of creating the prohibition of alcohol was pretty quickly recognized as not successful that is it simply drove it underground people continued to imbibe it and what happened was there was no control there was no tax stamps there was no health inspections that went along with it and the people who were utilizing it were demonized even more than they were before so it was sort of a contraindication for the society although it certainly came out of people in their heart thinking they could make their fellow man better by not having them be allowed to drink then cannabis was not brought back I think at the time it was societally it was a bridge too far for people to be able to reach and it was apparently not a plant or an intoxicant that was used by frankly the people who were in control of writing the rules and the laws but the legislators felt pretty comfortable drinking and they didn't think they knew anyone who smoked marijuana a lot of people talk about the idea that marijuana is a gateway drug what is the state of the evidence of that argument in other words what are the pros and cons of that argument to the best of our understanding so it's an interesting question I always say that cannabis is a gateway more towards health into other drugs and in fact NIDA National

[00:45:57] Institute of drug abuse on their website has agreed with that statement and no longer considers cannabis as a gateway drug but I think what people are looking at or concerned about is young people participating in the intoxicating effects of of cannabis or alcohol or high fat and sugar foods just like anything else can be leading to other addictive behaviors but there really isn't anything that proves that cannabis is a game 'we drug we sort of have natural experiments that have gone on with the legalization in the in the states that were at the forefront of this are there data that we could take from I guess

[00:46:42] Colorado would be first Washington State would be second are there data we can take from those states that could point to either a rise or fall in the utilization of drugs beyond marijuana that have either gone up or down since the legalization it depends on what how you're spinning this question if you're saying saying to this question that as a gateway drug Colorado has shown proof positive that there is not an enhanced utilization at least of cannabis from the black market in young people who shouldn't be taking it unless it was for medicinal purposes only if you're referring to the opioid epidemic for sure you know back uber has looked at states with medical legal programs with patients that have access to dispensaries there has been a statistically significant reduction in opioid prescriptions in patients for those four people have access do you think there's an association I mean again I don't know this literature so

[00:47:48] I'm not asking a loaded question I'm but I'd sort of know these arguments right which is nobody takes heroin without first taking marijuana is the argument there for heroin the precursor to utilization of that is taking marijuana which of course is a silly argument even if it were true I don't know that that's entirely true but it's a silly argument because you don't know what the denominator is on the other side of that equation how many people would take marijuana and not go on to use cocaine or opiates or other things like that so a is correlated with B does not mean a causes B and a precedes B does not mean a causes B either is there any argument though that one would make from a cautionary perspective about certain individuals who are predisposed to addiction who if in the presence of marijuana are more likely to take on harmful addictions

[00:48:42] I'm not sure that either Deborah or that well qualified in figuring out who could potentially have addictive behavior nor have I really seen any studies that are able to talk to this my sense of it though as having grown up here in America for quite some time with children myself and even growing up here in lovely New York City is that as people move through their teenage years they experiment with lots and lots of things lots of behaviors that are important interesting and sometimes risky behaviors marijuana is generally more available than any of these other perhaps hardcore drugs so it may appear that people are starting with marijuana but frankly you can get cigarettes on every street corner so therefore I think we should blame cigarettes more for beginning this inappropriate behavior that is sometimes addictive I don't think that marijuana itself cannabis in any way causes or leads people on into let's call it more hardcore drug addiction and I just have not seen data to be able to to prove it or disprove it one way or the other how addictive is

[00:50:09] THC like using formal definitions of you know rats you know pressing levers and things like that compared to things where the addictive potential seems to be very high cocaine opiates seem to have a very high addictive potential LSD seems to be the exact opposite right they'll never push that lever again where does THC fit on that spectrum on the low end of the spectrum below alcohol I believe it's below alcohol tobacco is probably one of the higher percentages than heroin gluten up below tobacco and I think they say the studies are 9 percent you know remember these are recreational markets or using animals at high doses lever pressing so doesn't really reflect real-world behaviors it take that a little bit further that there are medical centers right now that are running clinical trials utilizing

[00:51:02] CBD and sometimes CBD with THC as dosage forms to move people off of other addicted substances so that's to move people off of methadone to move people off of heroin so it may very well be that THC and CBD are truly an exit drug not an entry drug do we know about the effect of THC on a developing brain versus a more developed brain so the three of us sitting here presumably have done most of our brain development but the 15 year old is still probably in the throes of developing what do we know about differences under those circumstances so what I say to patients and other physicians is that I don't think we're advocating using any kind of chemical substance on a developing brain unless they need it but do we have actual data because the I know that I did try to look into this about a year ago maybe two years ago at the request of a patient and I what I found difficult at the time and I'm hoping maybe you have better data is that we just didn't have great studies because everything was confounded by recreational use without control so even though at first principles it seems illogical that you know a 15 year old is going to benefit from using marijuana it wasn't really clear from the data what what the case was so two years later with legalization in some states or decriminalization can we say any more than that not really unfortunately there haven't been the robust double-blind randomized trials in in people but when you talk about the 15 year old and should cannabis be used again people think of cannabis is inhalation so let's you know take that off the table for a second let's think about it is MIT a medicine so if this fifteen-year-old has a seizure disorder and there are constituents in this meta in this plant that can help with that that makes sense to use if this fifteen-year-old has attention-deficit or anxiety or depression and other medicines are not working or maybe the risks of those other medicines are a lot greater I think these are reasonable tools in our medical toolbox that can be used I mean people think about just THC is a very high you know intoxicating chemical it doesn't have to be you have to have the receptor you have to have the drug that sits on that receptor and you have to have enough of that drug to sit on those receptors to get that intoxicating effect so let's go back to something we talked about a little while ago which is the different modes or routes of administration so we talked about the

[00:53:45] Spicoli route and I guess the advantage of that route is it's relatively quickly the active ingredients become engaged with the receptors both peripherally and within the CNS in a very short period of time I'm guessing one of the drawbacks of that route of administration is dose to dose consistency and presumably you're inhaling other things that might not be too good for your lungs is there data on that so you're correct so your bioavailability in an inhalation 'el method is is fast and furious you missed the whole GI tract which is great so if you're somebody with MS and has muscle spasm that's acute inhalation method could be a godsend for them for sure you're right that the length or duration of action is a lot shorter than other methods of administration so if you're somebody with a chronic pain issue that's probably not your method of administration that you want to employ yes you get products of combustion so if you're smoking plant material you have a whole bunch of other things know differently than tobacco that can cause some issues there have been no studies in fact dr. Tashjian has shown that there has not been an association between lung cancer and smoking cannabis flowers yeah why do you think that is by the way I'm sort of surprised but I think it's a dose effect or or maybe it's the anti-inflammatory effects of of the cannabinoids themselves that sort of are kind of pre treating it I don't know I'm not smart enough to know that that was one study maybe we need to look at other studies

[00:55:17] I can't answer that what I can say though is we do know that heat does cause cellular change so for that reason I'm always concerned about it and for my you know patients that I treat I don't recommend inhalational method at all any inhalational method I don't only because I don't understand how to help them titrate because inhalation is different a smart in a small inhalation gives you one dose a deeper inhalation gives you a different dose your ventilation is different than somebody else's so thinking about this as an anesthesiologist from a clinical perspective outside of anesthesia where we're totally controlled we don't like to give drugs where we don't know the dose I think patients were really sick want their hands held in a way that they can wrap their head around it as much as

[00:56:09] I can so if I say use X Y & Z and they come back to me and say it works then we understand what they should take if I say take X Y & Z and maybe it doesn't work it only does partway then we have an understanding as to how to go how to pivot from that point inhalation doesn't allow me to do that is there anything else Steve from a chemical perspective so when I think of inhalation I guess I think of two vehicles I think of the sort of bong joint method where the temperature is like literally from the flame burning the material combusting it that then gets inhaled and then you think of sort of the vaping method where well tell us how vaping works actually vaping works at a lower temperature than the pyrolysis that goes on when you use a bong and some people even take it a little bit further and heat up a substance using an acetylene torch on a nail and then inhaling it that's really hot the vaping goes on at a much lower temperature and there are other dosage forms that are going to come out soon that are simply inhalers like Bronco inhalers where there won't be any temperature gradient at all and the product will be brought into the lungs through an inert carrier gas so that will allow a much more controlled dose those just aren't really on the market very effectively yet there's been a lot of talk about vaping lately and this is both from the lens of the use of

[00:57:49] THC and nicotine itself totally separately what do you guys know about this as it pertains to safety let's start with that that's an interesting question I don't think anyone really can put a finger on a specific reason for this you know problem at these big porches are causing tell people what the problems are that we're seeing so it looks like an acute respiratory distress syndrome so almost looks like a chemical burn to a lung where people have a respiratory failure that requires a huge amount of support in the intensive care unit including intubation and ventilation and another support measures so it's pretty severe and pretty significant when you extract cannabis it comes out as a thick goopy oil and you need to refine that oil in order to put it into cartridges and those methods of of getting the right viscosity for that oil to be put in that cartridge is done in a whole host of different ways and I don't think it was done intentionally to hurt people I think people thought oh let's thin this oil out using PG or pg-13 is safe but it's generally regarded as safe if you eat it and no one really understood what happens when you combust it for those two things I think it's formaldehyde gets created when you combust or heat up PG or pg-13

[00:59:16] EE acetate again generally regarded is safe if you ingest it not if you heat it up to a vapor or steam and so does the FDA not require a reanalysis if the FDA says substance a has a grass designation and substance a has historically been consumed at room temperature and subject to a first pass effect in the liver can anybody come along and say I'm going to burn said substance and it still maintains its grass designation does how does the

[00:59:48] FDA think about that the FDA allows something to be grass Daz safe for particular uses either as direct food ingredients indirect food ingredients part of packaging but once the product is out there in the marketplace and available to use it's America people will do whatever they wish with it and that brings us to part of the issue here is that this is while this is a regulated environment within the states there are many actors many producers who are not yet regulated it's kind of like alcohol was legalized and then there were still bathtub gin being made for many many years there were hundreds thousands of deaths from it on this vaping issue in particular I had some experiences at the New York Medical

[01:00:47] Examiner's some years ago on a syndrome that came to be called SIDS sudden infant death syndrome where we had to look at the lungs of a number of infants that had died in this way and so something similar is happening here we're in the midst of a quiet slow-moving epidemic where there are now thousands of people in hospital I think we have over 34 deaths directly attributed to it and week by week the toll continues to mount it's just not been brought out all that widely it does look like these are chemical burns within the lungs but then the lungs seem to be not regenerating themselves but the wounds are getting worse so does it behave like a RDS that's what it sounds like it's a lot of you know shell recruitment and then oxygenation you know doesn't occur but they're not 100% sure are they getting edema as well there's so far been a good deal of a lid kept on a lot of the discussion as both CDC as well as other health organizations are trying to find epidemiologic lucas's where events have occurred in a couple of cases they've been able to identify that there were individuals who made some vape cartridges where there is a higher proportion of people who have been hurt from other vape cartridges but there is just no clear-cut etiology so far so if

[01:02:28] I'm understanding you correctly we have no idea if the uptick in these acute toxicities is potentially manufacturing-related low sigh related diffuse we don't know any of those things yet that's exactly correct from having worked in this industry for a long time I'm very familiar with every time a new product even if it's something as innocuous as a lipstick it's changed there is a slight uptick in adverse events even from just changing the coloration in a lipstick or an eyeshadow because there are millions of uses of it you're able to see what happens in products like that that are where people are using them external to their body is it's a slight irritation and the person simply decides I won't use that eyeshadow anymore or that lipstick anymore and they self select out of the population here this is a sudden onset of a serious nature but even with all of these numbers of well a terrible amount more than 30 deaths and hundreds thousands in hospital this is against millions and millions of uses and that just doesn't seem to be a clear-cut cause that we were able to find so far you said something about my god I want to make sure I understand it because it seems staggering to me the

[01:03:59] FDA if you go down to the grocery store or the corner store and you buy a bag I don't know jelly beans and they come in a plastic container does the FDA have oversight into the plastic that holds the jellybeans yes yeah they do and the FDA says this plastic is grass yes that the individual chemicals that went into making that they don't look at the overall plastic bag but rather the individual polymers or monomers or the colorants have all gone through extensive testing now let's say I'm an idiot and I decide to create a new product which is I'm going to take the plastic I'm gonna take those constitutive elements in that plastic bag that holds the jelly beans and I'm going to combust it for inhalational use so new use of previously agreed-upon grass constituents does the FDA say

[01:04:57] Peter you can't do that or does the FDA say well gee whiz each of those things were safe to be touching jelly beans therefore you can be burning them actually a actually would be very annoyed at you what's the legal recourse oh the legal recourse was if you had turned that into a business as they would come and shut you down okay so the

[01:05:19] FDA still has their pants on and they would still be looking out to protect people from me doing that yes absolutely but not in a cannabis world why cuz it's federally illegal and the FDA is not a participant so you're saying that the fact that cannabis is still illegal federally means this entire discussion is moot and it would be at the state's discretion to police this type of use switching exactly that's exactly correct and that is part of the difficulty right now is that state agencies are not used to having the scientific horsepower or the the manpower or woman power is much better to be able to figure out what of these ingredients can or cannot be added to it and on top of that the producers of the products are not required to test them for safety or efficacy but for they start shipping the products which is very different than products sold under FDA auspices where you have to demonstrate at least safety for foods products and for drugs you also have to prove efficacy before you can make it and ship it prior to the explosion of these acute events of toxicity I was much more personally curious about chronic toxicity let's take tobacco as an example very few people have acute toxicity to tobacco use but by the middle of the 1960s it was abundantly clear what the chronic toxicity was from tobacco use alcohol is an interesting one alcohol has lots of acute toxicity you could kill yourself in a moment with alcohol that's a very easy thing to do but I don't know if your friend who died of cirrhosis had complications of alcohol use or whether it was hepatitis but certainly the chronic toxicity of alcohol in this country is the longest fattest widest tail we see along with tobacco perhaps may be fatter actually what do we think is the chronic toxicity or do we believe that there's any evidence of or against chronic toxicity from vaping things that we just haven't it hasn't been around long enough and we don't know but you're sort of playing with fire but logic I mean that's a feeling cuz it really hasn't been available as widespread it is is now remember 2014 2013 was when really other states started really coming on board I mean California was the first in 2009 there was nobody vaping then people were you know using cannabis as a flower to smoke people were using it in in foodstuffs to eat but nobody was using this vaping thing I don't think it was until the popularity of the vaping through the e-cigarette market when the cannabis market turned away hmm this is an interesting business an interesting mode of administration no products of combustion so people will feel a lot better about it and I think people honestly and truly thought it was a better mousetrap do you know what the people who favored that approach will argue in their defense so there's a couple of arguments one is it's better than smoking and getting products of combustion two it's helping me get off nicotine so I'm vaping instead so that's better and three people who have an acute pain issue or a muscle spasm feel like the instantaneous nature of the effects of this is what they they require I think that manufacturers of cannabinoid medicine are looking to do things with the cannabinoids I know we are and I don't want to push our product but we are you looking at changing the solubility from a fat-soluble to the water soluble method of administration makes the bioavailability a heck of a lot faster just not available across the country cuz we have a state license in

[01:09:23] Michigan and we can't sell it across state lines yeah I want to come back to talk a lot about your product because when you said that a moment ago that I couldn't understand how you were talking about water solubility of this so let's between the three of us remember to park that and come back because I could use the chemistry lesson going back to the toxicity point we talked briefly about edibles earlier well we didn't we sort of indirectly did you said that if Spicoli ate that flower he might have got a belly upset but he wouldn't have got high why is it that when people consume edibles they get high because it's a different constituent they're not using the raw plant they're heating those chemicals so when people are making brownies yes the batter's yummy but they generally bake it at a certain temperature for a certain amount of time and there are actual curves that show when THC in its acid form in its raw form gets converted to or some people call its activated form into THC so it takes time and it takes temperature before you make that conversion and at that point when you eat it that's when you can those chemicals can sit on the receptors that make you feel high or intoxicated so it's again it's very unlikely you'll make two batches of brownies identically because time the area under the curve is almost always going to be different so everybody gets a different brownie now when you get the candies or things like that is it the extraction of the THC required heating to get the active ingredient into these commercial edible products so it depends on what you're making I mean there are medicinal auklets oh yeah and ease and stuff but there are medicinal properties in the raw form as well as the heated form so if you're making it for the direct purpose of intoxication you're gonna heat it the starting material first you know the active ingredient first the THC and then you're gonna put it into your chocolate so this might be a bad analogy but you know how anytime you make coffee you're basically running hot water across a beam but if you're a real coffee snob you'll do a cold brew so that you can extract the flavor without the temperature and you avoid the bitterness it seems to me that whether you're talking about smoking a joint lighting a bong vaping or eating a candy or chocolate or a brownie heat always seems to be required if you're going to get this active ingredient out is that the case if you're trying to get education right for intoxication so so the answer is yes you have to apply timing temperature in order to make THC and then you put that THC as your starter ingredient into whatever it is and the variables for the edibles is not just the preparation of the food but that our digestive process varies hour to hour person to person as well as our body mass and how we feel about things and what the time of day is in the cicada and rhythm so it's almost impossible to expect out of eating any food that contains THC or CBD to expect that you will get a reliable repeatable dosage experience from that even if the label is completely correct and completely accurate and that's a big if it is yes it is the legitimate laboratories in cannabis have gotten better and better and better all the time but still when you make a batch of a thousand brownies and you just sample one or two of them there's an awfully good chance that the batter may not have been mixed appropriately pharmaceuticals sort of solved that because of the consistency by which we make things in a pharmaceutical way but foods are not quite that precise and you know you can buy a brownie at a store one day and then buy a homemade brownie the next day and it can taste very different how many strains are there of cannabis that are commonly used from what I've heard there's over 800 but people are crossing and back crossing all the time but back to the edibles thing that I think is even more important is that when you eat something and it goes through your stomach and it goes to the liver and gets cleared it gets chemically converted and so therefore you're really not even ingesting THC anymore you're ingesting its metabolites and that metabolite is even more intoxicating than THC itself so there are people who are experienced in inhalation ulm ethel's of THC they do it all the time that say they can't even eat a THC brownie or a gummy bear or you know drinking a soda with it in because it's far more intoxicating do you think there are any appropriate might be the wrong word but just call it what are the best use cases for edibles I think the best case use edibles are for somebody with a chronic pain so let's take example somebody with a chronic pain that can't sleep at night let's take an extreme case somebody with cancer that's spread to their bones right and they literally can't sleep so what I would do with the patient is I would trial them on a certain edible or something that I believe is consistent it wouldn't be held within a foodstuff most likely be in a capsule or tablet because it makes sense be Ken remember we talked about wanting to understand the dose and wanting to understand what it is we would dose it in a way that it would be the same time every night for this patient and we would see how they would sleep the bioavailability takes about 60 to 90 minutes in the best-case scenario you only get about 8% of whatever it is that you're taking but it can last up to eight to 10 hours we haven't talked about tachyphylaxis or tolerance how does the body respond to repeated administration of THC that's really interesting

[01:15:14] THC sits on these docking stations receptors and there are chances of over-consuming THC and down ray regulating these receptors that actually can be reset very quickly by just stopping for a couple of days but there's an interesting study out of the Netherlands since they've had a medical program for a very long time and I think since 2012 or something or 10 where they looked at patients the average patient only takes 750 milligrams of cannabis a day and you would imagine if there was so much tachyphylaxis you would have seen an increase or rise in that and you didn't seem like they stabilized it 750 milligrams and that was it which is contrary to what I just said so explain explain the opposite talk about opiates you've obviously as an anesthesiologist had lots of experience with them what typically happens to a patient who is prescribed opiates for pain that's the problem with opiates opiates it on these their own docking station and they do down regulate very quickly which means that you require more and more for the same effect and then it does something really strange it flips and after a certain amount of opiates your pain gets enhanced not decreased and it's called hyperalgesia it's a strange phenomena you said 20 to 30 percent of people experience that actually 20 30 % of people experience that from the beginning where they experienced an opposite reaction to to pain relief but I'm saying people who traditionally get pain relief who require more and more and more for the same amount of pain relief suddenly they are experiencing a hyperalgesia an increase in pain whereas before a month ago you know two months ago they were actually getting pain relief nobody talks about that so we don't think that this is necessarily happening with THC and the cb1 or cb2 receptor no we're not seeing that yet as you know hmm let's talk a little bit about how THC mixes with other drugs what happens when

[01:17:19] THC is combined with alcohol for example alcohol is a known depressant of the central nervous system I still don't really understand what THC is doing in the CNS still confused by the intoxicating versus non intoxicating effects I know that I can tell what you're thinking which is Peter that's the point it's a plant it's complex it's doing many things but it's multimodal actually so a little bit of THC won't cause any intoxication you need the receptor you need the drug and you need enough drugs sitting on all those receptors in order to express those things and I joke with

[01:17:52] Steve and say I like to be called the queen basically but the queen of microdose which means I like to use very small amounts of cannabinoids to activate things on a cellular level so you actually don't feel the intoxicating effects because most patients don't want to be sidelined by their pain and they don't want to be sidelined by their pain medicine so that's kind of off topic is that the majority of your personal focus

[01:18:17] I mean I I want to come back to obviously what your company pure does that makes sense there but what about people who actually want some of the intoxicating effects because well let me unpack that a little bit more is about to say because of things like anxiety or stress but you could make the argument that if one has their anxiety and stress reduced without intoxication that might be just as beneficial have you thought much about the particular demand the consumer demand what is it that people actually want from THC my sense of it is that they would actually like relief that is over and over again I did a extensive survey of in Michigan we have over 400,000 people with medical marijuana cards and if people who were going into cannabis dispensaries two-thirds of them were really there for medical reasons not to get stone they had learned over the course of their lives that they could reduce their pain often chronic pain from very serious accidents or operations they could reduce their anxiety and they had learned that they could find strains of marijuana and they were using them and smoking them because it was all that they had available to them so these are people generally who were just looking to live happy normal lives like all the rest of us and that they have found that this is a relatively inexpensive and pretty harmless way to manage what are otherwise very very severe symptoms so that if going back to your question about utilizing alcohol at the same time there are some people who utilize alcohol regularly in order to frankly numb the pain even without listening to any Frank Sinatra songs about the heartache and why we're all still in a bar at three o'clock in the morning it's for pain relief or its psychological and sometimes straightforward physical pain relief once people discover that they can achieve that by using a small relatively easy titration form people who utilize cannabis smoking or vaping are readily able to titrate themselves which is just remarkable to be able to do that certainly I did when I was smoking cigarettes I could learn how to accelerate my heart rate or relax by just puffing in a different way I gave up that addiction myself hmm interesting

[01:21:03] I don't think I appreciated that that you could have that distinction from I get presumably from the nicotine depending on that yes but why their speed at which you take on that nicotine I could either excite myself to be able to get up for something or you could use it to calm down and relax by just simply dosing in a different manner do you think there are certain medical conditions that are contraindicated from the use of THC for example I'm making this up I have no idea someone with schizophrenia or someone with severe psychiatric illness can it be exacerbated by THC the short answer is yes but that doesn't mean that they should not be availed to cannabinoids because again there's over a hundred different cannabinoids specific to the cannabis plant that could be and has shown to be incredibly useful so yes high dose THC alone could stimulate somebody who has schizophrenia to have an exacerbation of those things but CBD and maybe even a low level of THC along with it could actually be hugely beneficial back to your question about THC and other drugs

[01:22:14] THC plus opiates has shown that a reduction in opiates with a greater pain relieving efficacy without that tachyphylaxis or tolerance that that we know to be true for opioid use how much time do you still spend in a hospital setting or an inpatient setting do you have any you spent any time there zero anymore do you have any sense of how long it will be before THC and or CBD make their way into the for example post-op surgical patient world sure

[01:22:45] Navin all which is a synthetic THC has been on the market since the 1980s and we as doctors are allowed to write prescriptions for it across the country and patients can travel with it that's available now and it's being used for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in some settings not very well because straight up THC is really uncomfortable it does increase your heart rate does make your mouth dry does make you feel agitated and uncomfortable I mean the rest of the constituents within the plant sort of modulae all of that I'm glad you brought this up because I was gonna ask you about the synthetics the synthetics have a pretty bad rap there's sort of the teleological argument of you know nature always packs the right amount of this antidote versus that antidote I mean what is your take on synthetics through that lens in particular that's a complicated answer I mean I think what I'm really wanting in focus more about is a single molecule as opposed to looking at many of the molecules within the cannabis plant and try to find utilization you know so a single molecule like CBD from epidemics from GW Pharma came from a plant but it is isolated and purified to 99.99% and it requires a tremendous amount to get the effect that GW Pharma wanted to get on two types of seizures we formulate using isolated to monoids but we join them together along with other constituents so we use less and we capitalize on the synergistic effects of a lot of the molecules no differently than what we do in medicine is an anesthesiologist we just don't push one medication we push a lot of different medications to lower the bad effects of one particular medicine and capitalize on the good effects of all of them say more about the GW CBD for epilepsy what is the purity of it you said it's 99 it's pretty high it's greater than 90% tell me about the success in utilization event so it's plant-derived but it's isolated so it's purified and they have it for two particular types of seizures those kids with these rare C's reforms that are refractory to multiple other traditional pharmaceuticals I think they have like a 30% reduction in their seizures but there's side effects I mean there's GI effects there's liver issues I mean there's side effects in high high doses of of epidural X what do you think is the potential for CBD and sleep something that gets talked about a lot what is your take on the efficacy of CBD oils let's start with the oils which are very commercially abundant well let me first mention my bias I took it this morning at one o'clock in the morning because as usual I'm up for an hour trying to do something and it's a little noisy in this city and I needed to go back to sleep so it is in our hands and our experience it works it simply works that is people are able to take CBD we think that taking it as an oil is less effective than taking it in a water-soluble form but it is certainly effective we have pharmacovigilance data on several hundred thousand people that demonstrates that they generally go to sleep pretty quickly have a great night's sleep and wake up refreshed with no feeling of what other sleep aids give of grogginess or anything like that most people think it is just fabulous do you have any insight into what the mechanism of action is so member multimodal mechanisms of action so anti-inflammatory it also activates the

[01:26:38] GABA receptor decreases anxiety and a lot of people have that three-year-old running around in their head at night and prevents them from going to sleep so we think it is central activation of gaba that is would be one of them and have one potent mediated there's a molecule out there called Fenna butte which is an oral form of gaba that crosses the blood-brain barrier now the

[01:27:00] FDA has not designated at grass so therefore it's no longer available easily but for something that was for so long over-the-counter it was you know kind of a remarkable sleep aid so one shouldn't underestimate the potency of CNS gaba activation is there any sort of poly Somnath at talks about staging of sleep with CBD in other words it's one thing to say great you know a person can sleep for this many hours uninterrupted but do we have any sense of the impact of CBD on sleep architecture I haven't seen any data like that and what your questions are remarkably and remarkably perceptive you have to realize that at this current time because of the still illegality of

[01:27:47] THC and the confused legality about all of the others that pretty much every University especially medical universities do not allow research to be done on the facility unless someone has a DEA license and even then getting that the EI license is a long drawn-out process so that very little work is able to be done and there are thousands of medical researchers who would love to work on these problems but they can't just like they haven't been able to for 50 years but is CBD not permitted for research if the THC level is low enough that's only come about in the last few months so it certainly takes a lot longer for research protocols to be developed to move through NIH to move through whatever funding opportunity there is and I expect that in the next year or two or three that there'll be much more research done on that it's still a highly restricted highly restrained and frankly the university administration in almost all of these schools and universities are very very worried about jeopardizing their federal funding for billions of dollars of other projects in other words it's not that there's a dearth of funding if a philanthropist came along and said to somebody at the

[01:29:19] University of Michigan in Ann Arbor hey here's five million dollars I want you to study the effect of CBD on sleep duration and architecture the university would say well thank you for that but I don't want to jeopardize the billion dollars of NIH funding I have is that it might understanding you correctly yeah well I wouldn't pick on U of M because my wife works in pathology there so but it's a great school terrific school football's coming back folks that any university in these stages will move much more carefully to consider what the research is and who is the researcher simply because of 50 60 years of illegality it's just so surprising to see how far behind THC and CBD are when you have a beautiful roadmap from organizations that have been funding so much psychedelic research I mean you look at maps the multidisciplinary

[01:30:15] Association for psychedelic studies started by Rick Doblin I mean started this organization in 1986 33 years later they are now in phase 3 studies using MDMA which is as you know obviously schedule one I'm kind of amazed is there not a comparable group that is advocating for the judicious study of THC and CBD we are we run clinical trials regularly dr. Kim Lee's here is running clinical trials right now and there are others but they're from let's call it private sources so is that the business model of your company is that you have a product that you sell and the proceeds of that help fund the research yeah that's pretty much it we came up with formulations that we felt would work and then we ran pilot clinical trials to see how they would do in a small patient population and once we saw that that was getting a very good response among people then we were able to distribute the products within the state because we are state licensed to be able to do that and now we are taking the funds from essentially from that cash flow and scaling up to be able to do studies under FDA office auspices which are frankly much more expensive to do because of all the controls that go along with it talk to me how about this idea that we alluded to twice already which is the water soluble ization of something that I didn't assume could be water soluble eyes we have a number of patents on it and a number of them are moving through so you'll have to forgive me for sort of speaking generically about that we have one issued patent out of the seven that we filed for and that was to figure out we figured out how to freeze-dry cannabis and that's an industrial process and it helps so that's an aborted patent and anyone can look that one up THC and CBD and all of the molecules that are in cannabis that appear to be useful and viable are all oil soluble they are not general they are not water soluble so if you put them in a glass of water and stir it you'll have little oil globules on it so we figured out how to be able to convert that instantly into a water soluble molecule so that when a person puts a drop of this or a powder of this on their tongue it doesn't taste oily it doesn't feel loyalty and it doesn't act like an oil and as everyone knows yeah you can have some oil and vinegar maybe on your salad but the body doesn't really like to have a lot of oil in it on a regular basis whereas everybody can drink pints and pints of water gallons of water perhaps a day so these molecules are rendered to be water soluble and because they're put into very very fast rapid dissolving tablets that disintegrate in about 15 seconds or so do they disintegrate under the tongue and therefore escape the first pass effect of the liver or exactly right under the tongue on top of the tongue mooshed around the tongue but they're not to be swallowed they're not to be swallowed they're called sublingual because it's under the tongue but what happens is as the tablet disintegrates literally in the mouth the molecules move towards the tissues of the mouth the tongue or throughout the oral cavity what we see is in about a minute the molecules have moved into the bloodstream and for those who are sensitive enough they can actually feel their toes tingle in two minutes which teaches us that we have full systemic absorption that frankly the molecules have reached person's tolls and then we find following that that people are able to experience whatever effect medical effect that we are looking for in about eight to ten minutes so that's the onset of sleep for sleep formulations the onset of pain relief for for pain relief for anxiety so that has the advantage it avoids first-pass metabolism it gets much more of the active drug into the bloodstream and to be distributed throughout the body so in theory you could actually lower the levels of drug that are necessary to do which how potent is this how is this a millimolar or micromolar drug I would say that this is closer to micromolar that is someone who's we found very effective that sleep works in someone who takes ten milligrams of CBD and one milligram of THC and that spread across a body that's maybe 70 kilograms 80 kilograms of weight this is a really interesting to me is that the optimal cocktail for sleep may actually have some THC in it yes opposed to just pure CBD it's our experience over and over again that this concept that's called the entourage effect when it's applied to cannabis but yet this is used throughout medicine as

[01:35:55] Deb mentioned as an anesthesiologist she used a cocktail of medicine certainly in oncology it's very very common to prescribe multiple drugs at the same time or in some sequence we found exactly the same effect and did it by clinical trials of seeing how it would be with patients getting feedback from them revising the formulations Rideau seing them and seeing how those effects changed does your company have a 501 C 3 attached to it that allows people to fund research in the way that Maps works no it doesn't so far it's me i drained my retirement account in order to do this as you said though as you move towards the more and more rigorous FDA studies it's something you should consider I mean I think the public support for this type of research is strong I think the public's appetite for this is strong you know if you think about it you have a harder problem in my opinion to solve then the psychedelic community does because at least there there's no ambiguity about the molecule we know what psilocybin is we know what

[01:37:05] LSD is we know what MDMA is there is no purity concern I mean there is if you go to a club or a party or something like that but from the standpoint of doing clinical research we know exactly what we're talking about whereas you're dealing with in many ways a more complicated set of molecules so you have two issues right which is not just the straightforward safety efficacy effectiveness chain of phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 you have a problem that lies beneath the surface of that which is route of administration cocktail chemical composition all of these other things I mean I generally try not to give unsolicited advice but my view is I don't know that you want to go alone at this problem because I think the work you're doing is very important you know

[01:37:53] I was at a dinner the other day and you know somebody at the dinner table was talking about you know telling a story and you hear these stories all the time right so I think the person is totally well-intentioned but and I just sort of sat there silently because I didn't really feel like debating it but the claim was a friend of my friend's father was in hospice with Stage four pancreatic cancer had weeks to live and they put them you know the family snuck in CBD oil for him and two weeks later he was home and cured and you know the problem with those types of stories is not only that they're almost assuredly incorrect it's that they sort of damage the credibility of a body of research because you start to have absurd claims that are thrown in with sort of legitimate claims how do you think about the sort of stigmatization of this and trying to manage the hype and the potential that's a really awfully good question so I should point out while there's only two of us here in the room this is a research team with a great deal of depth and breadth that is everyone I've worked with in pharmaceuticals for the last 40 years

[01:39:03] I've said oh my goodness please let me work with you on this and so we have that as well as a number of people who are fairly well-to-do who are looking at this as a business opportunity and an investment which I really appreciate and my wife is especially appreciative of so I can stop draining our own retirement account many of these anecdotal experiences are true I wouldn't have believed it myself honestly except for the fact that we have now sold six 700,000 tablets to tens of thousands of patients repetitively in

[01:39:52] Michigan and I watched it sounds funny to say the weak and the lame get up out of their wheelchair and move and say I don't know how to tell you this but what the heck is in your tablet and I just say well it's THC or ATS CBD in a particular ratio with these terpenes and families would say thank God my husband is living my mother is living my child's anxiety is greatly reduced and I know to classically-trained scientists and physicians that in this society at this time that seems damaging or inappropriate but in other societies it is not that way this is a sociologic event that is just beginning to spread and I know among many of my friends in police forces who are or EMTs and fire fighters first-line responders who frequently have a great deal of anxiety in their life and frequently a great deal of pain just straightforward physical pain aside from everything else that their personal experience with selected extracted purified cannabis has completely changed their thoughts about what they have for generations thought was completely inappropriate behavior now they say oh geez it gets rid of my pain and I don't feel so bad and they are still able to function perfectly well they're not stoned at all not in any way at all partly because the drugs are relatively easy to self titrate yeah I know it's a lot no no I'm not suggesting that one can't see improvements in those things I but I do sort of bristle against the notion that there are people with stage 4 cancer that are being sold a bill of goods that says you know take your metastatic pancreatic cancer and in two weeks you're cured with this III I'm waiting to see the first documented case of that and I'll continue to be an incredible skeptic of that sort of logic which is not to say that a patient with cancer wouldn't benefit immensely from real relief of anxiety or pain but yeah

[01:42:21] I just I have very strong believing that on rioter remissions so THC and other cannabinoids have been shown in the laboratory to have a multi-modal effect on cancer so in apoptosis which is cell death in migration or metastases in neovascularization it reduces it so there are actual reasons and rationale behind it you're right is there a double-blind randomized trial of people

[01:42:49] I think a doctor would go to jail if you had somebody who could have X Y Z traditional chemotherapy and okay here's a cannabis concoction that we've come up with I wouldn't believed it myself I can show you pictures afterwards we can't do it on a podcast the story is an eight-year-old girl in hospice she was on methadone and morphine our goal was to just treat her to get her off it so she had a better quality of life before she died and we transitioned her from hospice to second grade to third grade what was the underlying pathology she had a chronic lymphocytic leukemia and he left him maninjau spread she felt chemo radiation in a couple bone marrows she sadly died this this past summer again this gets back to the broader point which is I'd like to see this studied more aggressively because my greatest fear is watching patient I mean my greatest fear is safety

[01:43:43] I think that's followed with predatory baby oh absolutely and I look and I just I can't tell you how frustrated I get when I hear stories about people who are spending their last dollars on cockamamie schemes that have absolutely no bearing I mean and and you know look there are lots of things that kill cancer in vitro that are good work in vivo so we just have to be cautious about it and yeah I know I definitely remember the pathways of even at ah Fuji and apoptosis and all these things where they cannabinoids play a role so again I think this all just speaks to the idea of kind of loading the boat to more effectively study this and of course I mean the criticism is you have a conflict right the criticism is how can you be fully objective and again this is something that the maps people can get away from because you know MDMA has no IP associated with it right merck developed this drug in the 20s now there's an interesting business model which is how would you incentivize people to study something where there is no profit Center at the end my view is you should be able to pursue this I mean

[01:44:50] I want to be clear I'm not suggesting that you guys aren't sitting here with the purest of intentions I it comes across very clearly and I hope the listener can tell that I I can tell how pure your intentions are and that creating a company is just a vehicle through which to pursue more research but as I think about the broader objective which is broader than just your company again I'll come back to this idea of creating a research initiative around this that even exceeds the reach of your company because remember the the number of questions here is harder right like I'd like to hear from you guys what question you're most interested in knowing the answer to in five years it would be great that the

[01:45:30] NIH could carry some of that burden right it would be great that independent Amaro's medical research organizations could carry some of that burden because no one's retirement account should be depleted in an effort to hold a promise true to a friend which is a in some ways a part of what started this for you what the sort of this journey for you it is exactly tell me a couple of questions like what do you not know the answer to today that you want to know the answer to with respect to THC CBD and its associated products in in five years what would make the world a better place for me I've made a vow that I will find a formulation that will relieve PTSD I made a vow to do that for people who were heroin addicts and methadone may not be the best of all formula but that's what I did when I was 23 years old and I got a little better as I went along so that is the driving force for me to be able to do this and then my goal is to be able to discover as many of these disease conditions psychological or physical conditions as we can extract value from these stunningly non-toxic molecules Steve further inds affiliated and associated with these molecules like are you in that phase one pipeline now yes we are we have three filed we actually just met with FDA three weeks or so ago over one of them and we are pursuing that very very actively so each time you reconstitute something it's a new IND that's right okay that's really folks because you're the expert miss explain to folks what an IND is and how important this is in this regulatory pathway in order to sell a drug in the

[01:47:21] United States you have to have an approved new drug application that's called NDA from the Food and Drug Administration so what do you do before you get that you have to go investigate that drug so it's that's what an IND is it's an investigational new drug exemption from all of the rules that say you have to have this approved drug so you go and meet with FDA we provide them with data and the documents that we have available and say dear FDA we would like to run the following clinical trial and here's all our evidence and do you folks agree with us and in the course of hashing that out they will come back and say we'd like you to do a little more work in with an animal model or we'd like you to do some additional studies in humans in a particular way and so we are in the process of doing that in three different therapeutic indications what are those three besides PTSD one of them is an animal model that is for pet dogs who have pain from osteosarcoma and the other osteoarthritis osteoarthritis of the knee and then PTSD right so those are pain and dogs pain in people particularly osteoarthritic pain as well as PTSD which i think of as a combination of anxiety and pain it presents in a number a number of ways mild moderate severe etc again for the listener to make sure I understand the distinction there are currently products you are legally selling in Michigan that do not require an IND they're currently grass products they're not basically

[01:49:06] Pharma grade products is that safe to say or is that a no these are pharma grade products simply because this is the space that I live in I have always thought that that was the only appropriate way to make products it's called meeting good manufacturing practices it's a couple levels higher than any of the states require for safety or efficacy and so we just make products to meet FDA specifications because to me that's just easier it's in other words you you're a this is gonna sound crass excuse it and you can clarify it but you're like a supplement company that adheres the GMP practice I don't think of us as a supplement company you make a supplement to a GMP this product for example like something that you can sell currently today without a prescription right we work within the medical legal roles in

[01:50:02] Michigan but those rules do not mandate GMP manufacture and you hold yourselves to that standard that's the yes I'm trying to make yeah that's exactly going to pay you a compliment and I'm making it sounded backwards but yes and this is as most everyone knows doing an adequate amount of testing to go through the FDA process is very expensive and very time-consuming and let's put some numbers to that on average it's about a decade and a billion dollars to create a new drug yes that's exactly right let's say that again you want to make a new drug from IND to approval is order of magnitude ten years and one billion dollars yeah that's right I don't think your retirement account is big that's correct so anyone out there this is gonna turn into a telethon let me ask why have you not pursued a product yet unsleep because I again I think anecdotally what you've said resonates with many people the power of

[01:51:04] CBD including probably very inferior products compared to what you're capable of making with your IP is the view that you don't need to go down the IND pathway to produce that or is it just a matter of resource allocation it really is resource allocation truthfully we have 14 indications that we are going for and you have to prioritize as everyone does with everything in your life and we looked at them and said which ones are easier or faster or less expensive to test and be able to prove sleep studies frankly are very expensive and they are variable just in the methodology of it whereas it's a lot easier to be able to measure pain and there are scoring systems that are more reliable in that way tell me a little bit about what you can sell in

[01:51:55] Michigan and how does a business work that can only limit itself to one state so it's quite challenging we drove at getting a license a first license and we were successful in getting the first license in Michigan to be a processor that is we can take in cannabis that's been grown within the state and turn it into an extractive and then turn that into tablets that's what the process of processing is we could also make it into gummy bears and vape cartridges and we sell those also and then we are able to ship those to just state authorized dispensaries historically people in Michigan needed to have medical marijuana licenses in order to get into those stores but now like many states it's called recreational or adult use you only need to show that you are 21 years of age to be able to go into those stores and buy so that's how we start but now we have grown to have we have liaisons with subsidiary companies or affiliated companies where we're growing about 5500 plants bringing it to our facilities doing the extraction and we have relationships with all of the 7080 dispensary stores throughout Michigan that's how that business has grown and that's to a large extent so far what's been able to fund our research studies but once again this is a telethon folks you can call in how how large is your team so we have overall about a hundred employees working in various aspects of production and sales and administration for the company in terms of the research team Deb is our chief medical officer and then there are about another ten or so direct people working on it and then another 30 to 40 consultants who come in and out of the projects to be able to work on those what will be required from a legal standpoint for products like this or similar products to be sold across state lines does that only happen with at the federal level yeah that only happens at the federal level we think that the first number of indications that we've picked and worked on with FDA are going to go through fast-track approval and that's without getting down into the weeds of all of the legalities of that that frequently allows a product to get through the FDA process in somewhere between two to four years in the space of drug development that's the blink of an eye and at the same time we're beginning our international aspect

[01:54:59] Deb and I will be in Berlin presenting our data at an international meeting of cannabis physicians so that this activity is very very quickly spreading not just here but across the country and across the world I was lucky enough to be able to be at the United Nations in 2016 testifying and telling the UN that they should change the war on drug policy from incarceration and retribution to medication and treatment and while things move slowly through the political process we see that that is taking hold in country after country that this war on drugs policy is changing dramatically too as countries are able to see the medicine and science for themselves it's very very encouraging how often do you get invited to speak at medical conferences that are not about THC or cannabis in other words how often is the anesthesiology society saying hey come and give us a talk on pain and the use of this because it's physicians we're seeing that our patients are using these things and we're ignorant murid sadly not often enough I do lecture to Grand

[01:56:10] Rounds for individual physicians and groups and departments that have heard me speak or see me on YouTube and said wait we need to have her come in I'm actually lecturing in Detroit next month to a group of scientists and engineers and biopharma developers who are interested in what we do and so that's sort of a unique space but I am actually hoping to target in California at the end of q2 for 2020 that I'm gonna speak with the Society of pain so I'm looking forward to that now this might sound like a dumb question but if you have a state like Colorado or California in which you have the same legal framework basically as Michigan why can your product nut ship from one state to another state because I have to leave

[01:56:59] Michigan and pass into another state before I get to Colorado even if I shipped next door to Illinois or Ohio for a microsecond it will be in federal land as it goes from state to state it's called interstate commerce and there was a very classic law case on this 150 years or so ago that defined what is in

[01:57:27] State Commerce and it's essentially just stepping over the border and sometimes even more than that just being on a federal highway what does the if you had to guess I know you don't have a crystal ball but if you had to sort of think about what the legal framework is going to evolve into do you believe that cannabis will always be illegal at the federal level or do you think that it will have a change in legal status oh it's absolutely gonna change absolutely gonna change no question about it it's so clear how long do you think this could take well we see that it is beginning that is hemp right now is part of that story it is the nose of the camel in the tent to be able to move this forward at this point we have more than half the states have said that these products are just fine for their patients for their population and FDA is currently very very actively involved in this I was fortunate enough to be part of a task force that started some years ago to be able to move this forward FDA is struggling to find literally a legal pigeonhole to put this into my suggestion for any of the FDA officials who might be listening to this podcast and I hope it's all of them that there's the over-the-counter drug review that has been used for many many years to be able to take products onto the shelves of drugstores to be able to use this based on the fact that people could self prescribe some medications for themselves they didn't need a physician to write a script so we think that many of these products have sufficient safety that they are self prescribed 'el and i think we see that because frankly there's about you know 30 million 40 million people using these on a regular basis right now and other than the vaping crisis they're not filling up hospital wards due to toxicity from these products they're able to use them okay so do you think that the farm bill is really the single most important thin end of the wedge because it was the first piece of federal law decriminalized the first part of the value chain here yes absolutely it really was I think that that will continue actually for many of the cannabis business people who are struggling in this area because the tax laws are incredibly burdensome and require a lot of dancing in order to be able to just simply run a business but we see ourselves a year and a half ago I had to switch bank accounts four times in one year for if anyone ever tried having to switch your bank account where your bank suddenly closes out on you every three months that's terrible especially as you're just trying to run a business and pay bills now though we have completely solid reasonable banking relationships we're able to get insurance everything is becoming normalized and we do not see patients or consumers acting foolishly in any way quite to the contrary they often are reducing their the amount of smoking of cigarettes and alcohol use and are becoming more law-abiding citizens than less debt what concerns if any do you have about what this industry looks like I mean I can't go more than a week without getting pitched some CBD

[02:01:12] THC hemp company I mean there must be more companies sprouting up some in some part of this value chain than than any other industry I mean this is from an investment standpoint this is an area where people are very excited I just don't imagine most of the people bring the expertise that your team is bringing which is why I wanted to talk with you guys as opposed to every other person out there who's peddling a cause but do you see that as being a concern in other words can a few bad actors set the stage back yes especially in the stigma area for patients that's my major concern is patient safety you know there are a lot of people out there that see a gold rush or green rush and they just want to make products sell them to people and get a Dodge and enrich themselves and that's a concern to me you know impatience unfortunately are not understanding that just because you can buy something off the shelf of a big-box store or from an online source that it's tested and it's safe because there's no guarantee to that and so you know my recommendation patience is if you live in a legal state you should buy from a legal dispensary ask for their certificate of analysis take a look at it make sure that there's no adulterants to the best of our knowledge and the science right now this is why I'm happy to work with Steve because this is his passion as well because we really don't want to hurt people I mean that's that's the thing that kills me that's the reason why actually the it should be D scheduled I mean so it allow for robust testing a standardized testing I mean just because there's testing in states doesn't mean they all use the same methods that's sort of something you guys brought up today that was news to me which was the inability of the states to rise to the level of federal testing and so in many ways the decriminalization state-by-state is not a great approach you can't just run that out to its natural conclusion without decriminalizing it at the federal level to get the full muscled of the FDA and the protocols behind testing absolutely

[02:03:20] I mean from laboratory to laboratory there are no standards and the problem is there's no guidance because it's been illegal and so the sources they laboratories would use to go to to say well where do we get our standards from and what are the methods of extracting from this gummy bear or this brownie in order to test the potency or test the microbials or to test any of it don't exist so look there are people listening to this in 49 states that are not in

[02:03:47] Michigan not to mention people that are listening to this outside of this country what would be your playbook for them to protect themselves as they go into their local dispensary or purchase online you can buy CBD across state lines if it's pure enough how would you give people a sort of instruction list of things to do - first and foremost protect themselves right so this is a human rights issue you hit the nail on the head I mean that's a huge problem for me as a physician to guide patients which I do i guide over 400 patients privately free of charge because I'm a terrible business person but for me to guide them and have to understand their state in order to help them access certain medicines is just horrific to me but what I would say to them is go to a legal state become certified as a patient meet with a physician there and get the guidance from that and buy from a legal dispensary do you think that's enough so

[02:04:42] I mean a physician in another state do they have the expertise to help them navigate through the dispensary there's a society called Society of cannabis clinicians or they have a list of doctors by state who actually are you know experts in cannabinoid medicine for which they can go seek out and help themselves I mean this is a nascent injured industry it's still federally illegal which allows for all of these hoops to have to be jumped through I would recommend not buying online I would recommend not buying off the street I mean we tell our children don't take candy from strangers because you don't could you don't know what it is why would our medicine be any different so I don't know that it's widely known but I developed the actual SI methods to detect LSD marijuana cocaine amphetamines and I published those results when I was 21 and 22 years old so I really have a pretty solid sense of what these laboratories are able to do that was well almost 50 years or so ago and it was my first scientific publications the labs are capable nowadays because I just recently set one up a few years ago of doing remarkably accurate and precise work on all of these cannabinoid products and to be able to do it but the state rules vary and the states are still learning what should the pesticides be that are allowed or allowable what are the levels of heavy metals etc so from state to state the rules vary and they are getting more learned as the work is done so this is a great developing field some labs are better than others to be able to do it so that's why is to echo Deb's recommendation for people who want to utilize these products they really need to ask for the certificate of analysis see if they can become educated enough to be able to do that certainly physicians should I know that it these systems endocannabinoids systems were not taught in medical schools they certainly weren't taught in the chemistry schools that I went to and this is a remarkable societal experience in allowing non toxic substances to be used and self prescribed I think it's a challenge for the physicians to catch up because you are a learned intermediary to help patients be able to do this and

[02:07:24] I hope out of this podcast that's why we're here is to help encourage all of these educational programs because frankly our hands are full enough just running the clinical trials and being able to run a business so we're gonna have to leave that part of it up to you well on that guys I want to thank you very much for coming down here today and for making time and for sharing kind of all your insights and for the work you're doing I mean I think this is I don't know I've got to be honest with you I think I'm still somewhat confused about all of the different permutations and combinations of these molecules and it's complicated by the fact that interstate commerce prevents easy access of higher quality products to individuals so I guess the thing we can all hope for is that and I guess I would say this frankly even if you are still undecided on the safety or efficacy of these everyone still seems to benefit from the decriminalization of this because it allows far more rigorous testing and it D stigmatizes so much of the research funding that goes into this

[02:08:34] I think one way or the other we get answers quicker and that's probably what we're kind of missing at the moment right this is a process that's unfolding in a very very short length of time I was at a meeting with FDA DEA and Department of Defense just four and a half years ago and NIH where I brought up the idea hey fellas you're the federal regulators and it looks like cannabis is gonna get approved state-by-state why don't we try and set some federal health policies here around that and just four and a half years ago everyone in the room except me said are you kidding that's never going to happen and now we see it actually has and so the people and who are in a role to be able to bring these forces to bear are trying to play catch up and do it and more power to them and

[02:09:32] I think that everyone should just try and continue to do just as you are doing here allow folks like us to bring our thoughts to bear and happy to hear from anybody we're not certain we have all the best right answers we have a particular predilection towards medicine and the idea that above all else do no harm first we just we're kind of pushy about it though thanks very much guys I really appreciate it thanks for having us thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye
