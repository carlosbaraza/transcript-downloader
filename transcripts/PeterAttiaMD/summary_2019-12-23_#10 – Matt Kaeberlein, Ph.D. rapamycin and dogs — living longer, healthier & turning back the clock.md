## Description

Original release date: 8/20/2018

Matt is someone who is deeply interested in understanding the biology of aging. Why do we age? What happens to us as we age? What are the things we can do to slow the aging process? How can we delay or prevent the onset of age-related diseases? These are all questions that Matt thinks deeply about, and explores these questions with his research at the University of Washington. He is currently investigating many of these questions through the Dog Aging Project and the compound rapamycin—the only known pharmacological agent to extend lifespan all the way from yeast to mammals—across a billion years of evolution. We talk about cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, healthspan, lifespan, and what we can do to provide longer, healthier lives for both people and dogs.

We discuss:
-Matt’s early years and his aha moment on aging [4:00];
-Studying dogs [6:30];
-Dogs, rapamycin, and its effects on lifespan and healthspan [15:30];
-An unexpected finding in presumably healthy dogs [36:00];
-Rapamycin in cancer treatment [50:00];
-Why isn’t there a rapamycin trial for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)? [1:01:30];
-If Matt could do a definitive study on life extension in dogs, with resources not being a concern, what does that experiment look like? [1:16:00]; and
-More.

About:
The Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking…and a few other things. With over 10 million episodes downloaded, it features topics including fasting, ketosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, mental health, and much more. 

Peter is the founder of Attia Medical, PC, a medical practice with offices in San Diego and New York City, focusing on the applied science of longevity. The practice applies nutritional biochemistry, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, techniques to increase distress tolerance, lipidology, pharmacology, and four-system endocrinology to increase lifespan (delaying the onset of chronic disease), while simultaneously improving healthspan (quality of life).

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with Matt Kaeberlein:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The episode focuses on Dr. Matt Kaeberlein's research on rapamycin and aging in dogs. The discussion covers his groundbreaking work using companion dogs as a model for studying aging interventions, particularly focusing on rapamycin's effects on heart function, immune system, and overall health span. The conversation explores how dogs serve as an ideal model because they share our environment, unlike traditional laboratory animals.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Dogs develop similar age-related diseases as humans but with different frequencies [05:10]
- Cancer is the most common cause of death in dogs, especially in large breeds [13:04]
- Dogs show less vascular disease compared to humans but more cardiomyopathy [11:20]
- Rapamycin showed improvement in cardiac function in dogs after 10-week treatment [34:43]
- High-dose rapamycin showed 60% life extension in male mice after treatment [44:07]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider age-related decline in organ function as a target for intervention [58:27]
- Focus on healthspan improvements before disease onset [09:14]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Rapamycin:
- Dog study dosing: 0.1 mg/kg three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) [34:43]
- Lower dose: 0.05 mg/kg three times per week [35:10]
- Current cost approximately $7 per milligram [1:23:32]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Cardiac function (ejection fraction, fractional shortening) [1:19:20]
- Activity tracking via GPS collars [1:19:20]
- Blood chemistry every 6 months [1:19:20]
- Microbiome analysis [1:11:45]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"I think one of the reasons why the preclinical research has been disappointing at developing therapies for Alzheimer's disease is because very rarely have people approached that from the perspective that this is a disease of aging." [1:04:47]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal dosing schedule for rapamycin in humans?
2. How does the microbiome influence rapamycin's effects?
3. What are the best biomarkers to track rapamycin's effectiveness?
4. How does rapamycin's effect differ between males and females?

8. **References & Resources**:
- University of Washington Dog Aging Project [multiple timestamps]
- Novartis MILES trial (mentioned regarding everolimus) [24:07]
- Texas A&M Veterinary College collaboration [1:24:53]
