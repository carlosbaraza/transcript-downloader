In this clip, they discuss:

- Cultural Trends Shift Beauty Goals – Patients’ requests change with time, influenced by broader societal aesthetics, media, and celebrity culture
- Social Media Alters Perception – Filtered photos and influencer content have changed how patients view themselves and what they desire
- Medical Trends Follow Cultural Shifts – Plastic surgery offerings evolve in response to beauty standards rather than driving them
- Prevention Over Correction – Many opt for early, smaller interventions like Botox or lasers to maintain youthfulness instead of larger corrective surgeries later

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this segment of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. Tanuj Nakra and Dr. Suzan Obagi discussing social media's impact on beauty standards:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The discussion focuses on how social media has dramatically changed beauty standards and patient requests in aesthetic medicine. The experts highlight the concerning trend of younger patients seeking unnecessary procedures and the impact of filtered, unrealistic images on beauty expectations. They particularly emphasize the problems with following temporary trends that may require expensive and potentially damaging reversal procedures later.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Filler persistence in tissues can last 8-10 years, contrary to company claims of 1-year duration [09:16]
- Individual metabolism of hyaluronic acid varies significantly between patients [10:01]
- Fillers can disrupt normal facial anatomy and complicate future surgical procedures [09:16]
- Social media filters and angles can significantly distort facial proportions [06:50]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Avoid following temporary beauty trends [02:10]
- Consider natural-looking enhancements rather than extreme modifications [02:38]
- Be aware that social media images are often filtered and unrealistic [06:29]

Risk Considerations:
- Early use of neurotoxins (e.g., "preventative Botox") is unnecessary for teenagers [06:04]
- Over-volumization with fillers can cause long-term anatomical changes [09:16]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"What you see in terms of images that are on social media a) are filtered, b) are taken with certain angles of the camera to enhance someone's appearance" [06:50]

"Decades later the companies will tell you that filler only lasts one year in the face... that's definitely not true" [09:16]

5. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the long-term health implications of early cosmetic intervention?
2. How can we better educate young people about realistic beauty standards?
3. What are the psychological impacts of social media beauty pressure on adolescents?
4. Are there any studies on the long-term effects of repeated filler use?

Note: This segment focused primarily on social media's impact on beauty standards and cosmetic procedures. The transcript didn't contain significant information about supplements, exercise, nutrition, or biomarkers, so I've omitted those sections from the analysis.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] How much do you see even even just speak about it through the length of your actual careers? How much do you see trends that dramatically change what people are asking for? In other words, Susan, you 25 years ago, did men or women come into your practice significantly looking for something different in terms of an appearance and an outcome that they wanted you to shape? Yeah, I would say that's such a loaded question because 25 years ago, if we think back, there was no social media.

[00:00:35] Yep. Um, television was, you know, very basic. Um, they talked maybe there was some shows that had live people on there on different shows where they would talk about beauty or fashion, but you had to actually tune in and watch those shows to be able to see the trends. Magazines came out and that was the extent of it.

[00:00:57] Now you have social media and various channels on social media and then you have what we now know as influencers and they're changing what our patients are seeing and what's driving them. And the biggest one that I can talk about is basically that very well-known family in California that has monetized their appearance and set a lot of trends for better or for worse. It's great to see that they're making it okay to talk about enhancing your appearance or fixing something that bothers you. But where I draw the line is when they start putting out their transformations.

[00:01:31] And this trend now is something that everyone wants to emulate. And you're talking about young women changing physically changing their body drastically to conform to what you said is a trend which is exactly it. And trends as the word says are not permanent. So what happens when that trend ends? The celebrities have the money to go to the doctors and reverse all that. Now, it will take surgery and they will have scars to show for it or hide for from that. But the patients that follow them, these young women don't have all of that income to go back and then retransform their body and they don't know the implications of that. So,

[00:02:10] I think it's we have a duty as doctors definitely to try to educate our patients about not following trends so strongly and look beyond the monetary aspect of it. And so from that standpoint, I try to really educate my patients to stay away from things that are trending and really do things that make them look and feel better but natural for themselves because um I I don't know in your practice, but I know people want to come in for the enhanced buttocks, the

[00:02:38] Brazilian butt lifts and the small waists and you know that's something again that's being undone by that family now and you're going to see a whole trend that's coming out that doesn't look like that. So what are what are kind of the top above the neck trends? So so what what I see as I look around is I see lip size being something that's getting bigger, smaller, bigger, smaller. Where are we today, by the way, in lip size? So, just to um continue Susan's lines line of thought there, um we're in this again unusual era where the influencers that are affecting society are much more in our faces than they have been historically and they're affecting young people at a much younger age, which is why we just let my 16-year-old daughter have a social media account. Um, and that influence of these influencers is is quite powerful because what happens is on social media, which is the primary exposure that people are receiving these days about beauty, um the the the images that are being posted are not real.

[00:03:42] They're filtered. They're um unrealistic uh exaggerations of some of those three original factors that we're talking about, the symmetry, proportion. People will photograph themselves in such a way where they look they look more proportionate. They will uh you know they'll pull their jaw certain way to make their proportions look uh look better.

[00:04:03] Someone has to teach me how to do this because anytime I see a video of myself, you know, I'm like that is the worst looking thing I've ever seen. Like I need to learn these tricks. You need a 20-year-old. And a lot of this is subconscious posing. That's a term that I have, you know, have used for this concept where people are subconsciously posing like for example, if you like a lot of people when they walk past a shiny building will stop and look at themselves and kind of like adjust themselves a little bit. And by the way, is that new or is that something we would have all like in other words, did our ancestors walk by a stream where the water was still and look at themselves? Do we I mean not that we can know that but possibly I think so but I think the the it's becoming so much more exaggerated now um to the point where we can you know confidently state that social media influencers are selling exaggerated forms of beauty ideals like the sexual dimmorphism. So we talked earlier about like larger lips or bigger eyes. Um, one of the most popular procedures in uh,

[00:05:06] Northeast Asia is surgeries to make the eyes wider. You actually cut into the canthus and perform tossis surgery to make the eye look bigger. And then of course this trend to have bigger lips. Um, you know, fillers are being used left and right unfortunately to overdo lip volume and plump up lips. And because the social media influencers are are posting it, it's becoming more exaggerated because these exaggerated gender traits are becoming normalized.

[00:05:35] And so again, the family that Susan's mentioning in in California, they normalized over overdone lips to the point where people come in asking for it and we have to say, "No, I'm sorry. This is not a good direction for us to take you in." I want to put a bow on the social media thing for a moment. Um, what is the most concerning trend or what is the most concerning request you are getting from people that you believe is sort of unique to to the social media phenomenon?

[00:06:04] What I'm seeing a lot more are teenagers now coming in asking for fillers and neurom modulators in their li in their forehead fillers in their lips and that's sad because but why would I mean would a neurom modulator do anything in when you're at that age anyway? No. But they're now being told that even 18, for example, it's okay to start preventative Botox. You don't need that until you're a lot further along in age.

[00:06:29] So that's just an abject lie that they're being told. Yes. And unfortunately, they're also being made to feel very poorly about their shape of their lips. They're being inundated with images. And like Tanish was saying, these are highly filtered images. We know a lot of people who will take in their waist, take in their thighs, all of that, change the proportions and then post that image.

[00:06:50] And and what I try to tell patients is that what you see in terms of images that are on social media a are filtered, b are taken um with certain angles of the camera to enhance someone's appearance. And we will never, at least in my practice, take someone's photo that they took on their phone and then try to enhance them to look like their photo because what's happening is that you're going to make them look very different in life in real life. So how you photograph, you're only going to photograph beautifully if you're the most symmetric person. And that's why even the most beautiful model on in a photograph, if you look at them in person, they're very pretty, but you wouldn't think that they're super models sometimes. But when they photograph, they photograph beautifully because of their symmetry. But for us with our forward- facing cameras um that we point at ourselves to take uh our selfies, they're going to distort our face. If you tilt one way, you elongate the face.

[00:07:48] Tilt a different way, you shorten the face. And patients get hung up on that. And that's really sad because in real life, they look fabulous. Now, is this a 955 female male problem that is is arising from social media or are there are there are and is the I I I guess from the purpose of this discussion, I would guess it's mostly female. My guess is the male issue is probably much more on anabolic steroid abuse and things that that young men are being influenced by. Is that safe to assume? So, so what is it that you see tenuous that is most disconcerting? Is there a particular product or particular procedure that is that is showing up that is would have been unheard of before social media?

[00:08:28] I would say two areas. One is because fillers are non-surgical, relatively accessible price points and um low risk and are ubiquitous. You can find a clinic within one mile if you live in a major city. I think overfilling is a serious problem. um whether it's the lips or the cheeks over over volumization has become an epidemic and and it's and it's it's a serious problem not only because it looks exaggerated and distorted and strange but even when as a facial surgeon I go in to perform surgeries I will find that filler has disrupted normal anatomy and so decades later the companies will tell you that filler only lasts one year in the face and you have to refill it.

[00:09:16] That's definitely not true. Really, we see I have patients coming in who don't mention that they've had fillers in the past, but then in surgery, I will see filler in their cheek or in their face because they had it eight or 10 years ago and it's still there. And it's stretching the ligaments. It's changing the structure of the tissues. It actually makes routine surgical procedures later more challenging. So, that's one that's one area.

[00:09:40] And by the way, are there biologic features of the individual that would make that more or less true? Are there some people in whom fillers go away after a year or are you saying that for the most part they last longer? That's also another whole complex topic is the metabolism of hyaluronic acid and some people are higher metabolizers, some are slower metabolizers and we actually don't have a good sense of that.

[00:10:01] We have some general concepts just based on experience but there's very little science on that. We can't really predict who's So one doesn't know. One really doesn't know. Okay. And I'm sorry you were going to get to a second point. Yeah. No. Uh the second point is from a surgical standpoint there is a trend right now where people are asking for this high arched brow effect where it's a hyperexaggerated the tail of the brow comes up very high. It's called a snatched look. About once every week or two I've got someone who seriously wants to have their face distorted with a surgical procedure with me and I have to say I'm sorry we're not going to do that. Is it safe to say that anyone who walks into a physician's office to do this needs to be able to be over 18 to provide consent?

[00:10:46] But is it safe to say or is it is it is it the case that people younger than 18 can do this in less reputable uh places without parent consent? Do we know this? It should be 18. It's like any other medical procedure. You have to be 18 years of age to consent. There are rare instances where where I will treat someone who's 16 or 17 if the parent is there and if it's for something for example a patient has a hump on their nose that they don't like but they're not ready to commit to a rhinoplasty so

[00:11:21] I can use fillers in a creative way to help reduce the appearance of that but that's very but again the point is the parent is there yes absolutely I did have a very interesting incident where I had an 18-year-old though come in and she had just had a rhinoplasty and was coming to see me for fillers and for neurom modulators and I asked her I said you're 18 um is someone here with you from one of your parents and nobody was there with her and the interesting thing is though um she is 18 thinking that she's an adult but she's only a junior in high school so I was very conflicted I I kept referring going back to the something along the lines of you need to talk to your parents. You need to tell them what we discussed here. That really bothered me for a long time that here's this 18-year-old who's still in high school that wants to do things and I don't see a parent there with her.

[00:12:19] But I think I think it's not a huge problem probably across the board that people under 18 are getting treatments, but they're getting fed all of this societal pressure. Um I like to use the term beauty pressure. They're getting all like like peer pressure. It's beauty pressure that's now more extreme because of social media. They're getting all this beauty pressure at a very young age, 12, 13 onwards. And so by the time they get into their 20s, they've been thinking about this for years and years and years, and they're ready to dive into it.
