Bestselling author Michael Easter returns to The Drive to discuss his new book, Scarcity Brain. In this episode, Michael explores the evolutionary backdrop that molded human beings, a setting characterized by scarce food, limited information, and few possessions. He contrasts that with the modern era, marked by abundance and comfort, and the ensuing repercussions on our physical and mental well-being. Michael introduces the concept of the “scarcity loop,” a three-part behavior cycle which helps explain modern challenges such as overeating, addiction, gambling, and materialism, and offers practical strategies to break free from its cycle. The episode culminates in a thought-provoking exploration of happiness, drawing on Michael's experiences with monks and underscoring the value of boredom, exploration, and discomfort as transformative elements that elevate awareness, presence, and the will to live.

[00:00:00] when you think about the context your point of how humans evolved we live like that all the time cuz we didn't know where our next meal might come from very often we didn't know what the weather would bring we didn't know what was happening next and we were having to really work and uh struggle to survive and there is probably something rewarding to that and to be in the moment and to have to work to get the things that you get really on a deep level and be just kind of in it like you are in it you know and um yeah so I think that the takeaway for the average person is how is not to go to Baghdad let me say that it is how can you do things in your life that maybe reflect that a little bit hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:54] AA Michael thanks for making the trip to Austin yeah thanks for having me again it's good to be here and congrats on on the uh on the book well thank you very much and congrats on yours thanks so much so last time we were here we were talking about the Comfort crisis which is a book people have heard me talk about over and over and over again it's it's on the short list of books you know

[00:01:13] I I recommend uh regularly um but I want to kind of understand how you went from the obvious success of the Comfort crisis and more importantly the lessons you learned in the comfort crisis to thinking about the particular problem that feeds into scarcity brain yeah so I finished the Comfort crisis basically right as the pandemic was taking off so March 2020 now when the pandemic takes off what does everyone do they go to the grocery store and they hoard as much stuff as they can right we're going to get all the canned food we have we can get we're going to get all the toilet paper we're going to get all the hand sanitizer this a rational decision at that point but it made me sort of realize oh when when we think that resources are scarce our reaction is to hoard them and gather them right and I think what was interesting about the pandemic is you had this initial spike in that sort of behavior but then sort of as it uh Drew out you saw everything from drinking and drug use increase you saw purchasing increase you saw a lot of people gain weight eating food and exercising less and so you saw all these behaviors um that can be damaged and just sort of increase over time and so that made me sort of Wonder uh about questions of scarcity how it affects us um how our environments have changed because that's what the Comfort crisis is ultimately about and one of the elements underlying that is that we do live in a world where we have an abundance of all these things we're built to Crave and managing that can be difficult you know I was thinking about where to start because there are so many sections in this book Each of which dive into seemingly disperate topics uh of scarcity right well and we'll talk about them all right we'll talk about scarcity of information scarcity of food um but maybe we start with food because I think it is the most obvious one at least to me um also it's the one for which there is the most obvious evolutionary link um now there are Scholars out there who would argue that the greatest superpower of the homo sapiens uh are their ability to tell stories and i' I've I've heard this said and and that makes sense um maybe it's just own bias in biology but

[00:03:32] I've always felt that our superpower as Homo sapiens was energy storage um and it's probably the case that there are many superpowers that we have that that coales around um where we are today and how we kind of leap frogged ahead of every other species about 250,000 years ago um so let's talk a little bit about what we know about scarcity with respect to nutrition and how that evolved us as a species yeah well I mean in the past re until very recently food was scarce and it was hard to find I mean especially prehistorically there wasn't a lot of food not to mention in order to get it you know you weren't going down to the 7-Eleven it was uh you would have to hunt you would have to gather you'd have to put in energy to get energy and you know we know it wasn't always easy to come by it kind of depended on where you lived obviously um but recently in the grand scheme of time and space within the last 100 years we've been able to produce really an abundance of food and we've engineered our food to be as delicious as possible and we have so much food now that the average person in America or

[00:04:43] America as a whole we throw out about a third of the food that we produce so we've gone from being these creatures who evolved to because food was scarce and hard to find if you had the opportunity to eat it maybe eat a little more than you needed at any given time that would give you a survival Advantage because you could store that energy and then the next time that you can't find food you're going to survive that um we still have that drive to eat a little more than we need but we live in a world where food is rarely scarce right so it's a evolutionary mismatch basically you know I don't know if you've heard me talk about the default food environment we were talking about it a minute ago effectively in the pantry exam you know we were both you know talking to each other about the challenges of our pantries and this is I kind of talked to my patients about is the default food environment right so when you're um when you're changing a habit that requires subtraction to me the strategy is changing the environment when you're changing a habit that requires addition there's a whole different strategy but um the default food environment is as you said it's incredibly palatable incredibly calorie dense uh incredibly non-perishable and therefore portable uh and Incredibly cheap so if you just think about dollar per kogle it's you can't fathom how remarkable this is and by the way you know I don't believe that any of that is particularly nefarious on the part of

[00:06:11] Industry I think it's solving a problem yes and the solution happen to produce you know those those things that we now have that meet those criteria and it's just that one of the criteria that wasn't on the list there's not a fifth criteria that is like healthy right like make it such that if you consumed it at any level it would not harm you that is obviously not one of the criteria so um what do we know about the most contentious topic of them all which is what is at the root of the Obesity crisis because while people can debate that there's really no debate at the state of our excess nutrition um so I mean I'll let you give the stats but we are an overnourished species at this point um that even globally the state of overnourishment exceeds that of malnourishment yeah so 40 some percent of Americans are now obese that number is expected to climb um and globally too I believe that diseases that stem from overnourishment outweigh those that stem from overnourishment by about fourfold yeah

[00:07:29] Nish yeah and so you know to your point this is a good problem to have cuz literally for all of time um your job was getting food every day and preparing it right so a great example is um before we created production lines to make tortillas Mexican women used to spend five hours a day hand grinding corn to make tortillas right when we get in um food production lines and we sort of um start to process our food more that frees up a lot of time for people it makes food more abundant it makes it easier to come by it makes it cheaper so today I think the average American spends about 8% of their income on food in the past we used to spend more than 40% so it's a eight versus 40 eight versus 40 so think about that right um so this is a good problem to have but we now have so much food that it be it does become hard to manage and you know as you've talked about plenty on this podcast obesity is linked to so many of the diseases now that end up cutting Our

[00:08:37] Lives short and not only that um they cut into our health span right they make us immobile um and I think that that leads to some Downstream consequences like depression anxiety and so um it really is it becomes pernicious over time and the one of the issues is that food will always be rewarding in the short term right it's a hard battle to fight so I have a lot of empathy for people who um are obese you know um I understand that it's it's very challenging because we do live in a food environment where you can make that decision for that thing that's going to um be delicious feel good in the short term but it is um too much of it can cause some long-term problems so when you wanted to look into this question you did something that I think is very interesting and folks when they read the book I think will be particularly intrigued by this section where you decided to go and live with some hunter gatherers now there aren't that many hunter gatherers left and usually when we talk about them we think of the hza because so much attention has been sort of thrown their way but you went to a different group in Bolivia the chumani correct yeah I I hadn't even heard of this group of hunter gatherers until I read the book so um how did you find them how did you select them over some of the ones that could have been a lot easier to reach again such as the Hodo yeah so I came across this uh paper and

[00:10:05] I believe it was 2018 and it basically found that this tribe does not get heart disease so when you look at you know what kills the average person it's heart disease that's the number one killer of Americans it's the number one killer worldwide so I go okay what's going down there what's let's see what's going on there because the other thing that I think is important is when you look at what people actually worry about healthwise it's not heart disease not it's cancer people worry about cancer people worry about terrorism they worry about violence right so you'll have people who stock you know tons and tons of guns and bullets because they don't want to get killed and yet they've also got a pantry full of junk food and it's like well maybe we should think about that too um so I read this paper I talked to the two researchers on it and

[00:10:51] I decided I'm going to go down there you know I want to see it for myself because uh my background is I'm a journalist and I'm an investigative journalist so I travel places to meet with people to see what's going on there get my eyes on on the world so I fly into the Paw go to the source go to the source as as as one of your editors might have said yes yes um so I fly into laa um then we take a 12-hour car ride down to a town called rabake in Bolivia and from there we get in a canoe it's called a pek pek boat so they these long boats are like 30t really thin and they've got these motors on them they're called longtail motor we take that about six hours up a feeder River of the

[00:11:33] Amazon and it was hilarious because you know all you can see is Jungle the entire time like it's all green it all looks the same and then the the boat driver just you know eventually pulls over and you're going how did he know how did you know you know and he's up this is it get out you know um yeah and there they were and they're fascinating

[00:11:54] I think because they're not true Hunter gathers they do a lot of um so they're Hunter horticulturalists I guess you consider them so what was interesting with them is that you know at some point in the given day because you sort of brought up how we've had all these fad diets over the last x amount of years at some point in the day they're going to offend some fat diet right so they eat meat uh they eat plain white rice their diet isn't necessarily lowfat it's not necessarily low carb um they're eating things like corn right that's off limits in so many diet books but the commonality behind their food is that it all has one ingredient so they're basically not getting access to ultra processed food and um that seems to be one of the key reasons they've been able to avoid disease I mean they're not and tell me about the population so how many folks are there yeah so I believe there are 20,000 that might be a high number um might be five 5 to 20,000 spread throughout the Amazon um the Bolivian

[00:12:58] Amazon on but the tri the group that I went and saw there's about 50 of them in a small village and what does the distribution of their lifespan look like in other words um what is median survival because I imagine there's a skew down on median based on no access to antibiotics and the things that we take for granted here where what I call medicine 2.0 has done a remarkable job of extending human lifespan right so when I asked um I had a guide who was from another tribe take me up there and

[00:13:31] I said all right great they don't you know they don't die of heart disease they don't die of Alzheimer's what do they die of and he just go oh accidents it's accidents it's uh snakes like literally there's snakes out there that if you get bit you're you're screwed um I think they live into their 70s on average if if they're manag to Sid step a you know a snake or some other accident and then the claim that they don't have coronary artery disease explain how that how that claim has been uh validated yeah so they um put them in a boat this guy that I talked to this researcher they got a bunch of the tribe members and they took them into the village to do uh CT scans of their heart and so they basically didn't have a lot of the markers that they look for in that scan yeah so they're doing these CT angiograms on folks in their 70s and I believe as you described it they looked like healthy 50y olds is that about the the time I believe it was about they looked uh their hearts looked about 30 years younger 30 years younger Okay so we've got these folks and they at least on the basis of what I refer to as the four horsemen they don't seem to get the four horsemen and eventually they're going to die because of these other problems um there are a lot of things that are different for them right so one could say Well they're probably not under chronic stress they're probably quite active they probably have a really good circadian rhythm and sleep well and they don't have electronics and obviously they eat a very different diet how much do you think this different diet which I want you to go into a little more detail on because you even attempted to follow it for some time how much do you think the diet played a role in this given that we can't answer that question prospectively yeah I think it plays a pretty large factor of course it's not everything now one of the reasons I think this is because there is another tribe called the mosa 10 who I spend a little bit of time with they're only an hour from the village so they will go into town they'll get Ultra processed food they'll get things like oil and they will fry their plantains right the the chiman are baking them in a fire they're just not um doing all these things that make the food a lot more appealing and in turn lead them to overeat um the Mosen seem to have uh elevated risk of heart disease according to the scientists I talk to so let's go back to what these folks eat go through what the Chim eat because you describe it as they're eating tons of meat they're eating tons of carbs they're eating tons of plants as you said they're kind of violating every

[00:16:09] Cult of diet out there yeah they they absolutely are so I would say in the average uh day so for breakfast it's probably something like white rice maybe some plantains with some protein it could be fish it could be chicken it could be um they hunt a Amazonian deer called a taper so that's a red meat for lunch very similar pile of white rice maybe some fish little bit of vegetables so one thing that was interesting too is that they're not eating a ton of vegetables right so if if you and I go to you know sweet greens salad chain or whatever like that single salad that we would get there is probably the amount of vegetables we're eating across the day in the way we think of vegetables like greens cabbage things like that and then for dinner it's the same deal it's more carbs it's sweet potatoes it's maybe some meat it's a fish and it's just very simple uh Foods repeated over and over and over and that's I think what it was probably like for humans for most of time you know one of the fascinating things about today is that we have more options for food to eat than ever before I mean think of your average grocery store it's got like 10,000 things that you can choose from right but uh and that is very new in the grand scheme of time and space and I think that uh we haven't necessarily learned to navigate that well so we do know that that the more options people have to eat the more things they can eat the more that person will eat so this is a term the buffet effect you've alluded to there's um a real raging debate within the Obesity

[00:17:42] Community where so many interesting theories are put forth um and it might be that no one theory is wholly complete so obviously one theory is food availability it's simply the quantity of food that is available um and there are certainly examples of where that seems to work but then there are other counter examples where you can find in places of either high or low food availability you get the opposite to what you would expect based on the theory you talk about palatability food today is hyper palatable and again there are plenty of examples this being one of them where hyper palatability or lack thereof seems to play a role obviously you then get into its carbs it's fats it's this it's that it's the other thing um where do you think pleasure from eating fits into this landscape in other words anybody listening to this takes for granted I think uh we all take for granted the idea that like eating is often very pleasurable because we have

[00:18:45] Choice like I don't know I'm going to decide what I'm going to eat today if I'm at a buffet or even if I'm at home or if I'm at a restaurant ordering something I'm going to presumably order something that I enjoy eating do you get the sense that they enjoy eating I couldn't tell you that to be honest I will tell you that as someone coming from here's how I answer that actually as someone coming from the US and Las Vegas by the way which Buffet is everywhere um their food was not enjoyable it's very very very plain they're not salting it you're eating plantains that have been baked in a fire the fish is just you know they cook it up and it is what it is what is I I I've never consumed fish without at least putting salt on it what does it taste like it's just like flaky it's just flaky unsalted fish yeah interesting and the chicken as well one thing that was fascinating is that their chickens are also um much different than ours because

[00:19:48] I bet our chickens have been bred to be giant right like they they could never live out in the wild the chickens that we have in the big um plants in the US their chickens are wild chicken they weigh like 3 lb and there's not much meat on them and the meat that is on them tough it's very tough it's very stringy I mean you know I took a bite

[00:20:08] I'm like oh yeah we're we're not in Las Vegas anymore and um yeah it's I mean it's not that uh enjoyable comparatively so food is so eating is a is a is a is a thing you do because you need to do it yes you you do it because you need to do it now at the same time you know I I know that they're not having access to Las Vegas buffet so for them is it like oh this is pretty good like that could very well be how long did it take if at all for your taste buds to downregulate and for you to be like you know I can actually taste the sweetness in this plantain and these sweet potatoes really are kind of a step up in sweetness from the plain rice or whatever like did did you did you go through this desensitization or rather resensitization as you stayed with them yeah I think so I think you start to enjoy it more and it could just be that you're hungry now right you've come from you've come from the city where you've had all this great food and now you're shuttled into this to this world and your first meal is you're going okay I'm just going to have a little bit of this because it doesn't taste good and then all of a sudden you know you do that for a few days you go okay well I'm actually hungry now I got to eat and uh I do feel like hunger is the best sauce right if you're hungry a lot can taste good if you're deprived of something and then you get it becomes more enjoyable what about um any so so here in the US of course or in the developed World any one of us myself included who's thinking about their weight is kind of playing this game of how much should I eat and you know there are all these great you know sort of models like well you know always get up from the table when you're still a little bit hungry or really you know try you know count your calories or limit your carbs or limit your fat or you know what we always always have like kind of heuristics that we try to use to regulate caloric balance do they do any such thing or do they literally eat as much as they want of these Bland foods but their off switch just comes so much sooner because presumably nothing in their brain is being hijacked yeah so there I'll answer that with this there was an interesting study from Kevin Hall at the NIH and they basically took a group of people in for two weeks um they fed them a diet that was processed food I love this study by the way oh it's fantastic so great kin and Kevin was a real skeptic going into this study I think it's worth maybe giving a little bit of background that's a great point so a group from

[00:22:39] Brazil had basically come out and said that you know one of the reasons uh for the Obesity crisis is because of uh the food is ultra processed there the nature of the ultra processing itself is leading people to eat more so he calls him up and he goes you know what evidence do you have like why do you think that and sort to interrupt but just to make sure the list understands cuz you and I know Kevin very well um

[00:23:01] Kevin's an empiricist whose view is to the best of his knowledge based on his data and Kevin generally has access to the most controlled studies because he runs a metabolic Ward right it's the energy content of the food that is driving weight gain yes and it is independent of the quality of the food yes so a th000 calories of broccoli is as fattening as a th000 calories of potato chips yes so he calls them up and he you know he says basically that and he goes so why do you think that and they go well Ultra processed food has more it's got more sugar it's got more salt and he goes well you just named all these macronutrients like you can't say that and that doesn't make any sense so what he decides to do is he's going to study this see if there's any there there CU he's a skeptic right so takes this group of people uh for for two weeks they eat a uh they were kind of differentiated but for first two weeks they eat a Ultra processed diet for the next two weeks they eat a diet that is matched for everything carbs salt all that uh for the other two weeks but this food is minimally processed so it's a minimally processed version of the diet so for example on one night of the ultr process diet you might be getting you know like swans and meatloaf with the with the uh mashed potatoes that have the butter and all that kind of stuff uh on the unprocessed night that version might be cut of beef you know some plain potatoes that sort of thing and what he finds is that when and just to be clear I believe you could it was an ad lib feed study yes you the the participant eats as much of the food as they want they're not being restricted correct so he's telling them eat as much as you want until feel full and what he finds is that when people are on the uh Ultra processed diet they end up eating about 500 more calories a day and they start to gain weight when they're on the minimally processed diet they eat less and they start to spontaneously lose weight and so I think one of the reasons for this uh obviously there's a lot of potential reasons but I think one of the things that he thinks is that uh speed becomes a factor so when you process a food to the extent that it becomes you know an ultr processed food I.E a junk food uh it becomes a lot faster to eat and you simply uh end up eating more of it and there's more triggers to continue eating more of it because it is so hyper palatable and enjoyable this leads to the three V's of snacking yes right so I talked to a uh a guy who's with the food industry and he says if you want to get a snack food to sell it's got to have 3vs it's got to have value so it's got to be relatively affordable it's got to have variety meaning there's got to be a variety of flavors the flavors have to be intense and oh by the way if you're making one just one snack food that's not a good that's not a good idea don't make just one original Pringles make 20

[00:26:15] Pringles make barbecue Pringles make sour cream Pringles on and on and on right there's all this different varieties and then uh three the third V is velocity it has to be fast to eat so sacking was not a sort of cultural thing until about 1970 and once people start to really snack I mean this becomes this is a concerted Movement by the food industry to go okay uh how do we sell more food right well let's invent this category called snacking and once you see snacking start to take off I think you really start to see the rise in obesity in our country and then have it trickle out across the world in 1970 yeah it's kind of amazing to think that only 50 years ago this this concept which seems so ingrained in how we live I mean you can't really go anywhere like think about every time you're on an airplane there's like a snack basket like everywhere you go there are snacks there are snacks yeah and so uh and there's a I think there's a lesson in that right and so when you think about okay well if I'm trying to eat less how can I do that well I think that the lessons from the chimane suggest and there's other research that back us backs us up is that foods that are minimally processed easy way to think about that is are ingredients rather than have ingredients um they cut the brakes that sort of lead people to overeat meaning it's a lot slower to eat uh foods that are unprocessed so let's go back to your uh the example of the you know 1,000 calories of brownie versus 1,000 calories of broccoli yes those two things might make you equally fat but I would love to watch a person try and eat 1,000 calories of broccoli it's never going to happen it just takes up so much volume in your stomach it's slow to eat whereas with a brownie I mean I've eaten a thousand calories of brownie before right I mean it's it's relatively easy to do and there's I could do it right now enjoy we can do it after this podcast yeah no no I I I I um you know I get asked all the time about the carnivore diet right and and people sort of say what do what do you think of this does this really work and

[00:28:22] I said look as someone who's never done it but who thinks about this problem a lot it doesn't really surprise me that if a person were limited to ribe eyes and they couldn't eat a single other thing but ribey despite how calorically dense a ribeye is and it's right at the top of calorically dense foods yeah I can totally see how a person would lose weight now if you said well it's ribe eyes plus baked potatoes plus you know this plus this plus this and that's all

[00:28:50] I'm going to eat well at some point it becomes a little bit comical so um yeah like I think if if you were stuck eating one food for the rest of your life you would wither away regardless of what that food is and by the way that might even apply to something as ridiculous as ice cream um and uh conversely if you want to make that even more extreme if you want to increase the number of food choices you have to pull a different knob or dial a different lever the other way which is okay then you have to dial down the processing right yeah um exactly so so you so I mean I just this story and then you go home and you decide you're going to give this a shot it's like the diet with no name yeah so I hang out with uh this tribe for a while learn from them observe what they're eating fish with them just hang out great people go back to uh Las Vegas and I decide uh okay I'm going to try this for a month I'm going to see what happens so literally it's every food that I eat has to have just one ingredient I got to mimic as closely as I can what they're eating so what just tell me this when you go home how many foods in your pantry and refrigerator already fit that description oh there there's like eight

[00:30:04] Foods in the pantry that probably has 200 items that fit this right I've got like some apples in there so your pantry is as bad as mine yeah I've got some plain rice I've got you know but even things that I think people would normally maybe consider healthy like whole wheat bread flip that over it's like wow that's a long list of stuff um so I end up going to Costco to try and solve for this problem and I'm walking aisles and there's literally entire aisles that are just off limits right so you're left with a very basic diet every single day in the morning I might eat something like oatmeal I might eat uh some eggs with that at lunch I might air fry some plantains and have um some fish at dinner uh I would have maybe a sweet potato with some green beans and um you know luckily we both hunt uh some elk and I will tell you it was not as exciting as my normal diet at the same time I started dumping weight pretty fast and I didn't necessarily want to lose weight so I all of a sudden had to go okay if I want to stay at it's 180 pounds about if I want to stay you know at least at 175 I'm going to have to up my choric intake oh my gosh that it became so much food you were Force feeding yourself I was force feeding myself yes so one day for example I'm like okay I'm trying to do some rough math in my head of you know calories I'm going okay we're going to need amount of plantains get them there and it's just it's a mountain you know and uh it becomes tough to eat all that food by the way did you restrict yourself in any other way did you not snack deliberately like if you or were you just never hungry between meals if I wanted a snack

[00:31:42] I would usually just have a piece of fruit so there you know the jungle out there is filled with fruit I will say that was the one food they had that was good so they had pretty good fruit out there yeah it was fantastic um so I got to say Michael like that doesn't sound like an impossible to follow diet if you have control of your food environment where I think a diet like that becomes challenging is the moment you venture out of your own preparation bubble I.E the moment you go to someone's house for dinner or the moment you go to a restaurant so how did you navigate those situations yeah that was that was absolutely challenging um the reality is is I couldn't be perfect then right if my neighbor invites me over and says hey we're making you dinner I'm not going to walk in and be like okay well I got this food list from this going to be that guy this tribe in the Amazon please yeah just uh you know fry me up some plantains air fry though only air fry um so I wasn't going to do that so I would just kind of do the best I could you know if it's a cookout they're going to have like some grilled chicken they might have some I don't know like potatoes or something I would just do my best do you have a sense of what your

[00:32:41] Macros broke down into heavier on the carbs so these people what were you roughly 50 carbs yeah more than 50% carbs I would say 50 to 50 to 60 at least yeah could have been up into the 70 some days and what else did you have for protein besides fish elk oh that's right you mentioned elk but when you would you season the elk uh sometimes I I'm not going to lie sometimes I would put some salt on that

[00:33:06] Peter and and do you think that that's violating I mean again there's no principle here we trying to adhere to but do you think that that changed your repetitive Behavior because that's effectively what we're trying to get makes it it makes it easier to eat yeah and if something's easier to eat you're going to eat more of it so now apply that to you know how much we how much protein are you able to eat per day cuz that's I mean the eggs would be a good way to get protein but I mean as much as

[00:33:31] I love meat I really like to have salt and pepper on it yeah well I think that sometimes we discount how much protein comes from grains depending on what the Grain and we often discount that so if I'm having a giant bowl of oatmeal in the morning I mean that might have 18 20 grams right there and so that starts to you can't mix it with anything you're not going to put even you wouldn't even put berries on the oatmeal I would sometimes put berries on the so that doesn't violate the rule yeah no we we all got one ingredient here so I see so it's all single ingredients that can be mix together yeah yeah exactly um so again I kind of want to try this oh you should try it dude I guarantee one thing that was interesting is I followed up with a buddy whose name is um Trevor cashy oh yeah you wrote about Trevor in the first book yeah he was in the comfort crisis brilliant guy he's a uh biochemist and he ended up getting into nutrition and you know I said told him about what was happening and he said um basically a lot of good things can happen too that even if you have a very lowlevel allergy to a food that you're not aware of by cutting out um a lot of the foods I did it could be too that you know maybe I was to some extent allergic to a food and I wasn't aware of it and that helped me you know lose weight or might have made me end up feeling better or something like that so I think that there's a lot of things um a lot of good things that can come out of a project like that and the reality is is like would I tell anyone to eat that exact way the rest of their life and never violate that no do I think that something like that is worth trying so you can learn okay these are some foods that seem to work for me I I tend to feel more full on fewer calories when

[00:35:13] I'm eating foods like this and then from there you can go okay like I have a general plan that's going to be like I'm going to eat like this 80 90% of the time whatever it might be uh and then you know we do live in a world where it's amazing in the sense that you can we can sit down and have that thousand calories of brownies right if I bring a th000 calories of brownies to the jamman they're going to be like oh my God this is amazing they're going to eat it right and so I'm not saying that we should never eat Ultra processed food I think the the question is how do we manage that right because we do live in a world where it's incredible that we can have brownies that we can have 15 different flavors of Doritos it's all great but if we are eating those Foods too often all the time that becomes the brunt of our diet I mean we know we're going to have issues and I think that um I believe a lot of the research suggests that anywhere from 60 to 70% of American diet is ultra processed so you start to look at that and go okay we've got snacking we've got people eating Ultra processed food for most of the foods they're eating and I think it start to make sense why you see scales start to get higher over time do you have a sense of why some people are more or less immune to those effects um there are some people who even when presented with ultra-processed food don't eat to excess and yet there are others and I would put myself far on this scale where it's the only way I'm not going to eat two excess in the in the um in the setting of hyper palatable hyper processed food is enormous self-discipline when I can manage to exert it which is not always and probably not all not most of the time in other words I have to use hack and tricks to get around it whereas I know people who can sit in front of a plate of freshly made cookies and eat one yeah while the entire plate sits there in front of them for the next hour yeah that's a that's a really good question um I don't think there's a perfect answer I do think sometimes food can be used for things other than nutrition for example stress relief things like that um emotions dealing with emotions I I do think you tend to see um especially today um people eat for emotional reasons right there was a study that I had in the comfort crisis that uh suggested that 80% of eating today is driven by reasons other than true hunger and so there's a lot of lot of things it could be it's a certain time a day but I think uh or you know food is around so you just eat it but I do think that stress eating is a thing that works like eating food will solve your stress in the short and where do you think that comes from in the sense that cuz let's go I want to talk about the scarcity Loop we haven't it we're going talk about what the scarcity Loop but there are some people like I could walk into a casino which we going talk about gambling it wouldn't even occur to me to play a slot machine like it wouldn't the thought wouldn't cross my mind I would just look at that and think why would I ever want to waste a dollar like it and I I say that not with any judgment on those who have destroyed their lives at slot machines but that doesn't I mean I don't like I would if you said to me you could play the slot machine or watch the paint dry on the wall I'd be like well at least I don't have to pay to watch the paint dry um so so there are but yet there are some addictions such as food that I will struggle with indefinitely um and we could go through the list there are some people who you know drugs you know whether it be that first time they take a painkiller it puts a hook into them that is very difficult for them to escape alcohol same thing like never occurs to me to get get drunk and I know obviously you're sober so clearly for you alcohol scratched and itch that it's never scratched for me and I feel very grateful for that in other words I don't think there's a moral difference between us I think there's like a biochemical difference do you have a sense of why each of us have different vulnerabilities when it comes to the scarcity Loop that's a great question I think um I don't know if that I mean you might know but I don't think there's a specific answer like why do people why do you like F1 and I like basketball right it's who knows but I do think that probably exposure um during vulnerable periods sort of sets the table so for example um here's a here's a good example from addiction research if a uh person drinks at 15 or younger they have a coin flips chance of becoming an alcoholic if they drink uh after 21 21 or- Old older they have a 10% chance and so why is that it's because your brain is developing such a way from the from puberty till you're about 25 where you're trying to figure out okay how do

[00:40:05] I find Comfort how do I navigate the world how do I deal with stress how do I deal with my problems and so I think that that sort of gets set in with alcohol for example that gets set in at that age and you go oh this thing this is what works for me right so it could be maybe the young age like food worked for you to help you deal deal with your problems for me it was like you know I first time I drank when I was like 15

[00:40:28] I'm like wow the world's way better after this right it was like a very deep learning experience that's so interesting I remember reading that and thinking of my first time drinking which was 13 but I drank so much it was funny I worked at my dad's restaurant it was New Year's Eve I was a bus boy and at the end of the night I went around and drank all of the remaining drinks on the table oh no of everything that was there including this is back when you could even have a can of beer and I'm pouring it out and like cigarette butts are coming out and I'm drinking the beer like and I got so drunk that not only did I vomit throughout the night I was drunk the next day oh wow is it just the case that that was such an unpleasant experience versus you know your experience and by the way you know recently Matthew Perry died and I remember reading an article about him where he talked about the first time he drank and I think he said you know he started drank a bottle of wine laid in a field and was like this is the greatest feeling in the world so that made me think that maybe it comes down to not just age of exposure but the reward that comes from that exposure and maybe you know if there if there's no reward and in fact there's a punishment physiologically it could have the opposite effect yeah I think so I mean I think you learn that this thing is good right you do this thing oh that was a good outcome I'm going to do that again cuz I want that good thing again whereas with you your exposure to alcohol was okay I did this thing wow that was terrible I'm not going to do that again right it's for you it's like putting your hand on the stove yeah o not doing that ever again for me it was like I flipped on the stove and this amazing five course best meal of my life appeared and it was like wow I'm going to be touching that stove button to get that to happen again so I think it's it's very much just a learned behavior that we I mean that's how humans humans learn that's why we do what we do because we get rewarded for it right and so I think it um just sort of gets set in particularly at a at a young age and um you know and it could be that by the time going back to that study by the time you're 21 well you figured out these other ways to navigate the world what you get rewards from and so if you've waited until 21 you're like well

[00:42:42] I have all these other things that give me rewards yeah you you you figured out other self- soothing tools yeah so let's now talk about the scarcity Loop there are three components to it and these three components get exploited in our lives everywhere we go yeah what what are they and how do they feed off each other yeah I mean so for context the reason that I started thinking about this is that I live in

[00:43:09] Las Vegas and in Vegas I mean you talked about your experience with slot machines well not everyone in Vegas feels the way you do about slot Ma and I and I again I don't say that with any judgment or moral superiority I truly believe there's a biological difference between me and that person in Vegas who could throw their life away yeah totally I agree so I basically make the observation that one you have to realize that slot machines are all over Las

[00:43:34] Vegas they're in the grocery stores they're in the gas stations they're in uh the restaurants the bars they're in the airport and people play them all the time and so when I go down to the gas station to you know fill up my truck and and get a Diet Coke I'll see people in there at you know 7: a.m. playing the slot machine and I see that and I go why would anyone do that it doesn't make any sense because everyone knows the house always wins and by the way when the house wins in blackjack and poker it's only slightly right it's like you know it's 5149 right what is the ex how how much does the house win in slot machines so it's actually not super super far off of those odds so in the past slot machines used to be they call them one-arm Bandits because the case was that they were one-armed Bandits now I believe that uh slot machines are about return about 85 cents for every dollar you spend on average so um so I see this which is smart for reasons you're going to explain yeah we'll we'll get in we'll get into why that works and why once they shifted from not giving people frequent wins and rewards to more frequent wins and rewards why slot machines took off so I make this observation about slot machines and I start wondering okay how does a slot machine work how can this thing get people to be down at the 7-Eleven and sit for hours and hours and play this thing where you know you're going to lose play it long enough you're going to lose it's just how it works so I go into journalist mode and what was fascinating is the first people that I call are people who are I would guess I would term them um they're gambling researchers but they have a very anti-gambling bent okay so they're looking at okay here's all the reasons why gambling hurts us here's why people get hooked on slot machines and I call them up and I talk to these people and they tell me all sorts of things that um are kind of like the myths you hear about casinos right so uh one person said uh slot machines only play in the key of C and the key of C is very pleasing to people and it uh relaxes their wallet you know relaxes them and then turn their wallets another person tells me oh casinos don't use right angles because right angles activate the decision-making part of your brain and that'll slow down your rate of gambling all these different things another one was casinos don't have clocks so you lose track of time did you hear the one about how casinos inject oxygen into the air to I don't know why that would make you want to gamble more but I remember hearing that they're pumping oxygen into the room also known as the biggest fire hazard ever known to man yeah exactly yeah so I go okay like sounds good but the problem is is I live in Las Vegas and I got a casino like two x's for me so I go into the casino uh no they don't have clocks but like neither does Costco neither does Walmart neither does any normal business that we we don't just hang clocks everywhere I don't have one in here by the way I don't know if you noticed right well you're trying to man manipulate me somehow am trying to get you to play a slot machine uh the right angles thing slot machine screens are a square that is right angles right and then I call up a slot machine audio composer who lives in Vegas it's a real job you can have in that town and uh he goes where did you hear that I use all keys you know I'm just trying to make the best little jingle that I can I'm just trying to have fun um so I realized that my inherent problem is that I am talking to people who want us all to stop gambling and I need to talk to the people who want us to start gambling right I got to follow the money on this thing so long story short is through um some different contacts I end up at this place on the edge of town in Vegas and it's this new Cutting Edge Casino um but it is not fully open to the public like a normal Casino would be it is used uh it's a casino laboratory so it's used entirely for research on human behavior and the people invested in this are gambling companies so big gambling companies um like Boyd Caesars whatever all the big names um but also a lot of tech companies so there's 73 different companies that are invested in this place and it is it is very much like a

[00:47:34] Twilight Zone of casinos you walk into this place and you're like I in I'm in a casino but there's a lot of people with phds and there's you know they're doing studies and uh I end up talking to a guy who designed slot machines and he basically explains like oh yeah here's how a slot machine works and he lays out this system and I talk to other people who talk about it in different ways so I call it the scarcity Loop and so the reason a slot machine works is it works on this three-part system that I call the scarcity Loop so part one or the first condition is opportunity you have an opportunity to get something of value so in the case of a slot machine it's it's money right uh part two is unpredictable rewards you know you're going to get the thing of value at some point but you don't know when and you don't know how valuable it's going to be so with the slot machine once you play a game and those reels are rolling they could land and you get nothing they could land and you win say $2 on your dollar bet or you could win $20,000 on your dollar bet there's a crazy range of outcomes every single game and then three and this is important is quick repeatability so once those reels land you can immediately repeat the behavior you can play again so the average slot machine player plays 16 games a minute which is more than we blink now the reason that this is uh important to talk talk about that we're not just talking about slot machines here right this isn't a gambling podcast is that uh this system can get people to do a lot of other behaviors that are seemingly irrational too so it's uh it's what makes a lot of different systems like social media work right you post something you got an opportunity to get some likes some status so you check and recheck because you don't know when those likes are coming in you don't know if your post is going to go viral you might get cancelled you might get a message from someone that you think is great on and on and on right um it's in dating apps it's in different financial apps so one of the reasons that uh Robin

[00:49:35] Hood really took off is because they increased the quick repeatability by removing fees for trades uh it's in online shopping a lot of uh advertisers are using Casino like features in their ads to sort of Drive profits and that's uh led to a Sevenfold increase in conversion rates when they put like a spinning wheel for a discount and so I think when when you start to look at the behaviors that people have a hard time moderating I think a lot of them rely on this system let's talk a little bit more about um how one can use that information to break the cycle um let's talk about drug use right so you you chose a very interesting place to go to investigate drug use I was very surprised by that given the problems we have here in the

[00:50:27] US you could have literally gone to any city in the US I'm not sure why you had to go into Baghdad the reason that I went into Baghdad is because um you had nothing and now you have something and it really stands for what I think uh the conditions that you need for a addiction uh epidemic to rise so to give some context um for most of the time Iraq didn't have a drug problem and a lot of that was for political reasons Saddam ruled with kind of an iron fist around that and then the US invades and it destabilizes the country right so you have a big population that has lived through a war and then soon after Syria Falls Syria becomes a narco

[00:51:14] State effectively and they start producing a drug that is called captagon and it's analogous to methamphetamine and so they start sending this drug all throughout the Middle East so you've got three things you got one you have a population who is in a lot of pain uh you have few ways to deal with that pain that are more productive not a lot of options and then three you have a substance that solves that pain that problem in the short term immediately and so I think that um leads to that rise in addiction and you I think you see it here in the US as well it's like why did the opioid epidemic start in states where the factories had moved out well it's because factories move out our lives change we don't have a lot of resources things have gotten really dark and now we have this flood of pills that can take away those problems in the short term that can allow us to escape from that life we live but I think um the reason for going to Iraq instead of place in the US is simply that this is happening now on the ground and it is just booming and it and it is a new substance there are kind of two models for drug addiction um what what are those two models so there's the uh sort of moral failing model so we've thought about it two different ways uh that it's a moral failing I.E a drug user an addict is a bad person they're making this you know very specific choice to just mess over other people and putting themselves ahead of of everyone else or or even an extension of that is they simply don't have the self-management self-discipline so even if they're not deliberately doing this to sabotage their life they're they're so lacking in moral character that they can't manage themselves yeah and then the second is the brain disease model that um addiction is the result of a brain disease effectively drugs change your brain in such a way that um removes Your

[00:53:11] Capacity to make any decisions around the behavior and that drug uh addiction is a chronic and relapsing disease let's talk about a counter example to both of those um um what what do we know about Vietnam vets use of heroin when they were in Vietnam versus when they returned and and how what does that what does that tell us yeah so the Vietnam

[00:53:38] War you had about 20 to 25% of soldiers US soldiers who were in Vietnam were addicted to heroin they're regular frequent users of heroin and President Nixon he decides I don't want to let all these heroin addicts back into the United States it was a significant number of people so he decides to start a program that is called operation golden flow and the deal is this if you want to come back into to the United

[00:54:07] States as a soldier who's been in Vietnam you have to produce a clean urine test if you do not produce a clean urine test you will be left in Vietnam so if addiction basically uh obliterates the capacity to make any choices any decisions you would expect that 25% of soldiers in Vietnam would be left in Vietnam now what actually happened is that nearly every single one provided clean urine and when they got back into the United States the vast majority of them about 95% managed to stay clean the 5% that relapsed they tended to be people who had used drugs before the war so this suggests uh that people aren't necessarily a slave to chemical right that maybe it's a little bit more nuanced than it being purely a brain disease where choice is completely obliterated how can we extrapolate from that to where we are today in other words we're sitting in the midst of an unbelievable epidemic I've even done a podcast on this and it's a little outside of you know my area of expertise and you could argue and I have argued that it does impact longevity because uh mortality rates uh for the US population are actually in a small state of decline being driven almost exclusively by the death of people aged roughly 25 to 55 where we've seen the deaths of

[00:55:40] Despair uh increase at a rate we've never seen before so deaths of Despair are now um and and the biggest of the three deaths of Despair so we count accidental overdose or you know that that includes poisoning right so Fentanyl in a drug that you don't think has fentanyl um alcohol rated deaths and suicides so those three are collectively expanding but the greatest of the three by far is the overdose the non-suicide overdose so what do you what do you think explains that how much of each of the relative contributions do you think are contributing to that because it's no longer just in the old Steel Mill Town you know which I think probably explained the thin edge of the WB in the late 9s and early 2000s but here we are 25 years later and this is an epidemic in any and every city including my city of Austin yeah I think if you're looking at it um purely from a death statistics um that goes back to Fentanyl and that fentanyl is being put in um drugs that are all over the country now and people aren't necessarily aware that they're getting a drug right so I I think we also have to back up and go okay well why do people why do people use drugs why would people use a drug knowing that there's a risk that that there's fentanyl in something that they weren't expecting fentanyl to be in right I think when you look at drugs from a historical perspective um humans have always used psychotic substances as tools to accomplish something so if you think about uh chewing cocoa Leaf in

[00:57:16] South America right the cocoa Leaf was used to enhance focus on Long hunts to uh kill hunger on Long hunts when you couldn't find food same with tobacco um and so you tend to see that substances have always been used as a tool to accomplish something right because they benefited the person's life somehow now what has changed between today and you know 100 thousand years ago is that we have made uh we have taken our substances and we have distilled them into something where the psychoactive component is so strong and pure that it really can become almost an obliterate in a way right and um over time the availability has risen as well so I think when you think about something like fentanyl being placed into things is I think there's a lot of people that can use drugs and be okay would I recommend that no but can people use drugs um recreationally I think there are plenty of people who can and do um the work of Carl Hart for example gets into this a lot um and so what happens when you start getting fentanyl in drugs that people who are using it recreationally get um you start to see people who die so there's recently in

[00:58:38] New York City there was a uh bad batch of cocaine that had fentanyl in it and you had five people die in Manhattan in a single night and these are not people living on the street right these are like people who have an apartment White Collar people who use cocaine recreationally exactly and so I think that that really accounts for the rise in uh overdose deaths so in other words you you're you're not necessarily thinking that we're seeing an increase in the epidemic of I don't know how to describe it but like catastrophic drug use or drug use that is commenor it with no function in life outside of drug use

[00:59:15] I think we very well might be because uh the substance is when I'm talking about you know deaths being spread around the country I think that accounts for that but I do think that our substances today are strong enough that they can have more extreme consequences yeah in other words the deaths of Despair might be over counting because some of those people dying might not be in add the same yeah that said a push back to that would be look should anybody really be using cocaine like what does it say about us if we need to be using cocaine is there some is there a you know like let's go back to the example you gave um we clearly evolved to enjoy the rush of norrine right but the the cocoa Leaf never produced the concentrated high in many ways the drugs of today are the equivalent of a bag of Peanut M&M's right like they're simply so concentrated in Bliss that there's nothing that compared to it's not that you couldn't eat a peanut before or even have some cacao right but nobody imagined the crunchy shell with the sugar and the chocolate and the this and that and the other thing and that's that's sort of what the cocaine and the heroin are to their predecessor right that same logic though too also applies for alcohol which we culturally accept right so in the past alcohol um our our sort of proclivity as humans for alcohol is probably because alcohol used to help us find food so when you think about uh you know we're searching the land for for fruit uh fruit would fall from trees it would ripen on the ground it would begin to ferment and it would put off this sort of funky smell from the alcohol that would help us find the food when we actually got the fruit um that low level of alcohol in the fruit would help us eat more of it it's the Apper TF effect right so now though we have you know last night at my hotel and Austin they've got this like big super long bar and you can see all the bottles and how many of them have the same amount of alcohol that fermented fruit would have pretty much zero we're talking like

[01:01:21] Bourbons that are you know 120 proof or whatever um so I think that the more that you scale up and concentrate the psychoactive substances I think probably um the more problems you can get into and so then then there's like this debate it's like okay well if alcohol is okay should cocaine like should the government regulate cocaine and that way we don't have to worry about fentanyl being in I mean that's just like an entire can of worms that um probably best left for policy makers so what is the use of methadone um tell us about how to at least address one of the issues in the scarcity Loop if you're trying to help a person who's opioid addicted yeah so one of the things that I think makes drugs so compelling and attractive to people is um the element of the scarcity Loop of unpredictability so when you think about getting and using any street drug there's a lot of unpredictable elements in that are you going to be able to find the drug are you going to get in trouble as you try and find the drug uh once get the drug how strong is it going to be is it going to be really good is it going to be really bad and then you use it and you know a lot could happen from there and so with methodone you find that once you make the drug um predictable in the sense that like the environment becomes predictable the timing of when you get it becomes predictable the dose becomes predictable you start to see people be able to Wayne off of drugs and in fact people who use methodone often won't get high from the drug and I think you see this in a lot of pharmaceuticals as well like the the the addiction rate for uh prescribed drugs that are controlled where the dose and the timing is controlled the addiction rates for those are way lower simply because there's no there's no unpredictability there's no game behind it all right let's pivot a little bit and talk about material possessions you've alluded to it already because you mentioned how during the pandemic many of us increased our e-shopping and um I suppose like all good addictions there's an Adaptive component to that right like at the beginning of the pandemic when it was March and April of 2020 I think there's a pretty good reason not to go out we had no idea what we were dealing with and the fact that

[01:03:36] Amazon could deliver things to my door that I used to go out for made complete and total sense and yet why is it that I probably still buy as much on Amazon now as I did then if not more yeah I think I think there are evolutionary reasons for having more items right if uh you could get more tools as a person that probably gave you a survival Advantage having more items was probably a better idea than having less especially when you're trying to survive right so I think we still have this uh drive to accumulate stuff but the difference of course is that now we live in a world where we manufacture so much stuff and it's cheaper than ever before so even just a couple hundred years ago the average person for for example owned about three outfits now the average person owns 104 outfits and they also only wear 10% of the clothes that they own so we there's like I think the stats are 20% of the stuff in our closets we don't wear at all I think there's another uh I'm going to get the math here wrong 40% or something that we're like ah it's okay I don't really love it and then there's a few items where we I wear them sometimes and then we're left with 10% where we actually repeatedly wear those it items all the time and that that tracks with my own experience and so I think really um the difference today is that you know we've we've always had this itch to own things to possess things um but we can never scratch it that often because not only um things took time to make because of that they were more expensive it was harder to get the resources to make them and then once the Industrial Revolution happens we you know start cranking out stuff at an amazing rate now again this kind of goes back to the food thing where it's like well this is a good problem to have but I think you tend to see people collect and collect and collect items and now the average house according to one estimate has anywhere from 10,000 to 40,000 items in it so we clearly can see a direct and negative consequence to our well-being due to the scarcity Loops impact on food which is for 70% of us it results in overweight or obesity and for that subset of the population there's a nearly doubling of risk in other chronic diseases so that's like you might not feel the pain immediately but there is a real and clear threat to your longevity what are the downsides of stuff accumulation outside of the extremes so clearly there are people who have like hoarding diseases and then clearly there were people who could buy so much stuff that it would financially ruin them in the same way a gambler could be ruined but I suspect that most people listening to this are more like me where they have too much stuff but it doesn't seem to pose a direct risk to them yet I suspect that there's something uh harmful about it what what is that well I do think there's some interesting research that suggest um being around too much in clutter I do think it impacts your ability to focus seems to be related to um anxiety different things um now is it a direct threat like you know heart disease is no but um I I think what tends to happen is when you look at why people buy I think there's basically four reasons I think the first is um items are tools we use them to accomplish a greater goal this is probably how people would have used things for most of time uh two we can use them to get status so you're buying something uh in order to display something about yourself to others right it's kind of a status play it's like no one buys a Rolex because they want to know what time it is you're talking to a watch guy here well same here I'm I'm

[01:07:42] I'm aware of it I'm talking I'm talking crap on myself um and then number three is that we can use Goods to belong so think of um you know you wear your F1 shirt when you go to the F1 race it's like you're part of this community and it pulls you into the community and I think you see that practically um Beyond Sports I mean certain types of people wear Patagonia certain types of people wear the Black

[01:08:08] Rifle Coffee Company shirt right we kind of get these tribes that we can uh identify with via a thing to buy and then the fourth reason I think uh and I think this was a powerful one during the pandemic is simply that people are bored and we today have have much faster easier opportunity to purchase stuff than we ever have before I mean even even 20 years ago if a person wanted to buy something if they're bored um go out and do it you had to go out and do it you had to get in your car you had to go to the store you had to walk the aisles is this the thing I want is this thing like it's a timec consuming process um now we can just do it online we can search Amazon not to mention I think that when you look at how algorithms have invol have evolved I mean anyone who's ever spent 10 seconds on Instagram they know that that machine knows what they want to purchase more than they dosel that's what amazes me um usually when Instagram suggest something to me it's it's good it's good whereas interestingly Google isn't nearly as good for some reason I don't know why

[01:09:19] Google seems to really suggest dumb things to me I have no interest in but not Instagram yeah Instagram is very good very good I think it's probably it probably TAPS in better to it's probably that you interact with it in a different way even though I don't I barely spend time on social media yeah but it it must know when I watch an exercise video or maybe it knows I'm posting exercise video it's always suggesting the coolest exercise equipment and I'm always like even though I don't have any room for that I could really use that device you and I are the same I get I get exercise

[01:09:52] Contraptions and I'm sorry to bring up the Grateful Dead Again on your podcast but once I start following all these random Grateful Dead accounts what am I getting getting like oh you need this shirt from the 1994 tour it's awesome oh dang it over the pandemic I bought the thing I get I get a lot of t-shirt ads for things that I'm clearly doing yeah and so I think that you if you are bored you can you know you might first get bored and you feel that discomfort and so boredom I talked about this on the last podcast talk about in the comfort crisis but boredom is this evolutionary discomfort that basically just tells us whatever you're doing with your time right now the return on your time is worn thin so go do something else now in the past um that something else was often productive if you think about hund gatherers they're going to if they're not if no animals are coming through when they're hunting what they're going to do is go okay well maybe we could fish maybe we could pick potatoes maybe we could pick berries today when we feel that discomfort we have a lot of very easy effortless hyper stimulating escapes from it in the form of of cell phones in the form of TVs and so now when you feel it it's like okay pull out your cell phone I guess I'll open

[01:10:59] Instagram I'm scrolling I'm still bored oh there's that t-shirt I love or that exercise Contraption and then it's like yeah I guess I'll buy it and so I think you start to see purchases really um up when we can repeat the behavior faster so as a general rule the faster a human can rep any animal can repeat the behavior the more likely they are to repeat the behavior and this is something that came up in um slot machines in the 80s as we kind of alluded to yeah I've thought a lot about what you just said with respect to boredom from our first discussion and

[01:11:30] I've tried to be more cognizant of it and uh in particular like how uncomfortable I am when I'm bored and there aren't that many times I get to be bored but but you know this idea that just going places without your phone which I think is a good practice right like I'm going to go somewhere today and I'm not going to take my phone because I can actually live without it you know I I can I I used to do this there was a day when I I did this before yeah and then you find yourself in the line at the store without a phone and it's odd at first it's really weird it's like it's five minutes where there's nothing to do yeah but I I also think that you can train yourself to realize that it's an opportunity oh yeah no it's it's it's a it's a it's a beautiful opportunity to just observe your thoughts to observe some element of the surroundings it's actually why and we've talked you and I talked about it's why I love rocking right it's a no Phone Zone that is um is great but you know I think there's something different about rucking in that it's so physically challenging or you can make it so physically challenging that the lack of music or stimulation is okay but there's something about Stillness and otherwise boredom that that I think can be challenging and to think that if we didn't have that drive our species might not have survived right that's that's a very cool thought to me oh yeah absolutely and I do think too you know you asked me did you sort of adapt to the chimane food I do think you can adapt to boredom so for example you know in the comfort crisis I spend all this time in the Arctic and I will say that the boredom was most intense early on in the trip after you've sort of removed yourself from the incoming emails the screens the million things that you're normally doing um things start to slow down and you start to calm down and you start to become more observant and I mean I will tell you probably the most uh mentally well

[01:13:31] I've ever been in my life was after a couple weeks up in the Arctic because you just um you're just dialed in you just feel so much calmer and I do think that we um live in a world now of hypers speed um anytime we want to be stimulated we can do that and by the way it's it's going to be Tick Tock right it's like coming at you fast um so I do think that there's a case for finding time in your life for removal from all that to sort of lean back into boredom and one of the one of the things I guess issues I've had with a lot of the messaging around how people need to use their cell phone less is that like yes that is important um but what tends to happen is when people take an hour off their phone screen time they go okay well I'm bored what do I do now and they turn on Netflix and there's no difference right um so I advocate for trying to think how can I Infuse boredom back into my life and really for me that's you know go out take a walk for 20 minutes see what happens to your thoughts be willing to sort of sit with that and see where it leads you beyond the screen because on the screen is what everyone else is getting and so I think this is particularly great for ideation you know I think this is one of the reasons why people have their best ideas in the shower cuz you're not focused on anything you're just kind of letting your mind wander do its thing and then bam that's the angle whatever it is that's the idea finishing out this discussion on stuff um my kids have many more toys than I had and my wife and I talk about this a lot because I kind of live vicariously through them when it comes to Lego so I just can't stop buying Lego because I love building it with them watching them build it creating a huge

[01:15:18] Lego City but I wonder like is there a downside of this because my kids are good kids like I don't feel like they're spoiled brats or anything like that but like I only had one Lego and I had to take it apart and put it together and take it apart and put it together take it apart together and the truth of it is

[01:15:36] I see them getting bored of Lego like they're so conditioned that anytime a new one comes out dad goes and gets it because he can't wait to see it kind of thing and I do Wonder like am I doing them a disservice in the long run am I depriving them of a scarcity that that I had there there's an interesting study I came across when writing this book and it basically um it had groups of people and uh it had them solve a problem and one group uh was told they had abundant resources to solve it they could do all these different things to solve a problem the other group had scarce resources and so they had to come up with um different uses for tools and what ended up happening is that the group that was faced with more scarce resources they not only solved the problem um but they got more rewards from solving the problem by meyering it right so when I think about it as applied to Legos I don't uh so in the book I lay out um you know well how should we think about like what's a good way to think about making a purchase and one of the things that I argue for is framing purchases through the lens of gear not stuff so gear is an item that is allowing me to accomplish something that is life-giving right it's adding to this experience um that adds meaning into my life whereas stuff is often just kind of a purchase to fulfill an Impulse um I'm buying something cuz I think it's going to make me this other person right it's going if I buy this shirt I'm going to look like this it's going to be awesome my life is gonna whatever you get the point and so I think when I think about your experience with

[01:17:08] Legos that does seem to be adding a real enhancement to your life like you're getting this time with your kids where you're building Legos um at the same time it might be interesting now that you got this pile of Legos from all these killer kits what could we make with this guys right we're not following the the the plan here anymore we're going could we build a castle what would a castle look like with the resources we have and I think that that would probably lead them to exercise well it's funny you say that we've already learned that so when you buy the kit they love to build the thing but then they like to keep it and play with it as is but where they get far more enjoyment is the loose

[01:17:47] Lego pile so you go to Lego store you can buy loose Lego and then there's a store called bricks and mini fig where they just it's just a free-for-all and the the mo they spend 80% of their time building a city that is huge I'll show you after the podcast you will find it hilarious it's taken up our basement and it's just made from the loose Lego and it's their own stuff so like every month we go get more pieces they add another floor to the condo you know they've built like the grocery store where I print out like HB is the grocery store in Texas so like I've I've made and laminated HB signs that then stick on their grocery stores and all this other stuff so I think you're right

[01:18:32] I think they're they must be getting more enjoyment out of that because it's where they're putting more time yeah um as part of the book I talk about the value of exploration so um you know this feeds into information and that I think humans have a desire for information right if you in the past if you were the person who had more information if you could crave information and try and get it try to cure these uncertainties that would give you a survival Advantage now we're still wired to Crave information and I think that anyone has experienced this practically you know anytime you get a itch in your side and you're going oh my gosh am I dying now you know you're going down web andd like we know we want information Twitter wouldn't work if people weren't information hoarders but I think the difference between how we acquired information in the past and how we acquire it acquire it today is that the past you had to go there in the present moment to learn something it was a Mind Body effort to get a piece of information right is there greener grass over there well you have to go to the other side to see if there is greener grass and it's very up in the air um there's a lot of uncertainties but by going through that mind body process Outdoors um that real role of the dice you get more value from that when you realize oh we found this greener grass this is great and I think today because we can Google so much we still have this information itch but we scratch it um online so now I think that people's experiences of their day-to-day life oftentimes get mediated by uh information from other people so what do

[01:20:09] I mean by that okay when is the last time that you went to a restaurant just cold right you just picked a random restaurant you didn't read the Yelps from five different people you didn't read all the reviews you didn't look at the menu you didn't kind of go oh that looks like a good table hopefully can get that one now by doing that when you get to that restaurant your experience in there has totally changed totally changed right because you now have expectations you have expectations from you know Jim Smith 99 on Yelp because he told you to get the trout but hold the

[01:20:39] Almond sauce or whatever it is um and I think that that changes us and I think that there is a case now for trying to re-explore the world like we used to right it's can you go into situations totally cold and what will that be like what sort of value will you get from that internally by doing this thing that no one told you about you don't have any expectations going in and you are just having this totally uh unadulterated moment that is in the present moment and it's of course not just restaurants it's like watching a movie right reading a book uh listening to an album going to a different part of town right there's all these different ways that you can have these sort of uh more momentous occasions in your life um without necessarily needing to follow the metaphorical Lego plan to the point of your kids is why I'm talking about this on that topic of information and exploration um you write about how Homo sapiens were really the breakoff point to True exploration uh in terms of distance traveled uh risk taken

[01:21:45] Etc I was thinking about it after I read that and I I don't know if you have a point of view or a thought as to why for example neand thals didn't do the same they were bigger than us stronger than us had bigger brains than us and could walk upright in other words they had all the tools that would have provided for the same if not greater exploration capacity as Homo sapiens do we have a sense of what changed yeah we I mean we are fascinating in that in basically 50,000 years we took over the world right uh neanderthals were around a long time and they just kind of were in the same place most of the time not to mention that but once we take over the world we go all right well let's put some highways on this thing maybe we should build a

[01:22:28] Launchpad for a spaceship and go up into outer space and oh what's what's in that water right let's build a submarine um so we are fascinating that way was that just something that randomly got selected for in the in the change to Homo Sapien and then it just got rewarded and rewarded and rewarded like is there no other structural reason for it other than just Garwin as part of the book I looked at um there's a little bit evidence of this Gene that nicknamed the exploration uh Gene and um it seems to be around in populations that move a lot more so it's uh far more prevalent in

[01:23:03] Nomads it's far more prevalent uh in societies that would have traveled farther um from our origins in East Africa and so that there's probably some reason there but I think ultimately um you know we're a species that and most animals are like this you do the the good thing right so there's some inherent reason why we would have kept moving and maybe it's just that we get internal rewards from that so what do we owe a gratitude or dispair to Benjamin day for oh man okay so before 1830 newspapers cost six cents uh they tend to cover business and politics and uh they're weekly so Benjamin day comes in and he goes all right I want to I want to to create a paper that gets like a lot of readers because 6 cents is a lot of money back then so he goes all right what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a newspaper and I'm going to sell it for one cent now I'm selling it at a loss so I have to make up uh my loss somehow so what do I do what if I went to some companies and said hey I will publish stuff about your brand in my newspaper and people will see it and they'll buy your stuff that is to say this guy really started advertising the adver in model so once he does that though you can charge more money for your advertisements the more readers you have okay so how do we do that because we're at a loss right now the more readers we have the more money we can make off of each ad that's how we're making our money well business and politics is kind of boring right business is a little bit boring so what this guy does is uh by dropping the price to one cent he's selling it a loss but more people will will be able to buy it so he can get a bigger audience and then second what he does is he starts covering sort of murder

[01:25:00] Mayhem Affairs fights all these different things that attract attention so this is when you start to see the real shift from us from newspapers covering this sort of nice boring things to this guy going um literally he ran a headline that was bathed in Blood and it was about this you know murder suicide in New York city so he starts to publish uh every sing day for one penny and the headlines are always crazy Gore and I think this is when you start to see the attention economy in which we now live really start to take off and it's the same deal you know in order to make a in order to make money off an ad model you have to get as many eyes as possible and they have to be certain eyes and the way you do that is often by running information that is uh negative that is lurid that is going to capture information that's going to capture as much attention as possible and you know for example still today 90% of news tends to be negative now this holds whether or not the world is improving or not right so we could things could be much better than they were 100 years ago but we're still having our papers are still 90% negative news yeah and and again there's an evolutionary basis for negativity bias right you could make the case for how we were far we are far better off evolutionarily to pay attention to negative signals rather than positive signals negative thing is what could kill you that demands your attention the positive thing is great but it doesn't need as much attention in the moment right exactly if you're the person who's uh looking at how beautiful the flowers are as the saber 2 tiger walks up this way you're not going to you're not going to live that long God it is it is so incredible to think that natural selection being such an amazing tool could have no appreciation for what would come with modernity and how it would render so many things maladaptive yeah and I think this is you know the best example of this is with a lot of social media companies and how algorithms work you know if you let those things run their course things that get the most traction tend to be the most uh lurd crazy things you know and I think that that is one of the main reasons um we're so polarized as a country today is that moral outrage is particularly uh great at capturing attention and those things get up voted because they're going to get more eyes and while that is uh good for bringing in eyes and making money for a social media company it's not necessarily good for society always so you wrote in the information chapter about a study that was done on the social media use of politicians yeah what did you learn so this kind of goes back this this uh goes back to quantification and um how there are some downsides to quantifying everything and gamifying everything but the long story short of that study is basically that when politicians first get onto Twitter and they uh the scientists analyze use AI algorithm to analyze all the tweets of about 10 years uh of politician tweets and what they found is that when politicians would first get onto Twitter it was like they would use hey we're having a fundraiser blah blah blah you know um nice things relatively benign but once they would tweet something negative that was attacking another person they would start to get more likes and retweets and that in turn would feel good right so they would tell them oh this works on this platform this is what you need to do on this platform to get these points because this is how we are scoring our behavior on this platform and then from there you started to see the number of negative tweets from them increase over time because that's what gets rewarded on social media and so uh you know this probably is an accurate reflection of maybe who these people really are or what we really want in society do we want our politicians being terrible human beings on Twitter I don't think so it's interesting imagine um a thought experiment where Twitter and social media ran exactly the same as now except the person who was commenting was blinded to the uh feedback from others so likes and retweets for example so if you put out something you could put it out and everybody could still see it just as they do but if they liked it or retweeted it you wouldn't see that how do you think that would change things well it wouldn't train I mean so is there to back up is it's human training right the algorithm trains us how to use it how to behave and use the social media uh platform so I don't see a huge difference between when I go stand by the treat jar and I say Stockton sit and my dog puts his butt on the floor and I give him a treat he knows to do that right well when I go on social media and

[01:30:01] I tweet um some crazy thing say I don't actually do that but I tweet some crazy thing and all you other humans go like like like that tells me oh if I want the good thing whether it's my dog with a treat with a likes on social media I got to do that thing whether it's sitting or writing Donald Trump is an idiot Hillary

[01:30:22] Clinton's an idiot so and so's an idiot right um I don't see much difference between that really you get trained on these based on um how the system is set up with likes and retweets and followers so that's a long way of saying I think you'd probably see less of that training occur yeah so we want how do we reconcile this right we have evolved to want information have we evolved to want the truth that's a good question um I think that so there's this guy I talked to whose name is um T win and he is a philosopher at the University of Utah and he talked a lot about how you know we sort of evolved to trust um when we feel like we'd gotten the right information it gives us this sort of aha moment so we have a question we find what we believe is the answer and we go aha that feels good this makes sense um things were probably pretty clear in the past right you either got the F that was going to lead you to survive or you didn't you either found shelter or you didn't so you could trust that aha here's the food but I think in today's age whenever we have a question we can go seeking out information from a lot of different sources and we can get that aha moment whether or not the information is factually correct or not so here's a here's a good example is that you know why do uh why are conspiracy theories compelling because they give you an aha moment conspiracy theories they might seem complicated and they often are right you got the big board and you got all the strings and it's like this person this person right but at the end of the day you have a very specific answer for why this thing is the way it is right it clears up any ambiguity when in reality most things in life are very uncertain they're very ambiguous we don't fully understand why a certain thing has ever happened but if you can sort of provide someone with an aha that is going to give them a feeling of clarity a feeling of certainty and they can rely on that to make decisions whether or not the information is act actually accurate yeah I think people also find conspiracy theories um appealing when they provide a grand narrative to something to which the truth is insignificant uh to me the the best example of this because it happens to be one of the conspiracy theories

[01:32:50] I've gone down the RAB B ho on is the assassination of JFK and um I can say this I'm sure I will enrage a subset of the listeners like every available shred of reasonably good evidence if you actually understand ballistics and unfortunately my training in surgical uh residency taught me a lot about what bullets do when they hit people everything points to a single shooter everything points to three shots being fired by Lee Harvey Oswald by the way it wasn't hard shooting that's the other thing that's like there's no way he could have got no no no like these were the easiest three shots in the world he killed JFK um why do we have to have so many conspiracies because how can we accept that such an insignificant irrelevant human being like Lee Harvey Oswald could alter the course of history that's impossible for most of us to wrap our minds around it's much easier to think that the CIA had to do this because of pick your favorite

[01:33:53] Oliver Stone idiotic reason um and so I yeah I think that also like I wonder how that factors into us as storytellers and and the need to you know have sort of information again I don't know if there's an evolutionary basis for that but but I think that that also plays a role in in people always and again I I think some conspiracy theories turn out to be true right so it's not always that the that the that the first answer is is right or the first answer is wrong this kind of gets to another issue right which is and I think NN brings this up which is the idea that we should think of food and information as analogous where too much fast food is bad for you too much loose information without

[01:34:45] Nuance is bad for you yeah so he yeah he compared compared it to food where if you give up on a food's nutritional quality it's very easy to make very delicious tasting food seductively good food um and the same is with information if something just feels really good really tasty you should probably use that as a sign to maybe investigate the issue further to look to look at the what the other side is saying right if you're willing to sacrifice truth and

[01:35:14] Nuance you can have the most seductive information possible yeah if you're willing to sacrifice nutrition nutritional quality you can have the most delicious food possible I think it's a beautiful analogy yeah exactly and it is so easy to find anything online today and there's there's you know in the book I talk about how there's uh answers to the most sort of mundane questions that we could have in daily life like product reviews you know what is the best pillowcase it's like this is you know this is the epitome of a first world problem but here I'm going to spend 800 words of my time reading this story about what is the best pillowcase you know and they're just all over the board we have so many experts we have so much information um that I think we have more you know maybe knowledge in the world but we don't necessarily have more understanding and more of an understanding of like how should I actually spend my time do I want to go down the you know the hourlong review uh review sites on pillowcases or whatever the item might be and you can apply this to so many different things I mean you know your background I mean does does web ND ever really help a person like figure out what's going on or does it just lead them to go oh definitely stage four cancer yeah yeah I I think that's a very fair uh comparison what what is the I don't want to say solution but what what would be a tool you could recommend to somebody who's listening to us talk about this and acknowledging it and saying you know what come to think of it I'm a bit of an information addict and I'm I'm at a point where my innate desire for information is becoming maladaptive because it's being applied in a manner that you know just as my natural and adaptive Behavior to seek food has become maladaptive I'm in the same place information wise H how would you suggest a person cope with that yeah

[01:37:09] I do think that information falls into that scarcity Loop that I talked about right you've you're looking for this piece of information that you think is going to improve your life but you don't know where it is and so you search and search the web and then when you find it it's like Bingo great I found it and then you can sort of quickly repeat so I think one way that you can slow down um any Behavior you do in excess or reduce the frequency is to sort of slow it down so there's this interesting study that I talk about in the book where they had a group of um students they had two groups they had them both figure out the answer to a question now the first group could use the internet right so they go online they search it they find it really fast great the second group could not use the internet so they had to use books so they got to go to to the library they got to walk the stacks they got to find the book and then they got to open the figure out where the information is in the book like go okay I got it they return back um not only did they have slightly better information but more importantly they were better able to recall it later on um when they were tested on it they did uh better so I think that there is an argument for a shift to slow information when you really want to understand something right because these people were better able to put it into context now most people are going to listen to that and say it makes sense but I'm never going to get up off my desk and go to the public library and look at the stacks so is there a way that you can toggle between fast and slow information still using the internet for example yeah I think um so I think kind of the metaphor there is like if you do really want to understand something realize you're probably going to have to put in a little bit more work it can't be a quick

[01:38:44] Google Search now at the same time that that's how I justify the existence of this podcast by the way is if you really want to understand a topic that's why I I try not to make too many apologies for the fact that we have 3our episodes yeah I think that a useful heris is to if you've got just a random everyday question it's not of much consequence in your life um try to make the decision in 60 seconds right you search for the information you want to know okay found it in 60 seconds yeah that's probably right you know how do I get to Arby's bam there you go um what pillowcase should I buy pick in 60 seconds right pick something just pick something cuz eventually you're wasting time uh I had a I have a story in the book about how when I was an intern at

[01:39:26] Esquire way back in the day um I had I got this assignment and it was okay find out how much money the pope makes and I go okay that's my job I'm G to find out how much money the pope makes so I end up searching around online um I haven't called up some Catholic academic and you know he was kind of like I think it's this much whatever so I send in the research file to my editor and I get an email back just says meet me in the conference room in 5 minutes so I get up I go into the conference room and this was at the

[01:40:00] Hearst building in New York which is where Esquire is and so you know we're looking down the barrel of 8th Avenue and he's sitting at this long table and very Esquire guy you know he has the button down the tie is loose um he goes sit down I say okay I go sit by him and he he just looks at me starts shaking his head leans back and he goes no no no no no if you want to know how much money the pope makes you call the

[01:40:27] Vatican call the Vatican so the point is I had totally missed the most obvious answer to that right if you want to know something about a person ask the person but instead we have now all these sort of kooky ways to go around it so I think it's uh I think the metaphor is like if you can really just go to the source in a way uh do that right read the study if you hear someone online saying that you know I don't know oatmeal is totally toxic and blah blah blah and like oh by the way you're probably going to have to learn to read a study luckily you provide information like that that is useful uh if you want to know what a person thinks maybe ask them look about look at what they've written on a thing watch the full interview in context right you see someone say something that seems crazy in a 30-second Instagram clip it's like okay well maybe we should get the first like five minutes and the last five minutes after that so we kind of know what the context is and you'll probably find that it's taken out of context and like it's being used against the person right so I think it is so easy to get such quick seductive information you want to do a little more work for the things that you really want to understand and not jump to conclusions like we've seen so many I mean for example media Outlets get in trouble because they publish all these op-eds about you know a 30second

[01:41:47] Instagram clip like with the Covington Catholic and now they owe the kid $250 million cuz we jump to conclusions on a 30-second video clip so the last section of the book is on happiness um which I actually found probably the the chapter that I was thinking the most about right it was the one where I would pause the most and reflect and think and and stuff like that so I'll start with arguably the most difficult question which is how do you define happiness well I can tell you that I had the same question and I still do have the same question I'll tell you what the the dictionary says I think it says um

[01:42:29] Joy a feeling of joy and there's one other word maybe like Felicity or something like that so you go oh okay well what does joy mean you go to Joy it goes a feeling of Happiness so it's circular right uh and I think that you see people define happiness in all different ways so I think it was uh senica who said it's uh not having anxiety about the future feeling okay in the moment not having anxiety about the future uh you know John Lennon the famous uh song Happiness is a Warm Gun right um I think it's hard to Define and it's also one of those things where um maybe we don't even know it when we are happy but we can look back and be like oh that was a happy moment in my life like it's this very very murky thing and yet we all want to be happy right that is sort of the uh the capital G goal of most of the things we do we take a drink because we think it's going to make us happy we make buy this purchase because we think it's going to make us happy um we seek out that information on WebMD because we think that if we know what this thing is that'll give us some relief right um but it is a very confusing topic and I think maybe we know a little bit less about it than we think where does happiness fit on M Love's hierarchy of need is I mean is it I know self-actualization is about the fourth rung but where does happiness actually fit into it I don't think it does I mean it's got the I don't think so does it I I don't think so I don't but but I haven't looked at it in a very long time yeah I dove into that um a bit in the book but I can't recall I don't think it was at the I don't think it was on there so that seems a little odd isn't it because depending on how you define happiness it does seem like a very high order goal yeah it is a high order goal but of course I guess he's not defining it as a need and maybe that's why it doesn't belong there so for this chapter I what made me write this chapter is sort of realizing that um you know we all want more happiness sort of the book looks at what are these things that we all want more of um how they changed over time and I think that um While most of the chapters say you know we had a scarcity of this thing now we have a massive abundance of it I don't know if that's necessarily held for happiness in a lot of ways right so one great example is that uh from 1979 to 1999 you saw uh real income in uh grow by about 43% among

[01:45:15] Americans you we didn't actually become any happier right so if we think that you know ress and money is always going to make us happier I don't think that that is the case when do you think Peak happiness occurred because like I often think that on my worst day I'm so happy to be alive today and to have not have been alive 200 years ago or 2,000 years ago or 20,000 years ago now you know that's a bit of a dumb thing to say I know because I have no idea what it was like to be alive 20,000 years ago when you don't know what today feels like so in other words you know getting eaten alive by mosquitoes and ants every day while you scavenge for food if you don't know what this is is just what it is so

[01:45:58] I get that one can't make that statement but do the people who attempt to study this have a sense of when Peak happiness occurred for our species uh not that I've come across I mean I do know that we are seeing decreases in happiness in the data a lot of the data suggests that people are becoming less happy um I L I would imagine that probably as we've gotten more technology in a way it's like technology improves your life and happiness to a certain point and then at a certain point it begins to constrain you and that could potentially make you more unhappy so Arthur Brooks has has written a lot about happiness and I I have found the way Arthur writes about it to be the the best way for me to think about it because a he doesn't write about happiness as a feeling and that's I think the problem with the dition Ary definition and why it's circular because happiness points to a feeling of joy and joy points to a feeling of happiness but instead he really writes about components or what he describes the macronutrients of

[01:47:03] Happiness um and so uh enjoyment being one of them and enjoyment being a much deeper thing than pleasure right pleasure being purely sensory enjoyment being more cerebral and really having this essential component of being shared with others um and then he talks about satisfaction which of course is the most fleeting of them but is highest when there is a struggle right so this goes back to many of the examples you've already given which is if you get something easily it's not very satisfying if you have to work very hard to achieve something it's more satisfying but probably for very important evolutionary reasons we can't keep satisfaction and that's what Keeps

[01:47:50] Us striving um and then the final what again he calls macronutrient is sense of purpose um and again without that we can't have true happiness and I I honestly think of that as to date the best model I have encountered now you to study this continued your incredible journey of going and doing really hard things so what did you seek out in the pursuit of happiness so I go to long story short as I spent a week at a benedic monastery in the mountains of New Mexico and so then you have to ask well okay why why the hell would you go there and the answer is because you know

[01:48:34] I we do kind of live in a world where there's a lot of these uh different things we're supposed to be doing for our happiness and they're often backed by research right it's uh you got to meditate you got to gratitude Journal you got to have as many friends as possible blah blah blah and um you know that all seems great but when you look at these benedic monks what I find so fascinating about them is that they go against a lot of the happiness sort of research that's in pop culture right now um they live a pretty hard life they get up at 3:00 a.m. start to pray they don't eat a lot of food so they're not getting you know pleasure from uh meals they're also in silence most of the time they do hard labor 4 hours every single day they're not entirely social right because it's the silence and they often work alone but when researchers have done and no no they're celibate there's no relationships no relationship yeah no romantic relationships um no real access to the outside world in terms of you know they're not on Facebook and keeping up with the news that way it's a lot of um their motto is Aura at labora which is pray and work right and so what's interesting though is that there's a researcher whose name is Alex

[01:49:53] Bishop who's done a lot of uh research on them and their happiness levels and they seem to be happier than the average American despite all these hardships that they face in their life despite all these sort of crazy and necessary things they seem to be doing they wind up significantly happier than us when we have access to all these things that should make us you know feel great in the moment so I go and I live with them for a week and I think my main takeaway for them really goes back to uh what Arthur was saying is that if something is uh challenging to get I think we get more rewards from that and that also makes sense from an evolutionary perspective I talked to a guy whose's name is Thomas zall and he explained that there's probably the reason for this is probably you know if you had to search and search and search for food and like you weren't finding it um but you persisted and persisted and persisted and then you find the food that has to be inherently more rewarding than the food that was very easy to come by in order to incentivize future searches when you get in that situation um so it's that doing hard uh work and not necessarily having everything given to you I think becomes rewarding for humans um the other thing that I think is important about them is they're not necessarily in it for themselves right they've given their lives over to this higher ideal even though it does require a lot of sacrifice so for them that higher idea is God right they're trying to get out of themselves um they're trying to help others and help this greater idea um and it doesn't ultimately all come back to them and I think that um there's a lesson in there for the average person that is you know what sort of thing can you do to get out of yourself and find some greater meaning and purpose Beyond just your next desire yeah it's funny like I and I know that that chapter isn't written to suggest that that's the answer that hey if you're reading this but you don't feel really happy there's a there's a there's a monastery for you and you're going to go and wake up at 3:30 every morning do your first prayers go and work go and do your second prayers go and eat go and do your next prayers go and work I mean it it was the most unpleasant reading it made me uncomfortable I was like I would kill myself the work part I would get the prayer part would kill me I was like I I

[01:52:21] I just think I would lose my mind so um clearly that's not what you're proposing but it's an interesting contrast and example but yet I still wonder what it is that which element is missing for most of us right because I've met some people who you know have a have an amazing sense of purpose they're very

[01:52:46] Mission driven to to their work to their techn ology to their company whatever it is they're doing um they struggle and strive and succeed and that's short lived and then they do it again and again and again um and they also seem to enjoy themselves right they they they do do lavish things and they and they and they share the company of others and yet ostensibly they don't seem that happy um so these guys conversely Like You could argue their sense of purpose is I don't know they're not really serving the world like if every one of these monasteries went away the world would continue to turn on its axis you can't say that for many professions right like if every janitor went away tomorrow the world would grind to a halt right like think about it right if we had one week of every sanitation person stop working we couldn't function in society so so like even if your job is cleaning you have a really significant purpose um again not to disparage the monks but it's like they're in their own bubble where they're self-sufficient right they do everything for themselves but is that the purpose is it that they help each other I'm still struggling to understand how they're happy yeah I think they help each other I know they do a lot of work in the community as well so they help the community um I also wonder I mean I even wonder things like about the pace of their life you know it's um it's definitely slower than we live now um it's it's to me what it really suggests is that there is no perfect plan for happiness and in fact by trying to be happy that's not a great way to be happy right if you're trying to figure out what is the next thing I can do to get to be happy and so you Google how to be happy and it says oh well this study said this you need to start a gratitude

[01:54:44] Journal it's like okay that might help a few people but the reality is is that it's so so much more complicated than something that can just be sort of distilled down into like here are these quick actionables um but I do think the commonality you see is that um people who tend to be happy they tend to be do something that they believe is of service and is going to a greater good so even though if they all disappeared yeah the world would turn go on but maybe they believe they have what they're doing has consequence in some afterlife and to your point yeah good good point obviously if they're obvious yeah and so I think that um you know the takeaway is that you do need to it's probably useful for happiness to find something that is greater than yourself if you're doing the next sort of fulfilling your next impulse that's probably not not going to be good for you over the long run um austerity sometimes is a key to uh being happy because you knew you know these times where what it was like right it's like with the with the Gratitude journals it's like okay that's great but the best way to feel grateful for something is to be deprived of it for a while and these monks really practice that for example with food so they you know they do not eat a lot and then every now and then on like a Saint's birthday they get these festivals where it's okay we got a lot of food this is going to be great we're eating things we don't and like this becomes this moment where they're like oh I really appreciate this food that I worked hard to to bring to us you know and I think that um without having to put in effort or never being deprived of anything you just normalize to whatever you have it doesn't matter if you have the base model 2001 Honda Civic or the brand new

[01:56:31] Ferrari right if that's that's your thing that's what you're going to normalize to yeah absolutely um how much do you think that the following cycle is on an inevitable Loop in society and and this could be across multiple time scales so so hard times make hard m men Hard Men make soft times soft times make soft men soft men make hard times is that the is that the cycle of our species I think it I mean I I definitely think it's it's reasonable I think you see it uh historically I do what I think is so interesting about now is that um I think things change faster than ever uh people are changing how we spend our time is changing faster than ever and um I do wonder how that's affecting us I mean so I'm a professor at UNLV and I've seen changes in my students over the past seven years right you would normally think that a change in Behavior a big change in Behavior noticeably would probably take generations to pop up but I've definitely seen changes and I think it is um simply because of how we spend our time and attention more online you are the product of your attention right fewer in person in our inter actions um all those sorts of things what do you make of the difference between Solitude and loneliness as you gathered it from this experience yeah well you know I think that um probably for good reason there's a lot of information out about how you know it's good to have um friends to be social um I also think that there's a lot of people or maybe we don't need as many as we've been told I think that um you need what is called anticipatory support which is basically someone or some bigger idea that you can count on but in terms of having this big Bevy of friends I don't think that that is necessary for happiness I think that having certain people that you can count on basically um and having maybe one good relationship is better than a bunch of mediocre ones so when it comes to being alone and being in solitude I think the difference between um loneliness or aloneness is that you didn't necessarily choose that right you want to be with people but you're not able to whatever reason um whereas

[01:58:57] Solitude is using this time like you're you're consciously taking this time to be alone with yourself and use it um maybe to get to know yourself better so when you look at um some of the happiest people who we consider the happiest and most enlightened in history a lot of them spend a lot of time alone right

[01:59:16] Jesus walked out into the desert for 40 days the Buddha walked the Earth for six years or whatever it was um and when you look at a lot of those writings I don't think that they say oh this whole you know 40 days or six years was entirely blissed out you know it's hard to be alone but I think but by going through that and being like okay well why is it hard you can get to know yourself and get to sort of deeper Revelations about yourself and I think that's a narrative that you see across different faiths and history that sometimes people need to go through um Solitude as a way to gain insight into themselves and once they do that you can then come back into society and you're better able to function in it because you're now more self-reliant and really I think what um makes a good human is someone who can be reliant on themsel and can in turn help others you're right in the the chapter and it might even be in the epilogue that um for most of us our will to live is no longer really a vital part of our existence in fact this was in the epilogue if I recall because I believe you wrote about it in the context of learning survival skills prior to going into Baghdad and so I I was I was really struck by that because it it really resonates right like I don't know I can certainly think of times when I've exerted my will but I don't really think about it in terms of will to live and and yet for all of human history that was a thing like again you think about that snake jumping out of the Jungle or you think about you know the complete lack of food or the disent you just got that like there's so many areas where the will to live must have been one of the strongest selective features of our existence and yet today it's never put to the test what is the implication of that well I think it's easy to just sort of exist not and not live so I'll tell you my experience of this is uh before I go to

[02:01:31] Baghdad I realized okay I should probably learn some skills should things go south which you know there's a much higher likelihood of something going south in Baghdad than there is if I were to to your report on you know drugs in Ohio or something so I go meet uh my friend whose name is Mike Moreno um he's a VC guy but before that he spent a bunch of years in the CIA in

[02:01:57] Baghdad running operations so he takes me out into the desert in uh outside of San Diego and we go through all these different skills I'm going to need to know uh in order to survive should something go wrong while I'm there and at the end of the day so we spent eight hours like here's all these ways you could die

[02:02:17] Michael the end of the day we're sitting on the tailgate of his SUV and he looks over at me he goes man I'm really jealous that you're going there and we says that to me I look at him I'm like we just talked about like how this is not a good idea in many ways and yet you're wanting to go back what's up with that and he says you know I really what

[02:02:38] I miss most about my time there is because it was uh austere it was dangerous you did have to be present and focused on what was around you I found that extremely lifegiving right you were thrust into the moment and you really had to exercise this sort of will to live and I said okay and once I got back from

[02:03:00] Baghdad I totally understood that like I will remember every moment of being there because it is you can't just zone out right I can't on the way here in the Uber I pop in my headphones I just sort of you know whatever um I can't do that there I'm looking around at everything I'm aware every interaction becomes um important I'm having to make judgment calls in the moment there is some underlying level of danger and that in turn that uncertainty forces me into presence and awareness and makes my time consequential and I think that is life-giving and I think we do not have that in a way which is a good problem to have don't get me wrong here that is a good problem to have but I think when you think about the context your point of how humans evolved we live like that all the time cuz we didn't know where our next meal might come from very often we didn't know what the weather would bring we didn't know what was happening next and we were having to really work and uh struggle to survive and there is probably something rewarding to that and to be in the moment and to have to work to get the things that you get really on a deep level and be just kind of in it like you are in it you know and um yeah so I think that the takeaway for the average person is how is not to go to

[02:04:20] Baghdad let me say that it is how can you do things in your life that maybe reflect that a little bit I mean I think maybe uh you know we both like hunting I definitely get that from hunting you have to be present you have to be focused you have to be aware it's not exactly comfortable um I think people can get that from all sorts of things that they can do outdoors could be from volunteering like I'm going to go to this place I'm going to help others I'm

[02:04:48] I'm going to go down to this place I'm going to serve others right something that sort of puts you in the moment and makes you aware I think is important for happiness well Michael congratulations again on the book uh it's great I I'm not going to ask you what what you have percolating in your mind but I'm pretty sure you already have an idea for what the next book is so uh Glutton glutton for punishment yeah exactly um but I suspect that whatever you work on next will be an evolution of this type of thinking because it's clear you've really found um a sweet spot around exploring these important topics which I think both scratch kind of the investigative journalist itch which is you're basically learning a whole bunch of things in the field but on top of that there's a really practical takeaway for any one of us who reads it so um I suspect a lot of people listening to this are going to feel like scratched a little bit of the itch but they're going to go in need to read scarcity brain well thank you very much thanks for having me and then um I'll work on you so you can do your second book we'll see how it goes thank [Music] you
