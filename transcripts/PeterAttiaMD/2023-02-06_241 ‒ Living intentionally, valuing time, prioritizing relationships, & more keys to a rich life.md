[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Rick great to have you back and uh great to be spending time with you obviously we had dinner last night which was uh wonderful uh so thanks for coming to Austin that was such a treat last night uh getting to see you in full dad mode and beautiful family and great meal and lots of protein indeed lots of protein so uh although we're in touch constantly from the standpoint of the listeners the last time they got to interact with you was uh probably almost exactly three years ago 2019 uh so sometimes when I have folks back on especially if it's a technical podcast I kind of want to talk about okay well what's new information since that time well this obviously isn't very technical uh hopefully folks remember a lot of the story uh that we talked about um but nevertheless what's you know what do you think of as kind of the um the highs and lows for you of the last three years because I know there have been both gosh Peter go back uh to that time and and we had a specific conversation about leadership and we were talking about you know leaders our only leaders in a time of Crisis and we had talked about how the last decade had been super benign and you know how do we how do we show up in crisis and then 60 days later 90 days later boom covid hits so so a lot change if you think about it the last three years have been the most tumultuous three years no matter where you are in the world not in not in not in any one country um and then you layer that with lots and lots of changes um my kids have gone to college um my mother which we talked a lot about in the podcast and my father-in-law and my aunt which was like aess second mom all passed in that window uh our business went aggressively into offense when the market changed because we saw some opportunities we bought some very meaningful businesses and then you know everything kind of further imploded in one way and then you know now we're living in in the middle of a war in the middle of uncertainty and all of that but you know so the world like always keeps changing and surprising us uh we tend to project kind of today's reality into the future but it's always changing and how much of your um even

[00:02:27] Keel around all of these events personal and professional do you attribute to you know what happened in January of 2009 um in terms of perspective I mean yeah yeah I a lot you know I I really I don't have a lot of lows I you know and I don't have a lot of high highs I just to me is this this understanding that this two shall pass and um really doing what you can in the moment when you can is all that you really can do and if you don't tie yourself up to the outcome as much and you're just really trying to stay in the process I I I really I'm able to navigate this in great part because of that experience one of the things we spoke about in the first podcast that uh you know you always have these moments of podcasts that sort of stick with you and and that's probably true for a listener it's certainly true for the person doing the interview um there were a handful of moments one of them was this image of raising children is playing a game of tug-of-war that you have eventually lose now you can't lose it immediately right you can't just say ready go let go of the Rope right but by the time they're you know off to college they've pulled you over the line metaphorically um at the time we had that discussion you were still engaged in that tug of war that your kids were not yet in college now they are I'm in the middle of that game but I think about that constantly maybe start by retelling a little bit of that and and and explaining kind of if at all your thinking has evolved or what you've learned about that game in the last few years yeah so so that was probably the last meaningful lesson I got from my mom um she had you know onset of all ERS and you know we we would have moments of of of that and I I came and I was having coffee with her and I asked her some advice about our daughter who was in plenty teenagerhood and what she said was she said she looked at me and said my son uh raising teenagers is a tug of war and then there was this silence and then she says that you ultimately must lose um and it is you know like you said you know such a such an insightful you know all encompassing statement about parenting and it's really the transition from really being they'll always be your kid but you will not always be their parent and is that transition from now longer being them parent and maybe being more of a coach maybe be more of an advisor a friend all of that they'll you will always treat them like your kids so in our example we're on the other side of this um I I don't think of myself anymore as you know the parent I will always be that but I'm not the parent so the conversations are very different and I love it there have been times where both of our kids have looked at us and said I really appreciate your opinion but this is what I'm choosing to do and to me that's a sign of you know really good kind of sense of your own decisions and we disagree with them but it is like good to see them in their journey of of adulting uh now on their own yeah I don't know why I'm not looking forward to it but I it's one of those things that you know is healthy good important but you know but you have you noticed the difference in teenagerhood and how they start pushing away oh yeah and I've always believed that the reason why teenagerhood teenagers are such a pain is so that you don't miss them when they leave and I tell you we love our kids and we're lucky that our kids love us back but we were we high-fived each other when we dropped them off we did not cry we were like you know what they're ready we're ready and uh in empty nesting is it's a beautiful thing you know you still talk to them all the time and you still see them and all that so you know but it's uh then the funny part is that they're doing the same things that drove you crazy you just don't see it so it doesn't feel as as intense so let's talk a little bit about um well I want to bring up something that that happened kind of recently over the summer that I thought was spectacular so early summer you you you called me and said hey I'm I'm having a get together uh in July uh you know a couple of days and I'm inviting you know I you gave me a bunch of details none of which meant anything to me right what I took away from it was you wanted me to come out for a couple of days to to your home and there was going to be a bunch of other guys there at least one of whom I knew but most of whom I did not and you you know you prefaced it by saying look I know it's a big ask I know how much you hate to travel I know and you will have

[00:07:05] I had just come back from travel and I was just leaving the next day I would have to fly back and then hop right on a plane um but you really urged me to come and interestingly I thought it was a birthday yeah and so I I sort of committed that I would think about it and then talked about it with my wife and said you know I think this is special to Rick I'm going to go because

[00:07:30] I have a feeling it's one of those things where I'll spend the entire flight there kicking myself for going um but if I don't go I suspect months later I'll kick myself for not going so there's an asymmetry and regret yeah yeah so I ended up going um and it had nothing to do with your birthday which I think was like five months earlier so that I don't know where I got that from tell tell us about kind of what was the motivation for that and why do you think that ended up being a really special time for were there 40 of us there or something about 30 yeah 30 okay um you know when when when I when you go back through your year and you go back and ask yourself what was truly memorable of the year at least in my case there may be eight or 10 things that you will remember you know well into the future and what is universal about those things is they're usually experienced es and their experiences with people that you have a deep connection with so I have become very very focused on creating experiences with people that I love um as a way to create memorable moments of the year because I think that really is what we grow all with is the memories but the memories alone uh are not enough is the memories with people and the more kind of the Richer so I wanted to experiment with the concept of you know let let's create a friends Summit let's bring 30 super interesting friends the uniqueness of it is everybody's been curated by me everybody there was a friend so I think immediately everybody showed up with like okay if they're

[00:09:11] Rick's friends I'm I'm going to be open-minded I'm not there kind of doing like what do you do who do you are is more around how do you know Rick and then you know what is interesting about each other um and then you know we had a lot of the same participants speak and you know that we curated the the we didn't over orchestrate but we curated the agenda and then we had all sorts of things around food and magician and all this other stuff um and the greatest thing happened which is one of the things that I love most is when my good friends become great friends and I know for a fact because I was with Rick

[00:09:47] Hendrick a week ago and we spent 15 minutes talking about you about Matt Walker about other people that you guys all have become friends and what greater currency in life than you know spreading love through friendship and it was a huge home run because everybody there even those who came as a gift to me I think left with the gift of new friends and at our age it's not easy to make good new friends uh and it is something that we can do by leveraging our own friendships and and you've been good to me in this regard I asked you when I heard you know your interview with with uh with Matt I said hey would you introduce me and we had we become dear dear friends like I talk to him all the time so I don't know it's it's all around this currency that um friendships really matter in life memories you know memorable moments really matter and how do you bring all that together yeah no I I it was I was surprised by the the number of guys I walked away from that meeting with um who I couldn't wait to see again and you know it's like hey look when I'm in La

[00:10:52] I'll give you a call when you're in Austin you give me a call um what um what did you learn that that uh during that Summit because there were you know there was some structure to it as well where there were folks that you know was kind of like a bunch of Fireside Chats effectively um did anything surprise you did you learn anything I learned don't schedule something like that right after a vacation because I spent my whole vacation thinking about because I I I in essence kind of interview most people including you uh so that was a lesson which is you know create some gap between some in in your relaxing time um

[00:11:32] I learned that you know I think all of us no matter what NE moments like that where no matter who you are to the outside world you are you know you're the one and the same in that group so you know there were professional athletes there were Governors there were CEOs there were you know true people like our exception in their field like you but everybody there was the same so

[00:11:54] I I think that that this knows this essence of like you know no the guard can be down from everybody and you for me I got to like hang out with 30 of my best friends and give lots of hugs and catch up and have moments and create memories and you know relationships take a lot of effort and that was a really efficient way to like make huge deposits into a bunch of important accounts I'm blanking on his name but he he was the older gentleman on the very last day that spoke yeah um Walter green no wal

[00:12:29] Walter Marsh Walter was amazing in his own right and actually Walter's someone I want to have on the podcast um you should yeah so so you know it's really funny we used to be neighbors in San Diego and didn't even know it oh my goodness lived in the same neighborhood like lived a mile from each other I love

[00:12:46] Walter green you know Walter mentors I don't know hundred people like us and we're all better because of it yeah so so that's that's someone on our on our on our hit list for for podcast guest uh but yeah so Marshall who's like I don't know the guy's 200 years old 99 actually and um I think from Marshall came one of the most interesting lessons that you drew out and it's um a lesson about looking forward versus Looking Backward and how that ties to age do you want do you want to recount that story yeah so I know

[00:13:22] Marshall about 20 years um I've had I don't know a 100 lunches with Marshall um um and so when I met him he was probably 81 82 and he was still driving and he'll come in and um and there was something about Marshall there is something about Marshall that is incredibly appealing and attractive and is that every time you see him once a month every other month he has a list of things that he has learned that he wants to talk about he has ideas about things he wants to do um he's constantly evolving and thinking and what I've learned from Marshall is that your age really can be told by what you think about aging of our spirit not of our bodies not of our mind but of our spirit it's really about which mirror you're using are you using the rearview mirror or the windshield right and he is like you know I I told a story there right where he's like completely worried about one of his kids and really thinking about giving them a tough lesson because it is time and you know he's asking for my opinion and I said Mark I said

[00:14:31] Marshall how old is your son and he goes uh 72 so it was a point of like you know he never stopped thinking in in in in doing that and that's how he leaves list he turns 100 in uh in February and we're going to do something super special I hope because the other story I like about him was I think when he was 96 he came to you with a with a pretty serious business idea and it was really predicated on Trends over the next 10 years correct and it was like look today this isn't necessarily an enormous opportunity but here's all the data for why 10 years from now this is a home run we need to act now and make sure we build this business and you're sort of thinking you're 96 years old why are you thinking about a business opportunity that's going to you know Mushroom in the next 10 years you know and he was a senator for North Carolina for 26 years there's a highway name after him he you know he his his uniqueness he's a he's a um he's he's Jewish but he made all his money selling Christmas ornaments like all the things that are so unique about him um and he's incredibly close to his kids and his grandkids and you know he sees the world so clearly even when you talk about current events and politics today he has a wisdom about you know he literally played basketball at Duke in 1939 I believe right and you know he went to World War II like this guy in all of that you know and he's had tremendous hardships he lost his wife he's lost some kids and you know he the the dignity by which he handles it is just distilled in in a wisdom of life that I find super attractive I really think and again this is one of those there's like the soft science and there's the hard science you know I I spend most of my life thinking about the hard science of living longer the things that we can measure the metrics we can measure the biomarkers we can measure how we can predicate our assumptions of risk based on X Y and Z but there's simply no question that there are these soft metrics that we can't quantify but they must matter and

[00:16:42] I look at my dad as an example of this so my dad who is 85 years old not the healthiest guy in the world but he has outlived everybody in his completely unhealthy family by more than two decades and this is a guy who came from a family where there were you know nine kids one died as a child the other seven have all died again nobody came close to his longevity and to be clear he's not remotely a beacon of Health like even know your dad huh no no no wouldn't listen to a thing I've said if my life depended on it never mind the fact that his life depends on it um and look he probably doesn't have that many years left on this planet but I deep down believe that his relatively modest longev again relative to what I think his genetic capacity uh comes down to exactly this phenomenon is everything he never is looking back he is planning he is planning he is built he's got an idea I mean you know when he when he should have been retiring yeah he was you know he he bought quaries he bought like swaths of wow undeveloped Limestone land you know in his 60s with the idea that this is going to be you know there will be a demand for highquality Limestone

[00:18:03] Dolomite and granite in the next 30 Years and love it and that's what he's he's out there in a quarry every day barely able to walk because his knees are so you know messed up and I'm convinced to my greatest sadness that one day he's going to fall on these rocks and smash his head or something but yeah it it like the idea of just sitting around couldn't possibly occur to him let alone um you know relaxing now again we could talk about whether I think there's some maybe one should enjoy life a little bit more but for him

[00:18:37] I think enjoyment is building and is is is thinking about opportunity like well you know there's this Niche for this Market of limestone that nobody has really appreciated the value of and that's where he's going to pour himself into and that it reminded me of that story with Marshall right and I I have

[00:18:53] I've study uh a lot of people that are finishing life well 70s and 80s um because I'm I think we're all pretty predictable we just got to find patterns that we relate to that relate to us and I have lots of friends like you know Henry kravis is a very very good friend Henry is in his you know mid to late 70s and you know what he is a complete stud and I'm sure he's changed and evolved a lot uh as as you know as one of the great you know leaders in Wall Street but he is you sit down with him him and he has more energy and more passion and he's thinking more about the future and

[00:19:33] I think there's something to be saved by staying in the arena you know even if you downshift I think there's something to be say to you know your brain stays connected you stay relevant you don't feel all because you don't feel irrelevant um have you read Arthur Brooks's book from strength to strength

[00:19:51] I've read experts excerts I I listen to your podcast I talk to him okay I don't know him as well as you do but we know each other um but uh you know I think a lot of what he says it's it's around this and this crystallized intelligence that he talks about I think it's interesting because I I'm definitely I lack about 30 points of iqv to be the two of you like literally I listen to the podcast and I'm like all right I got to pause and go look at some stuff in the dictionary but I I I wonder if the you know to me the the crystallized intelligence is is more to me of the evolution of our brains and the Aging of our brain but a way that we stay productive for the tribe for the for the society more than a elevation of it is an evolutionary of um but that not notwithstanding I I I thought your podcast with him was tremendous thank you um I I I really enjoyed speaking with Arthur I enjoyed his book I read it twice and I and I really it it hit home a lot because even though you know I'm not yet 50 there's simply no question I don't have the horsepower I had when I was 20 I mean it's or 25 like where I feel like I was really at my cerebral

[00:21:06] Peak and I think you know as he talked about and wrote about the transition from fluid to crystallize intelligence it really gave me some comfort in accepting this transition so that to your point and why I brought this up is yeah I think it is important to stay on the field but I also think it's important to understand that it's okay to move to a different position well set well set and I I think that um replacing this notion of like I don't have the horsepower is redefining what that horsepower is and that gives us continued feeling of growth I think the importance of life it's really not necessarily the looking forward is constantly growing I think the day that you stop growing is the day you age yeah yeah I I I agree with that completely and you know this kind of brings it back to what we talked about a minute ago which is I mean I am sad when I think about my kids not being little and I'm not sure what that's about but uh you know we talked about it very briefly at dinner yesterday because you got to see both my boys in complete action right which we're we're not shy about right like we don't make any apology for the fact that they are high energy and and and we toally loveing you were so physical it was I I I really was so yeah I mean reminded me of my relationship but I also felt your joy and love but what what what what Jill and I often say to each other and this isn't you have to say this in the bad times so yesterday they were well behaved but you know there's equal number of times when I mean you'd think that they're psychotic I mean you you you can't believe how poorly they behave you know like all been there you know literally you will kill me for even even telling this publicly like the other day she walked by the youngest one and out of nowhere he just took his pencil and stabbed her in the butt unprovoked it's not like she said go to your room so it's like but in those moments I say I know it can be really hard yeah I will be I would if I could freeze time I would which is a totally irrational thing to say yeah why do you think that is why did you feel that way when you your kids were at this stage which is you are their world you're still Daddy not

[00:23:31] Dad right right I I think this is an amazing stage and I feel fortunate to be going through it a little later in life yeah when I think I can appreciate I think had I been presented with this 20 years earlier I wouldn't have had yeah the maturity to embrace it as much maybe no I I think that's I think that's right

[00:23:51] U you may not have the same energy you would have had but you have plenty and especially you I think that's the trade of that you that we have when we have kids younger or older you know I I think the great thing about having kids is we get to kind of almost relive life right and I think there's something very subconscious about you know rediscovering things or seeing things through their eyes that brings the child back in us you know I think that child is a safe place in all of our kind of personas uh I also think that there's this notion of this is how we are relevant in the world this is how we we are going to stay here when we're no longer here it's through them right because a lot of us will live through them and that's why we are so committed to it I me I I I just think that it's and it's such a powerful um job to have in responsibility that is heightened in every sense and the good and the bad and the reality is that you know all the things that they're doing are just normally growth moments of you know their own brain development and all that good stuff and um you know we talked a lot about it the last time in the podcast but you know I think we weigh over parents AR the youngest is uh he's just obsessed with math right now you know he's five he's starting to learn how to add and the other day we were sitting there and he he's he's sitting with me on the couch Reese is who's uh three years older is sitting you know at his desk doing some coloring and he goes you know when I'm a 100 Reese is going to be 103 and then he looks at me and he goes how old are you gonna be wait 70 and I go no I wish buddy I'm going to be long dead when you're 100 but if I were alive I'd be you know 140 whatever um but it's just first of all that's an amazing thought to me because I do think that kids today will quite easily be hundred years old right like I don't you know today to be 100 uh to make it to 100 right now is a pretty remarkable feat right uh um you know cenarius are exceedingly rare about 0.004% of the population um I tend to think that kids that are born now will reach that level at a far greater frequency uh and so it was a bit of a sobering thought right it's like I'm looking at this little chubby cute kid that I can't stop wanting to squeeze and hug and kiss and realizing he's going to be a hundred-year old man one day and

[00:26:24] I'll be probably long gone yeah um it's all of that stuff is sobering I guess it brings me to the to the idea of how do you I mean you you strike me as a person for whom a lot of purpose came from your kids yeah and so as your kids are older do you feel less of that and has does that has that caused you to put more of your sense of purpose into something we'll talk about later like philanthropy which is also very important to you uh I don't I I I actually I'm very challenged by this notion of how do I help evolve relationship into more of a coaching relationship um in a way that you know I can be still their father but also be a sounding board amongst you know many others and this morning I had a conversation with my son a lot around something he's dealing with and I said

[00:27:14] I'm going to talk to you as if you were a Mente of mine and I gave him what I thought as an advice I said you got to do whatever you want but I I want you to know that I am a resource for you uh and then you're not alone and so in this problems and just like you have other people and I I I've really enjoyed kind of this this morphing of the relationship it's early for us um so I don't I but by the way I think that's why people enjoy grandkids so much it's not that I can give them back when all that yeah yeah that that kind of really matters it's it's a chance to almost do it again right it do it again with lower expectations of like oh is it reflecting on me as a parent or is it all this stuff is just you know we have this innate desire to perpetuate ourselves and we do that through our kids yeah you've probably heard me talk about the Centenary in De cathlon and and for me one of the greatest motivations personally and I do find that for many of my patients because we talk about this in such detail um I think it's true for them also is what they want to be able to do with

[00:28:22] Offspring and more importantly the children of their offspring and um you've probably seen me do this but we do an exercise where you kind of build a timeline so you'll you know you put your age down and you know these are your kids and then you start to estimate the you know a bracket you know my kids will likely have kids when they are this age this age this age I will therefore be this age and you don't need to spend too long doing this to come to the realization that the things that you want to be able to enjoy doing with your grandkids uh will will range from kind of the really extravagant like I want to take them on the greatest vacation we're going to go to Egypt and we're going to scale you know the Great Pyramids and go down the Nile okay well that that's great alternatively it's going to be the really mundane like I want to be able to play catch yeah yeah yeah um you know it's interesting I wanted to share with you a story that I haven't shared yet which is you know in the in the after the the plane crash a couple weeks later

[00:29:24] I was watching my daughter perform in kindergarten it was a really important moment of the real estate of like for now this is my most important purpose which is to really kind of help my kids become adults and uh it it came full circle without me knowing it um I was at her graduation from high school uh she's a sophomore now in college and they're coming down and it was outside because of covid and they're coming down this kind of hallway in the same emotion that had not happened for I don't know 11 years happened I started balling uncontrollably as I saw her I didn't expect it it came out of nowhere I'm not a crier I'm I'm not afraid to cry but

[00:30:07] I'm not walking around and it was a realization that I had fin I had lived to the moment where she had become her own person and the graduation from high school was a lot more meaningful than just the graduation at least in my experience it was a realization that she can fly on her own now um and it was um it was a moment was a moment for me in in that realization but in also realizing that okay I now have more capacity to broaden purpose and I think we're all seeking purpose so it's not like you finish it it's just you evolve it uh and it was it was a I was very grateful to have had that experience because seldomly in life do you get to see the the end of the circle come back right it's usually a line that goes somewhere or nowhere so when we last spoke I think you you talked a little bit about um any any follow-up or interactions you've had with either the crew from from that flight or Captain solenberger himself uh what's what's the what's the latest on that I imagine that that that's a I don't remember how many people were on that Flight 154 plus the crew 5 158 to so there's 158 of you that uh I'm sure some people have passed away due to natural causes since but that's a very tight-knit group I'm guessing do you do you all collectively celebrate that anniversary together yeah there's there's always something and there's um

[00:31:33] Facebook groups and all that stuff I've been more On The Fringe I've participated in a couple things it's just time right for me and and I I got a lot of what I needed especially at the time from my closest you know kind of friends and family but you asked me at the last podcast um because we were presenting him that award at the point

[00:31:52] Sky event that I had you know have I seen him enough and why not and I told you that um I was planning to do something well uh it is it is happening and uh I don't know if you know this but the plane itself which it's worth seeing because it is banged up like a plane will be banged up if it hit a wall at you know 50 some miles an hour so it it really is not the plane it's it's just a shell of the plane sits in Charlotte and for a bunch of different reasons the all

[00:32:25] Hangar and Museum uh we lost all the facilities so the airport they were going to move the plane to Dallas because it ended up in Charlotte because that's where US Air was yeah based out so just by total coincidence in your backyard yeah and uh and then there was a lot of risk that we were going to lose and there's a bunch of other planes there but that's the anchor plane so a number of us rally in the community and is that normal by the way after a plane wreck that or do they I would have guessed that they normally scrap planes

[00:32:53] I think this one because historic value right um in uh in so a a group of people in Charlotte rally and and I made a donation with uh you know asking for the naming rights so the thing that I'm going to do to honor Sully and the crew and perpetuate you know kind of this notion I was doing my job remember that statement uh is we're going to name the museum after him and the museum will be in Charlotte in Charlotte so it will be the solenberger Aviation Museum of the

[00:33:21] Carolinas or something like that but it will be his name and I called him to ask for his permission um and he was was interesting hesitant at first and then he called me back and you know said okay let's do it and the uh the naming and all that will happen in January uh so it'll be a big 14th anniversary yeah MH and it'll be a beautiful day but you know I just I wanted to find something that you know will Outlast both of us and as a way to honor his commitment to doing his craft and to saving Our

[00:33:51] Lives yeah it's um I'm by this point in the podcast I think most people if they haven't arize yourself with themselves with the story should probably go back and listen to that that section of our podcast as the way I think you you tell that story this is probably the longest version you've told of it because obviously you have a TED Talk where you go through it in in in some detail which is really moving but I I think also just the you know I'm still so remember how I said from our first meeting there are a couple of things that stand out the other thing that really stands out from our first podcast which is something you sort of said in almost passing do you know what

[00:34:25] I'm about to say uh no CU I've I've shared this with you but it's when the plane is coming down and you're going through once you realize there's about 10 seconds until you're going to die um you said a couple things one it's very calm like it's you weren't scared you were sad you're very sad and you put your hand on your leg or on your other hand on your arm and said

[00:34:55] I love you MH is the last thing you said to yourself before you would have died close my eyes yeah and I was and I just couldn't believe that I was like that's the last thing I'd ever think to say um what would you have said I don't know that I I probably would have said nothing I probably would have just been very sad and um and and yeah I don't think there would have been any gratitude or anything like that in me have you have you actually asked any of the other people on the flight what they did said thought in the last 10 seconds no but I have and and and and I will because I think it would be interesting I I would mean there's a whole book there yeah like that for sure and and and remember that we had no suffering I imagine if you're dying you know in some level of distress it's it's a different you know your mind is in a very different place C but that's what makes this such an interesting quote unquote control experiment is yeah you weren't on fire yeah and it's 90 seconds so it's not all it's not not a you know a lot of people have near death experience it lasts a second or two seconds right um but I I I reflected a lot Peter on kind of the the Ted Talk was you know a moment in time and it was all around okay here's kind of the three regrets I felt as as the plane was coming down um and we talked a lot about them in the other podcast but I you know

[00:36:28] I we should revisit them by the way just so that folks can see it all in one place uh so so it was this notion that everything changes in an instant so time really really matters it was this notion that um relationships are at the core of the richness of life but yet we spend a lot of time with our ego you know kind of leading the charge and then this notion with around my kids which is I wasn't living true to kind of what I you know discover was my true purpose at the time or my main main purpose was just seeing my kids and it was the regret that I felt at the time of my look like death to had missed it to had not being clear that that really was the I don't know the the map or the or the or the you know the the key to living you know a better life you know as I reflect on all of that what's interesting is nothing has really changed but it's not around regrets you know I I I think um more yeah so you know for example I think in instead of it being around um Everything

[00:37:39] Changes in an instant so you know living the moment it is that but is wrapped around around um a notion of having true intentionality about how we live our life and true intentionality about how we live a a life is a really big deep bucket that I've spent lots and lots of time thinking about it has a lot to do with time right and the reality with time and and I've heard this and I love it is like the problem with time is the same problem that we have most things that are free we don't value it right if we like had to get up and like really spend real money on time I bet you we will behave differently right and the problem with time is as we have learned about sleep is you have to do a lot of things to extend your time some so that you're more productive the next day like sleep and some like nutrition and exercise so that you have more time right so a lot of what you are really trying to do is you know convince people that there are things they can do to have more quality and and meaningful time but it is a lot more than that you know to me to live with intentionality is around um kind of combining a lot of things into where we spend our energy and what the things that we stop doing and how how do we kind of reverse things that we don't want to do so um I I really think that this notion of having complete intention um is is really at the core of living a a more rich life so I feel my life to be very rich because um I do I have like for example

[00:39:16] I I have 242 weeks left until I turn 60 and you know I have all these little exercises where I say okay you know what are my like big intentions this week because you know at 60 I'm in a different energy level I'm probably paying a bunch of physical debts back like there's a lot that will come back and you know and and I live in chunks of my life with just great intention it is because of that because I realize that everything really is you know fleeting but it's not just around time and time only and and that manifest itself think in the second one when you talk about when I you talked about relationships um what I realized is that you know a little bit of the event that we were talking about

[00:40:02] I I want to continue to meet new people that I can learn from I am addicted to learning and growth and the best way to do that is through other people so the amount of energy I put into friendships because it's not relationships you know the good news is when you're in business you have a lot of deal friends the key is how do you convert them into real friends who do you want to convert into real friends and to be a real friend talk about about a skill to be learned right talk about it being a never ending Journey uh and and how do you approach that so I'm I'm really really I have an enorm amount of great friends more than most because I spent the bulk of my time on that and if you go back to time there's only three things you can do with it you can waste it which a lot of teenagers do you can use it in things that are you know value and then you can invest it there's nothing else you can do with time so the ratio of what you do with those three components has a lot to do with it so guys like you and I at least we don't waste a lot of time the question is how much are you using it for things that gives you pleasure or things that you want to do and how much are you investing and that will ultimately continue to pay dividends in life so like if you look at your time you'll know how much of that it is and if you're using too much in something at some point becomes wasteful if if you may so relationships are super rich and then the last thing is you know this notion of purpose is how do you kind of expand so I spent a lot of time trying to continue to evolve the gift and not look at it as a as a moment in time but as a as a some level of a map into the into the future and as I continue to age what do you think the next um decade holds for you in terms of Red Ventures so maybe give us a bit of an update on um well maybe again remind people what Red Ventures is because it's yeah it's not a it's not an easy thing to explain it's not like we make a widget no it you know it's funny because I explained it in the last podcast three years ago differently than I'm going to explain it now it it really is a basically a private Equity platform of companies that we control so instead of investing as a passive investor we control a bunch of companies and we have about 17 companies um but you know the those companies the fact is we don't own 100% of them but we control all of them and they're all over the place they're in Europe in Brazil we're starting the first Bank in Puerto Rico in 26 years and then we own a bunch of brands in the

[00:42:31] US mostly digital brands we own services companies so it's it's just really a platform of um kind of tech and data and digital and a really really strong culture and a purposeful place to work how many employees do you have now we are up to 4500 employees and when I came out to visit you for a business review circa 2014 m 2015 how big were you then 1 1200 1 1200 beautiful campus thank you it's still the same still beautiful it's just people are not going in as often you the world has really changed our relationship with world with work has really changed um and I you know for both like anything in life everything has pros and cons I I think Co did a lot of good for society I think Co realized that this fixed way that we thought thought about our relationship with work they have to be and that those rules got established way early in the Industrial

[00:43:34] Age for control and control is a false premise in every regard um but at the same time I I'll tell you my reflection on this and what I worry about a little bit and I know a little bit of a different topic but I think that one of the unique things about the us and you don't see this in a lot of other countries having studied a lot of Latin

[00:43:56] American countries is that you know the decade between 20 and 30 is a decade of true apprenticeship and that all this companies and corporations and Hospital Systems they're really training people into their second third of Life uh so you spend the first decade of your life hopefully if you're lucky you have good enough parents where you learn a lot then School becomes a place you work and then whatever your profession is that third decade of life is incredibly important uh and that's where you really built a lot of death and learn on someone else's nickel and all this stuff and I worry that we're going to look back in 10 years and the us would have lost a sense of competitiveness because a lot of this people coming into the workforce are getting a fraction of the tutoring and coaching and experiences and intuition that they would have had and 30 40 years from now we would have lost a lot of our Edge because we stopped investing in the people and their creativity and their skill meaning that's a downside of not being being in an immersive culture at least for that for that for that segment of the or that age of the population now I would argue that you know I think what we learn in

[00:45:06] Co is flexibility is King and we should celebrate and look for flexibility and we shouldn't be able to sacrifice raising kids if you're a working mother or working father you know to the the sacrifices that we made or we don't have to travel crazy like we were traveling so a lot of that is you know baked into you know Chang in the in in the Rules of

[00:45:28] Engagement but this this is all a moment in time you know if we go into a recession some of this habits May return I hope we never lose the flexibility we gain I don't love going to work every day at the same time and leaving at the end of the day I love having a lot more freedom and I think most people do do we know if I mean presumably there are certain jobs that work really well remotely versus not and there are presumably certain types of people who work really well remotely versus is not yeah I don't I I don't and haven't spent much time sort of looking at any of this but I imagine given the size of your company and the footprint of Red

[00:46:05] Ventures do you have any insights into that you know I think there's two components to that one is productivity which is you know at least in some functions fairly easy measured and you know so we have lots of editors that write um you know real content they they are as productive or more if they don't have to commute and do lots and lots of things that are distracting in the office office um there are some places in engineering where that is also true maybe some of the places in the back you know back in engineering where you're not doing a lot of collaboration um but by and large uh and those people net net you would argue that you know remote not hybrid very different things uh you know netn net may be more positive now the second side of that equ question I think being alone or being in your home um every day has a real tax and mental health I think we we are we're we're designed to be with others and I don't think we know the real value you or or tax on that um now a lot of the other jobs hybrid in my opinion uh where you're collaborating with people where you're learning experientially where you're building intuition um it's it's a healthier way uh to gain expertise on something do you mean hybrid like you come in sometimes and you work from sometimes yeah and there's a lot of things we do during the week that you don't need to be in a place but you know so so my My Hope Is that ultimately work de evolves into what are the things that require people to be together versus what are not and then depending on where you are in your career and your you know your proficiency you have even more flexibility how long do you think you'll be doing Red Ventures as your quote unquote day job versus working on some of the many things that seemingly are of just as much interest to you but are more on the nonprofit side you know I I feel super healthy in great part thanks to you I literally I feel like I've at least slowed down a lot of the Aging uh and and uh and I'm really grateful um the uh so as long as

[00:48:24] I feel healthy I I love this perch I don't back to the Marshall conversation I don't intend to you know I never want to replace happy with happier in anything in life and I'm happy as can be you know and you know would it continue to evolve yes would it continue to you know change and you know the one of the the big ahas in Co you know Co to me was unique in so many ways I when I got to do something for a second time which we usually don't do in life when something kind of goes away goes away the fact that we got our kids home for like a year and a half uh it was it was it was wonderful but you know I think the the the for me Red Ventures will continue to evolve but what will happen is a lot of our companies will kind of gain independence so instead of Red

[00:49:11] Ventures being one thing we will find the right outcomes and you know and in marriages of a lot of our businesses with the right partners and allow those people that become CEOs of their own businesses and will create monetization and return for our in investors but our ability to stay private and stay independent and stay away from all the other stuff that public companies have to deal with it's non-negotiable so I see Red Ventures in a bizarre way returning to its roots in the next 25 years to a much simpler um thing where most of our businesses will evolve out we'll continue to buy businesses in the next 10 years but my guess is when I turn 80

[00:49:50] I'll I'll have 15 people and we will be hoping to give all our money away speaking of giving money away uh you've recently signed the giving pledge yeah about a year a a year and a half ago so tell us a bit about that I mean I think people have heard of the giving pledge but what what what does it mean and what type of people can sign it and what what are the implications of it you know it was it was not something that we did without a lot of trepidation you know we had uh it's something that really um Bill and Melinda Gates and

[00:50:24] Warren Buffett started and it was um around creating consciousness of the people that have had more luck than others and creating real wealth to um create a commitment and responsibility that you will give at least 50% of that wealth back that's what the pledge is about um and that you would that's during your lifetime as well correct yeah or or when you die it doesn't matter but you are you know committing that's that's the pledge you sign and there's hundreds of people that have signed it all over the world right so it's a bit of a community too where you learn how to give it in ways that reflect what you want to do and all of that so there's real value to being part of the community uh when we first you know met and we we had we had the privilege of having dinner in Omaha with

[00:51:07] Warren Buffett and they were trying to convince people at the time our kids were still in high school and we want this burden because it it it does create negative energy around it and they you know because a lot of people and meaning because it makes public the amount of it a threshold uh which at the time we were we were private company so no one had known but when the New York

[00:51:30] Times wrote an article and all this stuff it kind of became public what it was but it's just more I I wanted to shelter them from anything that negative that may come out of that and it's just not they were too young so we waited until they went to college so when they went to college um they called back and said hey you said when your kids were go to college you do it and so we uh when we did and and we're grateful we did but you know we we plan we were planning to do this anyway and we do it more as a you know as a as a pledge that hopefully others realize that this only works if it works for everybody it doesn't work if it works only for a few and you know putting it back into the system in the core that's what you're hoping to do did you ever hear the podcast I did with

[00:52:12] John Arnold I did not okay so definitely one you'll want to listen to so John and Laura Arnold um who've also signed the giving pledge are probably two of the most deliberate philanthropists I've ever met um John uh was was I think you could say hands down the most successful energy Trader in the history of energy trading wow um and he um he was a he was a um a Trader at Enron right out of college and became their most successful

[00:52:41] Trader in fact I I if I'm not mistaken I think his personal book of business was generating a billion dollars a year for Enron just his own personal trades uh when Enron imploded you know he was handed a severance check of something like $5 million and he took every penny of it put it into his fund and went on a 10year tear of unparalleled returns something like 30% per month oh per month okay so you know at the time that John shut his fund down which I think was 2011 or 2012 before the age of 40 uh he basically completely turned himself to what he's been doing for the last 10 years which is just philanthropy but doing it with a level of rigor and analytics that um in other words he's done something that I think is really interesting and highlights something really hard which is it's actually not that easy to give away billions of dollars um I mean if you want to do it intelligently I mean you can obviously give money to entities that you know build buildings you know um build a hospital th those things are those things are great but you know when you look at the sort of projects that JN is interested in um it takes time and I think John and his wife correctly came to the realization that they can't wait until they're you know right 65 to start doing this they will run out of time because they have too much money um how do you think about that balance um because I know there are things that you were really committed to maybe we can talk about some of those things the two that jumped to mind of course are uh the children uh you know sort of

[00:54:29] I forget the exact name for undocumented kids who who are you know born or not born here but brought here young educated here and then can't work um and then of course a lot of the disaster relief in Puerto Rico but also just infrastructure and building up there so let's let's talk a bit about these things so first I I I I really think that only governments have the muscle to really solve problems and I think even people with the wealth of Bild and

[00:54:57] Melinda Gates have come to a lot of that conclusion you can attack singular problems and maybe you know eradicate a disease or something like that if you have billions and billions of dollars but through systemic issues I think the role of any you know nonprofit is to gain momentum to create a road map to create the case for governments to really put real funding behind things or create the systemic changes to change it so I don't I don't think that the illus illusion of like we're going to fix a real isue isue to me this is more around but but there is something you or and when I say you I don't just mean you personally but I mean there are there is something that the philanthropist can do that the government won't do which is you can take a risk financially that a government can't do you can demonstrate a proof of principle that as you said then becomes a template or road map for a policy maker to say well here's a pilot study that was done that demonstrated X Y and Z this was very high risk we never would have done it but oh my god look what we learned this is now something that could be replicated at scale and you bring in so in other words the the private uh the philanthropist can effectively function as the angel investor or the early stage

[00:56:07] VC and the government comes in as the PE investor yeah yeah um and in that regard I think you bringing an entrepreneurial spirit and and and putting real kind of business savviness behind it is really important so I I I do believe that but I I love the I think it was Jeff bezel a long time ago he said something around you know in in in in philanthropy you're not really necessarily looking for the perfect business plan you know if you're helping somebody you're doing good and and that's a little of my Approach like do things that are good for the world and good and and it's good for one person then you're doing something and trying to do it in scale and with purpose and and all of that um as it relates to what we're doing Peter it's you know it keeps evolving you know we we've now we're really really focused on this um you know 16 to 24 that's our concentration on people that are under resource and it is more than undocumented kits although we just closed our applications again and these kids are still in limbo meaning you know there's there's still there's no path to anything they just have this basically uh permit that gets renewed but no one can get the perit anymore so every year about 80,000 kids are graduating high school that you know have no ability to get a work permit it's just insane it it is insane and so just so people understand these are kids that came here undocumented so they're born in another country they've come here they've grown up here though they've gone to high school here they could go to college but they wouldn't get financial aid because of course they're not residents um so tell me what actually happens what how many of them say I have to go back to the country I was born in versus I'm going to get in college and somehow take a bunch of debt uh without any financial aid like my my guess is that 95% of them end up taking minimum wage jobs or kind of um jobs that are you know underground and and stuff like that like where we're where where because you really you know now there was a process there where you can get a daaka permit and there's there's 650,000 of these kids that have

[00:58:17] DACA permit so you can you can work unfortunately about that you know in the last Administration dhca got rescinded so there's no new Dhaka so if you're a high school student you're 17 you know you can't get a a work permit so at that point you were grow you grew up here your family's now here going back to your original country country origin may happen but it's really really hard you have no roots there you have no resources you may not even know the language for that matter right so I think that that's the that's the craziness of this we we what's the distribution of where these kids are from do we have a s probably 90% Latin

[00:58:52] America um probably 2third of those Mexico just because of how they come in illegally um but you but you see them a lot from Southeast Asia and other places we just our our yearly scholarship uh Grant we just got 1,200 applicants uh literally close last week I believe over 300 of them have uh close to a 4.0 on you're providing scholarships for these kids to go to college because they don't need to be residents to go to college they just need the funding the funding yeah so you don't get in you don't get federal financial aid and about half the states don't give in state tuition so it's almost like you would have to go to school as a you know to a private school and pay 60 70 grand a year and is the investment you're making Rick that if these kids crush it in college they're going to get an H1B visa on the back end or they're going to they're going to land in some legitimate dual intent Visa with a path to citizenship based on their education well until three years ago because of were old Daka they had a path to getting jobs and there's many now that have jobs right we we we put we have 520 kids in the program about half of them are graduating but we keep thinking this is the last year this is the last year because Congress Congress just needs to pass a law right and you know they there's plenty of reasons why it hasn't happened but now the kids that are going to start graduating next year they're literally in limbo because they can't get a work permit so the H1B visa and all of that can't do it you can figure out a way to marry and then take that route you can look for Asylum but those are all really really hard paths I didn't realize that so you're telling me that if a kid goes through a scholarship oh because they're not doing it on an F1 that they're not Dhaka like

[01:00:39] Dhaka was um yeah exactly that that expire doesn't exist that's the argument now is like not only do you have the daaka kids in limbo but now you're like you know this 80,000 kids every year that we and the crazy thing is we invest in them in primary school and secondary school we don't ask the question when they go to our school systems but then you know we invest all that money why don't we make them taxpayers you know we we have an issue there's like this massive decline of kids applying to college we have all this college infrastructure with not enough students to they why why not educate them and make them pay taxes and give them a path whatever that is to citizenship so to me this is one of those things that makes absolutely no sense but to what we did is we expanded that to you know after the George Floyd event we we as a company kind of rally around we we have to find Opportunities into our inner cities and have used a lot of the same platform to broaden it it's called road to hire where golden door Scholars is a part of it but here's something really cool we we start teaching coding uh in North Carolina um mostly black and brown students mostly from Title One schools we're going to the high schools and start teaching there uh and then we do an apprenticeship program and then we partner up with all the corporations in

[01:01:56] Charlotte we are graduating more black and brown kids with computer science expertise than the whole North Carolina system is now this year we have over 220 of these kids graduating and they all have jobs on the other end so we give them an apprenticeship and then we have a whole the from sorry these are high school or college no these are these are um they're not going to these are kids that are 22 23 24 mostly black and brown kids that we're teaching them how to code we pay them to teach High School grads that didn't go to college we give them a two-year apprenticeship where we're paying them on behalf of all this

[01:02:31] Corporation and it's working tremendously here's the crazy thing this 21y old kid who was driving Uber after two years of the apprenticeship they are as competent in technology as someone who graduated from NC State now um how do you think that can be scaled what do you think is the Magic in that that t this is a great example of what we said earlier you can't solve that problem across the country but can you provide a road map for that well there's like you start with the jobs like and at the end of the day there's you hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs that are unfilled because they don't have the skill so pick this by the way it's the same thing with high school teachers today there's a shortage of like I believe is 350,000 teaching you know vacancies that is projected to be but we yet we pay 42,000 in Most states and you can't exit crazy right but but keep on technology where there's there's a big gap the the reason our system our B our our model

[01:03:33] Works in Charlotte and North Carolina is because it rides on the rails of the system it literally partners with the county and it with the city it partners with the schools with the high school systems all Title One it connects to the um to the public school so like there is a lot here and then the corporations all basically offer a job on the other end the key to this is to start with the job and then train into the job versus start with education and hope they get a job so go fill the job that is not getting filled yeah uh and by the way solve the diversity challenge that all these corporations have solve a lot of the other issues but don't show up into the you know into into the nonprofit arm of a corporation solves a problem that they really have and that's the connection so

[01:04:19] I think it it will have to happen more at the city level so there's a big initiative uh call 110 that a number of like high-profile CEOs have built to try to do this it just takes a long long time and my my concern is when the economy turns these are the kinds of things that get scrapped um these are the kinds of things that people stop giving that job for or investing in yet we go back to this you know negative spiral that that we tend to have obviously you and I both are kind of cut from the same cloth which is that of immigrants and um

[01:04:56] I think with that comes a little bit of disbelief as to why the US would not as a as a country want to embrace an amazing asset um do you see this changing do you see this as just being a season um I do you know I I'm super optimistic on our country you know that you know for as flawed as we are I I would rather be nowhere else yeah I agree with that and you know this just things unfortunately take time you know I'm reading a book called Brothers about you know the kennedies and you realize that there were real serious issues there around you know the mob and like all these things that you know we don't hear about today so I I I do believe that the trend line is up it's just not linear and it's not fast enough so um you know and I think we just have more information much of which if not all of most of which is noise that distracts us a little bit yeah so so so I think back in the' 60s there's no question it was a more tumultuous era I mean there were political assassinations on us soil right right like we don't have anything like that today um KN on but but the noise today is unbearable The Never Ending cycle of nonsense news cable social media I think makes it feel more dramatic um but that could also be the undoing right

[01:06:27] I mean you know and these are pendulums I think we are at a pendulum right right now where the country is super divided I am s i I believe that there will be a series of leaders in our future that will bring us back together we need a common enemy and you know maybe it is this risk of China that becomes our ganizing thing you know why why you know

[01:06:49] I I I find it super interesting when there's a real crisis in our country 9/11 or even you know Co at the beginning like we all kind of are behave like Americans uh and then you know we need something that brings us back to being Americans and not Republicans Or democrats or black or white and all that stuff and common enemy tends to do that and I think this uh this peaceful times have allowed for a lot of room for us to subdivide so Rick let's let's uh let's pivot a little bit to talk about health which is um you know you're a very health conscious guy um but but there's also been some changes I I think in your life over the past I don't know I think

[01:07:31] I've known you now for nine years um basketball used to be kind of the only thing you did for exercise which was great because it kept you running around a court but you know you can get be prone to injuries and things like that um how would you describe overall kind of your mentality towards your your health your longevity what changes have have you made one of my favorites which

[01:07:55] I'm sure you'll get to is your approach to your body weight which cracks me up it is um you know I I realized that I want to be here for as long as I can and I want to be here in as you know active of a way as I can so I I I really um I'm committed to that you know it's this notion of time but it's time on the other way um so for the first time ever in the last you know especially in the last four years I've gotten into the gym and I have a trainer and we go through it I don't do the crazy stuff you do but

[01:08:28] I would argue that I am so much stronger from grip to balance to all the things and you know I try my version of it because I I don't consider myself to be an elite kind of athlete in that regard but I feel so much better um I transition from basketball so I play my last official pickup game about three months ago and I had a bunch of pros come and it was great because he has been such a great language for me and so many relationships came through basketball so much self learning and self-awareness and I now picked up tennis and you know you know now why did you do that I mean why why did you completely stopped playing your favorite sport because I watch a lot of people my age um just blowing Achilles and a knee and all of that and you know what those are all signals that we should listen to

[01:09:16] I didn't want to get to that place and now the more I play the more my knees were sore and you know my body's talking to me it actually talks to us all the time and I wanted to leave on my terms and I wanted to leave knowing that you know it it served its purpose and it doesn't control me and I love I I picked up tennis in the pandemic and it's something that we're doing more as a family but I I love the apprenticeship the struggle so I have a coach I go twice a week it's a great workout I get my heart rate to 130 get to zone two I stay there for an hour so I get a lot of

[01:09:47] ACC you know multiple values and and I'm really not good and you know footwork is different everything is different and I love the grinding of you know things and it's a reminder of humility like you know everything that we now take for granted that we think we're so good at at some point was really really hard so

[01:10:05] I have now a list of things like I you know it's embarrassing I'm Puerto Rican I don't know how to dance salsa like I can't die as the only Puerto Rican who can't die by Dan salsa so I have a list I I want to you know even last night you were grilling and I'm like I used to grill a lot more and so I have this notion now that I I want to keep learning things I have a list of about eight or nine things uh and eventually if we end up living part of the years in another country that language I want to try to engage in and it's just this notion I don't want to get old but I want to get don't want to get old not by my age but I don't want to get old by stop so I want to talk about that last game of pickup basketball how sad was that zero really no I'm grateful for what I had not because it ended it's life you know I don't you know it it kind of leads to the biggest self growth

[01:10:56] I've had since the plane was in that middle bucket of like relationships and what I realize Peter is that the most important relationship we have the most important friend we have is ourselves and that unless we get that right everything else will have a lot of friction everything else will be a version of a a a worst version of what it can be and what I realized as

[01:11:28] I study this is that we in society and it's I think it's almost every religion I want to say almost all be and all because I don't know but most religions that I know are anchoring some level of guilt and guilt as a way of teaching us or as keeping us connected to something and I've realized that guilt is the most useless emotion one can have and I have spent the last five years just basically getting rid of guilt to the point that I joked it's a complex I no longer suffer from I still have others but I feel no guilt and when you feel no guilt what you realize is that you can change the dialogue that you have with yourself I am super kind to myself I constantly make mistakes I constantly do things that I'm like oh gosh that wasn't right or I don't show up the way I need to show up but I I have I have nothing but love myself I will say thanks yeah that wasn't your best okay what next one it is help me understand that so so you it's hard for me to imagine you showing up as poorly as I can but let's say you you're in sort of a pissy mood you come home yeah you had asked your wife to do something earlier it's not done instead of saying hey sweetie did you did you have a chance to do that thing I asked you to do before you sort of snipp at her yeah I don't know if you've ever done that it happens yes okay how do you because it's I think it's really easy to feel bad and feel shame for snapping at her and then that actually impairs your next interaction so how but how do you break that cycle I own it I because it just takes a little time it's like I'm sorry I just took out something on you that it was not on you that was unfair I hope you forgive me how long does it take you to man up to that it's not long you know maybe 20 minutes 30 minutes like like like you're very self-aware like and and you can read body language you know like you know you can see that what you just said kind of cut through in a way and then you're like huh what what did I do but but but more importantly is I don't

[01:13:34] I don't feel bad like I don't I don't carry this notion of like oh my goodness I I just did this even like even if I do something that I didn't want to do I just said okay just it's part of Being Human it's part of growing up it's part of learning it's part of your Humanity but do you think that that can only happen because you're able to immediately make amends I think it's a habit I think we we we walk around so how do you break that habit then I mean guilt is a pretty strong habit for a number of people I'm sure yeah um it's like any habit it may be worse than smoking smoking is hard I never smoke but it's a really Hab but if you want to break it you break it you know you're 98% of your thoughts are with yourself so first of all you got to be very aware of all your thoughts and you got to be able to objectivize what you're hearing and you have to be able to evaluate and say you know what is this productive is this helping me or am

[01:14:31] I doing this because I've always done it or because this is how my parents kind of related to it and I think the more we move away from the emotion of guilt and become it it becomes selflove it becomes you know a notion like the safest place for us to be with ourselves uh in the kindest place to be is in our own heads and there's no judgment there's no anything like life becomes so so much simpler and then that that you give yourself you can give to others CU you know when we talk about purpose you know we're very lucky that we can impact people through your platform you're impacting lots of us and you know I'm lucky that in my platform I can impact people but you impact people every day with little things how you show up to the coffee shop in the morning the type of connection that you make the taking time like all of that is making an impact and the more that you feel a peace and sigh the more you want to give it so I am now addicted really to like good energy and that doesn't mean it's maybe 95% of the time but oh I love that place and I give it and I give it freely and I give it with you know not expecting nothing in return and to me this is like the happy place I live in a happy place what do you think is the relationship between happiness and wealth um do you think they're uncoupled do you think they're correlated positively do you think they're correlated negatively I think we decide what they are you know I think you know some of the happiest people in the world have no wealth so they cannot be coupled now wealth can give you a set of conveniences that allows you to solve for whatever your priorities are that you know might may may heighten your ability to do that and therefore it gives you more happiness or like in many people you pursue wealth your whole life because that's what our society wants once and when you get there you just feel so empty and then you feel so guilty for all you sacrifice for it and you're in the worst place which is you got what you wanted and it was a mirage and it meant nothing and there are so many people out there that feel like oh my goodness I was running the wrong race you know we talk a lot in life Peter around the best way to run a race no one steps back and asks am I running the right race and I think really focusing on you know re-evaluating in the race you're running so when you ask me questions about you know Red Ventures in 10 20 years I made it very clear after my you know my plane event that I was going to run a different race than everybody else I wasn't looking for you know being public I wasn't looking for being the wealthiest I wasn't looking for my race was to enjoy the race and to enjoy the race I am crazy so I love growing I love being challenged I love competing but I I I give no power to anybody and I try really hard not to take power away from anybody what do you think are the ways that that people even inadvertently take power away from people you know we as

[01:17:35] Leaders you know can can over lead uh and not let other people's have you know kind of the the let them be celebrated and not take all the all the all the credit for things or on contrary take responsibility for things that may not have been truly your responsibility so I think I think leaders have an ability to really um manage the the kind of the power equation with intentionality um I think how you treat somebody like I think uh we talked about this in the last conversation but I think the best way we can parent is by showing our kids how to treat strangers and how we you know give people respect no matter who they are what they're doing and how do we not give anybody too much respect just because Society made them be something you know everybody puts their pants on the same way everybody has insecurities everybody has issues you know when you look at people as like you know we all are in this like imperfect Journey with imperfections it just makes it really kind of level field and and and simpler one of the really enjoyable I mean there were so many but C certainly one of the enjoyable highlights of the friend

[01:18:49] Summit was when Simon snek got up and talked about finite versus infinite games which of course is the name of a a book um maybe for folks that aren't familiar with that I know it's a book that you love as well um how do you implement uh that ethos into yeah both your business and your your life you know when Simon sent me an early book and said hey what do you think I it was almost like he was writing what it was in my brain I just don't have an ability to write a book but he wrote a book I'm like and he he actually was rewriting a book by somebody that had come before right he had put it in more modern terms um and it became kind of codifying a language that I really believe in and that the core of the infinite game is that there's a bunch of principles of the game and how you play the game and all of that but the core of the infinite game is that there's no winning that the whole objective of the game is to stay in the game the reality is if you really read into it the the real real Ultimate objective is not just to stay in the game but to perpetuate the game so what you're doing through your podcast through your book that's coming out through your kids through everything else is you're perpetuating the game you know the game that matters to you and that's living with purpose because you are now you have a purpose of what you're doing I feel the same way so when you give up the winning or losing when you don't look at things you give away a lot of the you know the jealousy like I don't feel jealousy like I don't like it's it's it's an emotion that I am like you know just because you have it doesn't mean I don't have it um you know may be a little envious at time I like wow I wish I had the knowledge that

[01:20:37] Peter has about this stuff but zero jealousy right so the infinite game it makes it really really simple not to get caught up on winning or losing just makes it and like just play the game and therefore we give away we get away from back to this notion of like oh you know I came in second I came in third and you and I have talked a lot about this kind of stuff it's like and by the way I don't think it affects the outcome at all you know I think you end is that something that you have the luxury of playing because you run a private company but if if if Red Ventures were a public company would you be able to to to to live by that or would quarterly earnings and other metrics that shareholders would be privy to and have an interest in change that in other words do do public markets demand winning I I think by and large yes now you could argue that Jeff beas at Amazon forever never made money even though the public markets were demanding that he did this and he basically said no I'm not I'm going to continue to lose money and you either going to like my story or not um you you could argue that Elon

[01:21:48] Musk is playing the infinite game in many ways with the decisions he's making even even Mark Zuckerberg yeah like with meta like you know he clearly has 75% of the value of the company so I think you can do it you just have to have the temperament and the stomach to be unpopular and you know what the best way to be that to not be unpopular is not to read I don't read anything about us about me like I it doesn't matter the opinion of a stranger has zero value to me now if you call me and say dude I I heard you say this or do this and that feels it's like not you I will listen cuz I know that you know me and you care so like I have no desire to be popular with people I don't know I want to re be respected by people that I care about that's an amazing lesson that to me is a very difficult feature of living in the world today right it's do you do you look at what people are saying about you on social media do you read comments um not very often but a little bit um

[01:22:56] I again I I I would say I'm probably 95% compliant with the notion of ignoring it and when I do read it I'm rarely perturbed by it largely for the reasons that you put forth which is you understand that it's kind of irrelevant yeah um but I can't imagine what it would be like to be doing that from a real stage right I mean look I'm kind of a nobody but I mean could you imagine being

[01:23:25] Mark Zuckerberg for example you know I think he doesn't care yeah meaning he's a made man at a place where whatever you know but I think I think it's all IR relevant Peter like there is no stage that is different or bigger than ours like there is just different stages just because someone is has a bigger platform than we do doesn't make their stage more important than our like we're all the same no I think it just means that the the the attacks are louder potentially but doesn't matter if you don't read them if you stay true to yourself it is all circular logic yeah have you imparted a lesson like this on your kids

[01:24:01] I mean they're we've talked about this a little bit on our first discussion right you you made an interesting point that I think is uh I've thought a lot about actually I think I had historically thought of it as our kids have it so much easier than we did because you know we came from Little they come from Plenty you know reasons going on you made a I think it was the I think you framed it this way but this is certainly how I think about it is I feel like me from my parents from their parents from their parents there was an inevitable Trend that the child would exceed the accomplishments of the parents that was just the nature of moving from the Industrial Revolution right to now and maybe it's our kids that will be the first one for whom it's not just going to be falling off a log to the accomplishments of their parents in whatever metric we use to think about that and you you came at that from a real point of empathy which is I want to make sure my kids aren't under some unnecessary unrealistic pressure that they have to do something that their parents did um say more about that and has has how has your thinking sharpened it's it it it stems from the premise I think our kids have a lot more Comfort they have a lot more access they have a lot more experiences but that's different you know if if you're defining this about feeling a level of satisfaction with life or a level of

[01:25:37] Happiness back to what we've been talking about there's two separate things they're divorced from one another they don't they shouldn't tie I think the fact that we're starting with the premise that achieving more than your parents financially is the objective of life it's like a goofy starting point right I I think what I would love my kids is to feel like they you know were able given the opportunity to really find their gift uh and to do it with in a place of love and that they are great parents and then as a result you know we as a family did good in the world and I

[01:26:12] I tell you it it is to me all none of these things kind of make any sense when people are like oh you know we're you know I just think it's hard it's hard when you know you are Peter ata's daughter uh or Peter ata's son and you know I think we should be mindful of that not because it's a burden that it's put on them by others that they don't know how to accept you know um that's what I really meant by that so I don't I saw a really interesting clip um

[01:26:41] I'm sure we'll be able to find it for the show notes it was Arnold Schwarzenegger a very young Arnold Schwarzenegger so I'm guessing he would have been late 7s early 80s so had had had already accomplished a lot but obviously had more to accomplish right this is before he would have become the world's biggest movie star and go on to become the governor um but he was being asked and I think it was like Barbara

[01:27:02] Walters but it was it was some you know highbrow interview so it must have been the 80s by this point um what accounts for your greatness yeah um and he sort of said look um for to have this level he's referring to his own level of drive it must come from a place of heart ship and it it you know he he more much more eloquently than this described that basically everything he has comes from a singular focus of escaping and being better than and improving and he said look the reality of it is kids who don't come for this if your kids don't come from this level of deprivation um they can't be great they can be very well adjusted and that's really the best thing you can hope for them but they can't be great and and I really thought about it a lot I was like that's really there's a lot to reflect on there because first of all there's nothing wrong with being well adjusted it could be a perfectly reasonable goal for kids who come from privilege uh you know kids who have are never to want anything to be perfectly well adjusted but he's arguing that's the best case scenario but great in what great at lifting weights great at being a movie star being exceptional so that's different because you can be a great human being you can have a great like being the elite one % of something has a max amount of has a huge amount of tax on other things absolutely and I don't think look I mean that's the irony I guess of his life is you know he couldn't he couldn't see the crystal ball of the lows that would come with the highs yeah and it's you know to me that's the problem with Hyper successful people they're trying to repeat what they did and ends up being more self-destructive than not and do you are I would argue that most people can't handle greatness because it is addictive or great has reflected by being the best at something or the very best for a period of time and those who are able to accept the fact that none of that matters and it will change and evolve live better lives what do you want for your kid to be the greatest at something for a moment in time and miserable or do you want him to be you know not self- adjusted because that to me is like a consolation price no no but

[01:29:15] I don't I think being well adjusted is is a fantastic uh objective frankly I and and I agree with you completely I I would um which actually by the way kind of is just a very extreme version of the yin and the Yang between uh fluid fluid and crystallized intelligence the more extreme one is the harder you know the more extreme your fluidized inell fluid inell it might be harder to make that transition to crystallize intelligence yeah that's right because and that's true in intelligence but I think that's even more true in um you know what is it like to be Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan yeah that's why I think really really great like 40 perfect students struggle to be super productive in life because they never had to deal with adversity they never had to be coached they've never had to be in a place where they're they're forced to be good at it and you know like it is better to um struggle so that you learn to struggle than to be great at something because life is full of potential struggles well Rick is always awesome to sit down and catch up on life um congratulations on on all of your successes in the in the past couple years in particular and um I'm really excited to hear about this Museum in

[01:30:37] North Carolina I think uh the next time I come out to visit you I hope we can make the time to go and see it because I would actually love to see that no I would love that Peter and you know I I can't say enough to you you've had an incredible impact on my knowledge of you know of of myself and exercise and nutrition and how I'm going to live and you know I my hope I know that the last 10 years of my life I should uh I should name after you because you've done you you've helped me a lot and I love our friendship and I love how we can be so honest with each other and raw and I'm

[01:31:10] I'm humble you would have me especially a second time so great fun thanks Rick [Music]
