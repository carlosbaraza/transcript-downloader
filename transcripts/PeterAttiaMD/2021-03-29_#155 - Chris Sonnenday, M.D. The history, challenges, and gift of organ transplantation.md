## Description

Chris Sonnenday is the Transplant Center Director for Michigan Medicine. As Peter’s senior resident while at Johns Hopkins, Chris made a lasting impression on him with his remarkable leadership and ability to maintain his humanity through the stressors of that challenging environment. In this episode, Chris tells the incredible backstory of the history of transplant medicine, focusing on the kidney and the liver. He discusses the surgical and immunologic developments that launched the field forward, but also lays out the challenges ahead for the field, such as the rising prevalence of chronic kidney and liver failure. Chris also tells many stories of tragedy and triumph that comes with working in organ transplantation, but ultimately explains the rewarding nature of being a witness to the gift of organ donation.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:11] well chris we've been talking about doing this for probably two years now so i'm really happy to finally sit down with you though we had always thought we'd be doing it in person but yes decided just didn't want to wait any longer um uh agreed but uh no i miss you dearly and i think uh during our discussion today people are gonna get to understand why uh you know why you've played such an important role in my development um i guess let's just you know i'll just state for everyone that you were you were one of my senior residents what we call chief residents when i was going through my training at hopkins and um i think on other podcasts people have probably heard me mention you i've certainly talked about you i talked about you on jacob's podcast several years ago i've talked about you on this podcast and uh usually in the context of you know what i consider to be the most remarkable leadership residency was not um not without its stresses and stressors and i think we have lots of great memories from it but but also some not so great ones and and therefore anything that anything that could have been done by those around us to make the process better was always appreciated and uh uh i think we'll get to that later but let's just start by telling folks like how you even got interested in in medicine let alone surgery yeah well first of all thank you so much for the invitation it's uh it's awesome even virtually to to get to hang out with you and reminisce a little bit but also talk about our work and i'm really proud of the work you've done with this podcast it's been so impactful to patients providers it's just a cool way to see your your leadership and impact extend yeah medicine for me was something i stumbled to so i grew up in the dc area i was my dad is a retired presbyterian minister my mom was a medical social worker the only other physician in my family is my grandfather who was an internist and researcher in st louis and you know i went to college without a clear plan other than wanting to to play college soccer which is what uh i was fortunate enough to do and um and i uh had imparted to me by my parents that you know they would support whatever i chose to do but uh wanted it to be something that served other people and um and i you know through the course of my studies you know did uh come to medicine for some of the somewhat cliche reasons you know it was a way it was a really exciting challenging field that appealed to kind of the the problem solver or the scientist in me but first and foremost was a way to serve people and you know was came to surgery very late too in medical school i was one of those people that kind of liked everything and was fascinated by kind of you know all fields but really became attracted to what fortunately i think still sustains me today and that is that um being a surgeon provides this really unique opportunity to enter people's lives in their um scariest kind of darkest moments and to have the privilege to be able to walk that with them and try to help them you know navigate that time and and to have skill in in some cases to solve the problem and i think that was remarkable to me i was you know struck by the the challenge of it and uh you know was fortunate to to make the decision uh to train in surgery and end up at hopkins where as i totally agree with how you described it it was like the one hand kind of forged us into the people we are today but you know also uh was difficult and challenging and and that's partially also what made it you know the experience it was yeah how did how did you pick hopkins um i know everybody who uh i mean i guess you could say hopkins sort of picks people and not the other way around but how did you at least have the desire to go to such a rigorous program um was it something that said hey once i've committed to doing this i might as well go to the best place yeah it was a combination of things you know as as i mentioned i decided a little late in medical school that i wanted to train in general surgery and i and i went and consulted with the program director at my medical school who was john tarpley kind of a legendary general surgeon at vanderbilt and who had spent a lot of his career in africa actually doing doing uh you know mission work and surgery and um you know i i went to meet with him and to be honest with you the goal of that meeting was to have him tell me that i even had a shot at staying at vanderbilt you know that was that was my kind of what i thought would be the the the best i could do and and uh we talked for a long time he's a wonderful person wanted to hear about my goals and um and he said he said i think partially in jess but he said you know what i think we need to send you back to the mothership because he had trained at hopkins and he you know he uh still carried with you know very passionate memories about the training there and the the kind of standard of clinical excellence that that the training programs there represented um and so you know i was fortunate enough to get an interview and and uh was obviously impressed with the history and the the emphasis on clinical excellence but like you uh i think i was also really attracted to the idea of mentorship and one individual in particular keith lilimo who was the program director at the time now the chair of surgery at massachusetts general hospital you know i really got the feeling that he was invested in the development and um uh training of his residents not only as surgeons but also as individuals and as leaders and um and exactly like you said kind of once i got that sense i i wanted to swim in that in that pool so to speak you know figuring that um i would gain as much from obviously the terrific history and mentors and training environment but also uh you know the individuals who we were lucky to train next to you know i mean i think you uh when you feel like you're just running with superstars every day that does push you to be the best possible physician surgeon person you can be and you know i can think of so many individuals just like you that you know inspired me to to push myself to beyond kind of expectations that i probably even had for myself at that period of time yeah i mean it's there's there's no doubt during this discussion chris i'm gonna have to embarrass the hell out of you because you know the reality of it is you were definitely um and you're just gonna be too modest to accept it but you were certainly in a league of your own even amongst that caliber of individuals so you know um you know it's one thing to say you played for the yankees it's another thing to say you were mickey mantle or joe dimaggio um and i think you know to me one of the things i want to dig into today is for many of us certainly myself um i put in that category you know you show up with all of these ideas about what you can be and um what this process is is like and some are along the way a tiny piece of you gets a little broken um you lose a little bit of your humanity you you just your your tolerance for distress goes down the empathy goes down a little bit your tolerance for others around you even on the same team goes down a little bit whether it's your tolerance for an error that a nurse makes your tolerance for an error that the lab makes i mean i just watched in myself over five years a degradation of humanity that in my case led to a very extreme outcome which was departing um i can safely say you're the only person in whom i didn't witness that and simultaneously you were the best of the best so it it's it's to me that's just an unusual combination that i i definitely want to understand that a bit more well i mean that's very kind of you i didn't feel that way at the time which is i guess true of all of us you don't uh the the battle you're waging within is you know different than what everybody sees on the outside um you know i mean i think um you know one way of asking that question is kind of what sustained me during that time period what you know kept all of us going but but me in particular you know i i definitely had a um you know overwhelming sense from day one of arriving in baltimore and this speaks to kind of my medical training in general but certainly specifically our residency that i felt like um you know i was very lucky to be there you know that there were there were hundreds of qualified individuals who could have taken that spot and and other and probably thousands of other individuals who who didn't get the opportunities i did to get to that spot um and so i felt uh you know obligated if that's the right word to kind of maximize that entire experience you know i also um felt the the burden if you will of of the expectations of those around me you know i mean the the um uh the expectations of those that were training us our colleagues et cetera you know i always i one of the things i said to to dr lillone dr cameron when i left was you know thank you for your high expectations like that's really what drove me to achieve uh things that i didn't necessarily think were within me i will say though that the last thing and this this is true to this day so it's not specific to residency is that i have always found fortunately that um what recenters me when medicine gets hard because it does get difficult whether you practice in a you know busy primary care practice where you're cramming through 40 patients a day or you're doing operations where a wrong move leads can lead to somebody's death you know there are there are good days and bad days and there are pressures that can do all the things to you that you alluded to but what has always re-centered me is the patience i mean to be honest that um that privilege that i was speaking of earlier of being invited into people's lives in these crazy moments and actually having the opportunity to intervene and somehow even in the thick of residency when you're like how can you know why is it that this lab i ordered 14 hours ago has still hasn't been done or you know why can't i find the x-rays that were just on this desk like two hours ago uh you know or what are all the other crazy things that we had to deal with or why why is there no food to eat at 11 o'clock at a 24 7 operation um you know the thing that always kind of re-centered me is reminding me that you know the people upstairs uh in those beds headed a lot worse off than i did and you know i think that that the privilege of being involved in their care is kind of what re-centered me and still does today you know when i have days like that i that is always what is able to kind of pull me back to the right frame of mind another thing that i think made you very special um that wasn't that i think was actually distinct from everything you're describing everything you're describing was on incredible visible display but you could have i think had all of those characteristics and you wouldn't have created the magnet that someone like me felt now i can't speak for the other residents but i i just i know i it would be um hard for me to imagine i'm the only one that felt this way but i just remember any time my rotation card showed i was going to be your junior resident it didn't matter what the rotation was i couldn't wait for that month to arrive and um so that speaks to something a little different and i mean like let's go back to you went to northwestern if i recall right for college and so you're a division one athlete you're playing soccer were you the team leader um i was a captain um you know i think uh um i was not the best player on the team at least on my college teams for sure but um i do feel very lucky that i was um you know elected to represent the team and to serve in you know a leadership role at least as it as it is within the context of an athletic uh team you know i do think that um one of the things that has always been true for me you know and this dates back to you know sports as a kid and you know and to be honest is part of the reason why i chose to be a transplant surgeon is that i always migrated to team you know collaborative uh activities um you know i was i was never an individual sport athlete you know i i swam a bit i played tennis a bit but i never kind of like was captivated by those sports uh in the same way that i was of just being on a team and in fact you know both there were multiple times in my development as a young kid playing soccer in the dc area which is a very competitive kind of soccer environment um you know where i was lucky to kind of be on the some of the teams that i was on playing with you know elite players um but being on that team being in that environment you know seemed to pull the best out of me and um and i think that was true in residency too you know what what i relished the most was like you know yeah it was five in the morning but you showed up and there was peter and there was megan and there you know it was your team and it was like you know this like you felt like you were you know unstoppable to some degree even though you were you know doing what at times seemed a possible task and and i feel the same way about transplant you know i feel like the part of the reason i chose it it was clear that no one can accomplish what it takes to take a liver transplant patient from you know from their diagnosis to listing to to operation to recovery to you know transforming transforming them to a new life afterwards without you know a really highly functioning team and that that is what always has kind of inspired me to um you know give my best because i feel like i'm in a team where other people are doing the same thing i mean there's a story i'll tell that i would imagine you don't recall because it was so commonplace but it it really stood out to me as an example of what like a a great leader would do so you'll have to you'll have to forgive me for explaining a process that you understand oh too well but most people don't which is um actually i'm going to have you explain it tell folks what the m m conference was every tuesday morning yeah so so you're referring to what what at hopkins was called morbidity and mortality conference which is a um you know i think there are versions of that throughout medicine but in in surgery it is a unique part of the culture so um i think one of the things that makes surgeons and surgery unique as a discipline is the sense of ownership accountability responsibility for the the outcomes of the patients that you're privileged to care for and so uh morbidity and mortality conference was a weekly conference where we reviewed essentially patients stories patients cases particularly patients that had sub-optimal outcomes whether it was a complication as as hopefully routine as a wound complication or something that they would would extend their recovery but they would recover from fully to a to a death related to a surgical procedure or or at least to a diagnosis that we tried to uh address with the surgical procedure and i think you know every my former chair here at michigan mike mulholland used to say that you know you can look into this into a department soul by attending their you know morbidity and mortality conference it it is it becomes the kind of cultural event of the department because you get a sense for what that level is of accountability is is the conference spent kind of blaming the anesthesiologist or the nurse or you know uh or the patient's comorbid conditions or is the is the discussion about what we could do better next time um to make the patient's outcome better and i think you know there are uh lots of examples that you know i'm sure you and i could regale for for hours of kind of how lessons learned in that room you know in the morning um you know shape the way we think about medicine the way we think about responsibility you know all kinds of other things one thing i always admired is that the chair who was there for most of the time we were there john cameron he would often be the the moderator of morbidity mortality conference and he always led as you recall with his own cases which is you know a remarkable example of the level of accountability that i think he was trying to to encourage among the the faculty and residents there yeah that's one of the things that stood out to me because i went to medical school at stanford and it was just a different culture it wasn't nearly as rigorous and so even in medical school you would still attend that during your surgical rotations but it it it was not the conference that i saw at hopkins which was i mean this was the most intense hour of the week and it was taking place outside of the operating room so this this was kind of the story that that i'll that i'll tell that kind of always it just remains to this day etched in my mind so um you and i this is by this point you're now the trauma fellow so you have now finished residency you are now staying at hopkins for another year to do what can only be described as the craziest fellowship ever it's a hepatobiliary oncology fellowship combined with trauma every third night as if that weren't enough and it's either july or august so it's very early in the academic year i'm the third year resident so i'm kind of your most senior resident on that service and um you're the acs and you so you're functioning like the attending and we had just come on that morning to receive sign off from the team that was leaving and you know we both recall just how chaotic that could be right you know you've got people that are just getting shot two hours earlier you gotta run to the or with them and you're being told about these all this patient this patient this patient and i mean almost as a matter of fact one of those patients was being discharged that day and it was sort of like this person on this floor is going to go home in a couple of hours nobody needs to go and even see that person you not only went and saw that person but realized something was wrong and it pains me i don't remember what was wrong but either you sense that this person had a compartment syndrome that got missed i think they'd been hit by a car that that day before or something like that you sensed something that was missed you for you to be the one to go and catch it was out of this world right never would the attending go and be the one to go and check on the patient whose discharge paperwork is already signed to go home but you did that you caught the misdiagnosis took the patient to the operating room operated you know probably saved his leg you then presented that case at m m several weeks later but the part that blew my mind was you never mentioned the circumstances around which this patient came into our care in other words there was no blaming there was no yeah well you know mr smith was about to be discharged but i decided to go and make sure he was okay and realized actually he had a compartment syndrome and needed surgery to save his leg instead it was you presented it as though it was your fault as though you had missed it and i i i honestly it sounds crazy that was one of the moments when i realized i don't i'm not good enough to be in this profession you know uh maybe none of us are but but i don't know if you remember that case but uh yeah i do actually now that you recall it and it was the circumstances were as you described it was one of those crazy days where 35 things are happening and you know we we were all over 34 of them unfortunately the 35th was this poor guy who was you know getting ready to be wheeled out of the hospital and yeah i mean i think you know i don't remember the circumstances of the m m discussion but i but i do certainly um carry the you know philosophy in my work currently and you know certainly that um you know there is not value in kind of assigning blame to individuals there's only um value in recognizing opportunity for us as a system as a team to get better and and partially it's because you know i think you know if if i were to throw stones in that case you know i could walk out of that conference in an hour later be the one responsible for kind of generating you know a similar or worse complication so i think there's some humility that has to enter into understanding that no one has all the answers uh nor should be expected to kind of catch everything in fact one of the things that i think has one of the as you know one of the criticisms of the eminent morbidity mortality culture is that at least historically it had been a little bit too much about assigning individual blame and not about recognizing opportunity for change but i do think that that over time i've seen that change and certainly the way morbidity and mortality conferences are run now for example at my institution and others that i've visited are much more focused on what's right for the patient than rather you know who can we who's you know uh who do we have to kind of string up for you know this particular mistake which is which is number one better for patients number two sets a better example for the for the trainees and learners in the room that are that are uh trying to do this and just as a is an important piece of creating the right culture where everybody's kind of ores are moving in the same direction at what point during residency did you decide that it was going to be transplant medicine versus the other things that you had clearly shown you know a fantastic predilection for such as pancreatic surgery liver surgery and and all facets of surgical oncology and the gi tract yeah i mean honestly i was i was greedy i kind of wanted to do do it all you know i i when i entered hopkins i had um developed an interest in cut in diseases of the hepatibiliary system and upper gi tract so that was another thing that clearly drove my my interest in that residency where they had such expertise uh and and uh kind of a you know concentration of experts in those diseases it was um you know i i did my um intern year rotation and transplant and then again a third year rotation in transplant my uh fellow as an intern and then my junior attending as a third year was one of the people whose men you know one of the most important influences on my professional career uh who's bob montgomery now the head of transplantation at nyu and a you know in a transformative figure in our field uh over the last couple decades and you know partially it was his example of you know what i thought i could aspire to be as a transplant surgeon partially it was realizing that the distance from kind of bench to bedside and transplantation is really short you know it was unlike anything that i had had seen even in in a very innovative progressive you know surgical department and finally you know specifically speaking to my previous interest i did see liver transplantation specifically as being completely complementary to um to being a comprehensive about a biliary surgeon and and physician for patients with you know hepatobiliare disease you know it's interesting in other parts of the world it's pretty commonplace for a patability surgeons and liver transplant surgeons to be the same individuals you know in the u.s just with training tracks changing over time and such there are there tend to be surgical oncologists who do a badability surgery and transplant surgeons who may do some avatability surgery but i clearly thought it would make me a more complete surgeon and physician to to train in both and and i've been very lucky i mean this isn't something that can happen necessarily at every institution but i've i've straddled that line in my career too about half my clinical practices is uh hepatobiliary surgery surgery of the liver bile duct and pancreas for mostly for cancer but other benign diseases and then liver transplantation so you know i feel like i won the lottery you know kind of walking that line you know to be able to combine those disciplines um tell folks a little bit about what you mean by bench to bedside and that that distance being short it's a term we throw around a lot in medicine but its significance is huge i want to make sure people understand it yeah no it's it's a great point i mean i mean part of it is just understanding the history right so you know transplantation as a field is very young you know so the first kidney transplants were done in the 1950s the first liver heart and lung transplants attempted in the 1960s none of which were particularly successful until the 1980s related to all sorts of important changes but particularly the development of effective immunosuppression and then all of once it became a a feasible and successful medical intervention then developing all of the systems around uh making that a reality for more people and extending that to people with organ failure of various causes so so here we are you know surgical residents in the 1990s in a field that really is about 10 years old in terms of kind of being operationally uh you know expanding enough to to really be a reality at most major medical you know major medical centers and so you know you would see you would see things being discussed kind of in morning reporter rounds or like you know now this is a really uh tricky case of acute rejection we haven't tried x yet and then you would see we try x and you know it would work or not work and we just or there were surgical techniques you know living donor liver transplantation basically part of a major part of my practice now was created in the you know 1990s and early 2000s so so i think the ability to see innovation become reality in very um you know uh rapid form was was number one inspiring i mean you felt like you were doing something that was that was new and innovative and just really incredible but also um you know i think to be honest it made you feel like you could potentially have some impact in the development of a field that was nascent and you know i would put myself in maybe the second or third generation of transplanters you know in terms of its history which is which is a very you know i feel very fortunate to be kind of a witness to that history and participate in some of it um moving forward let's use kidney as an example to explain to people kind of the challenges today you know we take kidney transplants almost for granted because the success rate is so high in fact even when i was a resident um you know if if if if you demonstrated that you had enough of this skill and the interest you know even the transplant fellow would let you as the you know mid-level resident or the senior resident general surgery do kidney transplants you mentioned bob montgomery there was a stretch on transplant where bob and i did 13 consecutive kidney transplants together in a period of like four days so the fact that you know kind of a knuckle dragger like me could have been doing this speaks to how well it works today but as you said this is a procedure that even in the 1960s kerry carried with it a mortality of you know more than 50 percent so let's break down for people the evolution of this uh from sort of the technical evolution right there was it was only what maybe a little over a hundred years ago that the anastomosis was even understood um to then the complications of acute rejection chronic rejection and even understanding what the immune system is is doing so and then we're going to get to liver after because of course liver takes it to a whole new level in all regards well i think you know kidney transplantation is kind of the the best example of all the the challenges that you just alluded to it was also um the the first solid organ at least that that um appealed to you know the earliest pioneers in the field is something that you know it seemed feasible to give someone an extra kidney like that you could kind of imagine a way technically to make that work as opposed to doing you know what we now do for say heart or liver transplantation where you're doing an orthotopic transplant you're literally taking out the prior organ and putting in the new one that's a little different than a heterotopic kidney transplant where you're giving them an extra organ and hoping that replaces the function yeah we should people probably don't understand that but when we do kidney transplants we don't go into the retroperitoneum take out the old kidneys we're putting the new kidney basically in their pelvis attaching it to the blood vessels in the pelvis and taking the little tube that drains urine and just putting that into the bladder the ureter and the bladder and obviously that's much easier than if you were gonna remove the old kidneys and put the new kidney in their place given the location of the kidneys um yeah agreed yeah i mean i think it it it really was to make kidney transplantation feasible was a collision of you know lots of hard work by multiple individuals some of whom thinking about what you just said literally what are the technical details of taking an organ out of a either living or deceased donor mitigating the injury that goes from cutting off its blood supply until you're able to restore it into the into the recipient's body so there's a whole concept of kind of the the technique the preservation uh and then the implantation and then parallel to that was this whole question of well how do we handle the immunologic consequences of that and so the the series of events that occurred and allowed kidney transplantation to be a reality were really that the the kind of technical and preservation elements came to fruition before we figured out the immunologic elements and in fact the first kidney transplant as you know performed in 1954 at brigham and women's hospital by joseph murray who eventually won the nobel prize was in identical twins right so he had a two brothers one brother who had kidney failure another brother who was healthy took one of the healthy brothers kidneys and and transplanted it into into the sick brother and um you know that proof of principle um was what created even kind of the possibility the vision that transplantation could work because we understood the technical uh and preservation challenges of actually taking an organ out of one person's body and putting into someone else murray was a plastic surgeon wasn't he yeah joseph was a plastic surgeon and interestingly although he and his colleagues figured out this technical piece what attracted him to transplant was the concept of tissue transfer and the immunology of that so so a lot of the early work in immunology was done with skin grafts and kind of understanding why you could take a skin graft from your own body and put it somewhere and it would live but if you took a skin graft from someone else's body and put it on a on a site it would not it would generally not live and so so there was this whole kind of cadre of of clinician scientists who were interested in that question including interestingly plastic surgeons like joseph murray so so he became involved in that with a group of other surgeons including some folks who had vascular expertise and others and kind of conceived and developed in preclinical models and animals this you know idea of putting a kidney in the pelvis and attaching it to the blood vessels and platter and then pulled it off in a in a human and a lot of if you look at the history of kidney transplantation through the 1950s and into the 1960s most of the kidney transplants performed were between twins which you know there's a limited supply of available organs there so you could see right there that that was going to be a capacity problem but you know for the for example the first kidney transplant at the university of michigan was performed in 1963 between two twin sisters who uh a few years ago we were celebrating our 5 000th transplanted organ at the university of michigan and those two sisters came back you know to celebrate that event so i mean it it was a remarkably uh it was a remarkable achievement but it was a little bit uh of a false pretense because none of the immunologic barriers were being confronted and and really what happened over the next four decades were the development of effective immunosuppression to make that a reality and as you alluded to it's pretty remarkable to think that you know in the 1960s and 70s and into the early 80s kidney transplants were being done and there were um success stories there we you know the field worked out how to understand who had preformed antibodies to particular donors so you could avoid those and pick kind of pairs that might be more successful there were increasingly sophisticated immunosuppression strategies that that did work you know and drugs that were available like uh like steroids and azathioprine you know were were making transplantation a possibility but it's pretty remarkable to think in comparison to what we expect now that in the 1960s and 70s if you look at some of the published series there were mortality rates mortality rates meaning the patient died after kidney transplantation of 50 60 even 70 percent so it's not only that they lost their graft but the consequences of the operation the immunosuppression subsequent usually infections you know was was uh making these procedures highly morbid and and unsuccessful at least at rates that we would think of as acceptable now and what was the life expectancy if you opted for dialysis in the 1960s how long could you be expected to survive it's a great question and you know the the first and most important kind of answer to that question is the assumption that you could get dialysis you know so dialysis was not available everywhere it was largely centered around hospitals that had the ability to provide that service you know dialysis care was was not um routinely covered by insurers in fact it wasn't until kind of a quirky rider to the uh to the act to the law that created medicare in in the 1960s that that patients with dialysis even had the option the ability to get health insurance so um so the it was it was hard to get dialysis and then the survival on dialysis due to the challenges of uh infection from repeated you know access the hemodynamic consequences and cardiovascular consequences we know of of what were then you know more crude primitive dialysis machines was such that the life expectancy was probably measured in months to years you know so two to four years might be a you know very successful outcome for someone on dialysis you know the average life expectancy if you take all comers for an individual on dialysis now is is about 10 years or so but again that is partially affected by the fact that dialysis is more freely available you know people elderly individuals and people with other comorbid disease have access to dialysis they wouldn't have had um so it was there were no good solutions you know for patients with with organ failure in those in those times so i want to make sure people really get a sense of what these immune based challenges were we take it all for granted today because we can rattle off all mhc2 mhc-1 complexes and that stuff's been worked out in the most elegant manner but in the 1960s that was not the case maybe start by explaining incompatibility because i think that's something people understand if you uh if you came in the hospital and you'd lost blood and we wanted to give you a blood transfusion we couldn't just willy-nilly give you anybody's blood we'd have to make sure that the blood type matched uh that's not entirely true if you had you know we could give you o-negative blood no matter what but walk people through kind of which would be this in my mind at least the simplest form of antibody mediated rejection and then let's use that as a way to explain what was actually happening to all those non-twin transplants yeah so that's a great model to start with so if you think about it in really basic forms you know our immune system has evolved to recognize self recognize our own tissues and is has been primed to recognize things that that do not look like like us mostly to be able to fight off viruses and you know other environmental challenges but that unfortunately makes it difficult for for something like transplantation so in the case of a blood compatibility we we carry a blood of us of a particular type it has to do with the the uh kind of the protein signature on the coating of those red blood cells and they we know that if you give someone who uh carries blood of a certain type a blood type that is incompatible so let's make it the simplest someone who has blood type a and someone who has blood type b and you give the individual with blood type a blood from an individual with blood type b the they will uh have antibodies that attack those blood cells and essentially destroy the blood cells because they think they are recognized as foreign it's more complex than that because there's also these things called the the rh antigens which are kind of what make blood positive and negative and you're correct that uh blood type o um you know individuals who do not have blood typo do you do not have preformed antibodies to to those uh to that donor pool so that that is kind of the universal uh donor uh pool but it was figuring out um that incompatibility um understanding that was kind of the first step in understanding how you would potentially take an organ out of one individual and place it into another because you know and and this is still true to this day that kind of step one in matching a donor and recipient is knowing their blood type because that's kind of the the first step um it gets more complicated than that for all the reasons you alluded to because it turns out those are not the only proteins on the surfaces of those cells that are recognized by our immune system and and this in particular this group of protein called human leukocyte antigens which is what you were alluding to um or hla types is what kind of in a very crude way determines one individual from another that profile and so the history of this is pretty interesting going back to my skin graft analogy so so what what investigators around the turn of the century were figuring out is again so you could take a skin graft from elsewhere in your body and it was it would tend to work if you took a skin graft from somewhere somewhere else from another individual it did not work then even more interestingly if you took a second skin graft from that same individual and put it on it died faster it's as if the body was primed to to destroy that new skin graft kind of sounds like a vaccine huh yeah exactly so it was kind of the second exactly it's the same principle so this is kind of the second hit hypothesis that the body the immune system learned to recognize this foreign tissue and and the immune system was even more effective in eliminating it and it was that whole series of experiments that led to this um these concepts right in the middle of the of the last century where the question was and this was debated by individuals much smarter than us many of whom now have no nobel prizes after their name but you know so was there something circulating in the donor in sorry and in the recipients serum that found the this tissue antibodies uh was the was the theory attacked this tissue set off the immune cascade destroyed the tissue or was it more complicated than that was there kind of like we've learned about in um embryology from thymic development was there some sort of priming event that had to take place where the the body presented this foreign tissue to the immune system and then the immune system learned how to to uh recognize it as itself or foreign and destroy it right so so just to separate that right the in the case of blood incompatibility it was pretty easy to figure out that it was just these soluble circulating antibodies they weren't quote unquote smart they were just floating around and you could do it in a test tube that's right literally that's right so you have a blood type a with its little a antigen and if the recipient has an anti a it grabs on to it and these things precipitate out a solution of this reaction and of course now the question that you're posing is is that how it works on organs or is there something more complicated where there's another actor correct and and the reason that that was such a kind of fundamental question because if you believed it was like the blood analogy and that okay so if we could identify the patients that had pre-formed antibodies preformed proteins in their serum that were going to ruin this opportunity then well that's great then we can select out the patients that have that reaction and use the organ to transplant others so that's the concept of what is now called and transplant a cross match so the idea of taking donor cells recipient serum mixing them in an assay and determining whether or not the that serum lyses those cells and that is more or less the technique that is used to cross match uh individuals to to to match you know as you'll hear people talk about oh i want to donate a kidney to my uncle or something i wonder if i'm a match that's to some degree what they're talking about is whether or not that uh assay says that they have um that their uncle in this case doesn't have pre-formed antibodies that are going to destroy their cells so that would explain kind of that initial screening step but what was conf and and the other thing that that helped explain is why sometimes when you would do a transplant either in animals or eventually in humans there were there was this phenomenon which came to be known as hyper acute rejection where you would put the organ in you would take the clamps off the organ would fill with blood you looks like you've you know won the game and then it would immediately start to thrombose and die essentially that process called hyperacute rejection was figured out was because of the circulating antibodies to those hla engines of the donor so that made some sense we can try to figure that out what didn't make sense is you would do the transplant you would get past that hyperacute stage the organs working and then a day later three days later six months later the organ would fail from acute rejection um so basically the same process but with a different kind of lead time and it was after much debate in the field the nuances of which you know are are are more sophisticated than i can explain but it was figured out that what was actually happening was not this circulating what we came to call antibody mediated or humeral rejection but actually was happening on a cellular level so so-called cellular rejection and as we learned eventually over time that had to do with kind of what we now learn in basic immunology antigen presenting cell with carrying an antigen from the the foreign tissue in this case the donor tissue immune immune mediator cells and we've discovered and learned eventually they were t cells that recognition priming the immune system to form injury either you know by various means cytokines eventual antibody formation etc and that was what was destroying organs in that kind of subacute phase and as we figured out over the course of decades the the drugs that we had to blunt that initial immune response high-dose steroids i i refer days of thiaprin they tried total body irradiation at some of the early you know that was frannie that was doing that exactly right in the brigham those weren't effective in preventing that cellular level rejection and and it was only later you know really the 1980s that we we developed immunosuppressive agents that were selective enough to interfere with that cellular reaction and it was it was then that transplant really became a reality because now you had the ability to sustain an organ beyond just weeks to months and you you know looking at more long-term survival so really the turning points are two-fold right one it's the knowledge of what's happening because certainly by the 80s it was not a technical challenge to be able to remove a kidney transport a kidney and put it in by the way was wisconsin's solution already around by the 80s or did that come later yeah yeah so the or at least the predecessors of wisconsin solution and and the other tell folks what that is and why that matters so much as well yeah so so the the theory is you know you take an organ out of the uh out of the donor body whether deceased or living you flush the blood cells and such out of it so that it doesn't clot you then store it on ice and you know transport it to the recipient and and put it in and there were all kinds of initial thoughts about well do you just put it in saline essentially and transport it to the other room and then and what they found was that and this was you know experimentation that happened over decades was that the there was um there were cellular processes occurring both as kind of at the time from when ischemia begins when the you know vessels are clamped and the organ is coming out and before blood flow and oxygen is restored to the organ there were cellular processes occurring that could be mitigated by creating preservation solutions essentially saline that was fortified with particular molecules and and you know the history of all this is beyond me but literally they tried you know it's like making gatorade they tried you know different electrolyte solutions and additives and and uh other nutrients until they figured out which mitigated that that ischemic time uh the best and that the crazy thing to think about and this gets to alludes to something maybe we could talk about later in terms of you know where is preservation going in the future but the crazy thing is we're pretty much more or less doing that now you know so some of the fluid solutions and some of the you know minor details of what additives are in the fluid has changed but that's essentially the way we've been preserving organs since the 1960s 70s you know which is pretty remarkable that that was that was one as you said one of the early barriers figured out in the field so once this notion of the hla system is understood and we understand these different types of compatibilities a drug is discovered and it's um you know my favorite drug on the planet happens to come from basically a fungus this is another drug that came from a fungus but a different one the drug is called cyclosporine and i think you could make the case um but i'd like to hear your take on it because you know this field so much better than i do but but if i were telling the story i would say that was the turning point was the advent of cyclosporine do you agree with that or do you do you think that i'm overstating that no 100 percent um you know so so as as you said and similar to the stories of drug development that happen in other circumstances you know this was a a recognized compound that you know had been experimented in a number of different lines of investigation and an investigator who's really one of the central figures in the history of transplant named sir i calm in cambridge performed a series of pre-clinical experiment experiments that that showed that using this medication prevented rejection in in transplant models and what eventually was discovered is that it was interfering with the cascade that occurred when that foreign antigen was presented to the recipient t cell and [Music] in other words it was a more selective immunosuppressant so directly interfering with the cascade of events that happens downstream of the t cell receptors and it specifically inhibited il2 secretion it it affects il2 secretion um but there you know there's actually some interesting uh debate about how the calcineurine inhibitors so cyclosporine and then its eventual cousin tachyclimus um works you know they both uh function at the level of what are called immunophyllons these you know soluble uh intracellular components and and although they affect both kind of the activation of cytokines after that t cell recognition including il-2 they also seem to have other effects on the affinity of the binding of the t-cell receptor they have they have systemic effects that are kind of interesting like for example tacrolimus the other medication i mentioned you know has a potent vaso constrictor effect in certain organs so so we probably don't fully understand its impact but certainly the the the central uh component of its mechanism was interfering with the cascade that occurs after t cell receptor binding and you're and you're absolutely right like it literally was a game changer overnight so you know if you look at papers written in the 1980s about kidney transplant outcomes there's literally an inflection point you went from recipients having one year graft survival rates even with kind of the best immunosuppressive regimens that had been figured out at that point one-year graph survival rates probably in the 70-ish 60 percent range boom you know 90 overnight just with the addition of cyclosporine and then you know eventually refining kind of some some of the multi-drug regimens so it was a complete game changer it not only revolutionized the the impact of kidney transplantation which from a public health standpoint is clearly the most impactful organ we transplant you know the the number of patients with end-stage renal disease the number of patients the crown of kidney disease you know from a public health standpoint kidney transplantation is just a fundamental uh important medical therapy but so not only did it make that a reality and make it a preferred alternative to dialysis it also reinvigorated the other solid organ transplant other solid organ transplants as being a reality so you know liver transplantation which is essentially had been on a more or less enforced hiatus through the 60s and 70s heart transplantation similarly lung transplantation as well the the confidence that now that we understood some of the technical and kind of patient related factors that dictated the success of the operation to now also have the promise that those organs would last more than you know 90 days you know reinvigorated those fields completely and you know again you know almost overnight over the course of years you started to see liver transplant programs heart transplant programs lung transplant programs pop up at major medical centers all throughout the country in the 1980s and into the early 1990s so that was really the revolution that occurred because of that drug development when we look at the the the demand for kidney uh transplantation today what percentage of it is chronic versus acute kidney failure yeah so the vast majority is chronic so there are um occasions where patients can get acute renal injury from you know traumatic events uh other medical catastrophes or they get acute kidney injury in the chronic in this case of sepsis or something that they otherwise recover from and that that does um you know we still see and we still see occasionally patients who get for example post streptococcal glomerulonephritis or other diseases that are more linked to kind of an acute event the vast majority of kidney transplants now in the united states the the primary indication is diabetes or hypertension so this is chronic kidney disease as a consequence of those comorbid conditions which is one of the reasons again from a public health standpoint the the impact of kidney transplantation is massive you know so you have a hundred thousand people roughly waiting for a kidney transplant in the united states you probably have four fold that or thereabout on dialysis and then probably tenfold that number with chronic kidney disease so the the potential impact of of having an effective and durable therapy for chronic kidney disease is is remarkable um and i think it's it's really important to consider as a as a you know public health problem yeah i i can't agree with you more chris and about three years ago i sort of had this obvious epiphany i say obvious because i'm sort of thinking why did it take me so long to do the math but i realized if if my interest clinically is trying to figure out how to help people live longer and live better you've got to start thinking about what are the things that you have to plan for so if you're flying a glider where you know you want to cross a 200 foot chasm but now all of a sudden you say well i want that chasm to be 300 feet you have to start thinking about how much higher does that glier glider need to fly and one of the things that really occurred to me was kidney function we sort of have in the back of our minds ah you know look if the person reaches the finish line of life and their glomerular filtration rate is 40 great you know they don't need dialysis they're doing just fine and if we think that an average life expectancy should be 71 or something and we think that hey we're going to tolerate a person's gfr being in the low 40s when they're in their early 70s that's great but if we're trying to figure out a way to help people live and live well into their 90s or beyond that's that becomes a very unacceptable gfr you're going to run into trouble and so you know looking at statin c beyond just creatinine and other biomarkers and looking at microalbumin in the urine twice a year i mean we do all these things but even though they seem kind of crazy because it's how you sort of start to catch that early early oh look you know what your blood pressure of 130 over 85 is not really acceptable that's that's that's going to take you from a gfr of 95 to 85 in the next decade and we consider that to be too precipitous a decline so unfortunately my view is that i think the demand for kidneys is only going to go up as we see the rampant explosion of pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome yeah i totally agree with you i think and there's so many kind of wrinkles to that question to think about i mean the first is that is the obvious statement that as you preach better than anybody we don't do preventative care you know in in this country very well and and we particularly don't do it for things where we don't have reliable measures you know so so to your point you know we we use serum creatinine as kind of our best guess at kidney function there's lots of reasons why that's a poor indicator you know it's it's not it's very dependent on muscle mass and and other variables that that um allow you that prevent you from using some sort of kind of normalized number as an acceptable range there are more sensitive markers as you alluded to there there's now that i think fortunately finally being recognized the whole question of how creatinine and gfr and race interacts and how that needs to be accommodated for so so you're right so number one we don't measure it well so therefore we don't appreciate the size of the problem number two is we again this is kind of a situation where transplant is a victim of its own success you know as transplantation has gotten more successful transplant centers around the country transplant providers and and just the medical community in general has started to say well you know why don't we provide kidney transplants for 70 year olds if there are otherwise you know healthy individuals because their life expectancy might be 20 years from that point so um and that's that i think the the collision of that and then the what you alluded to this pre-diabetes metabolic syndrome you know progressive kidney dysfunction in an aging population is going to create an enormous demand for kidney transplantation you know we we uh transplanted an 81 year old a few weeks ago and i remember as i was looking at the the uh census i i don't do kidney transplant very commonly as part of my clinical practice i was looking at a census i was like wait a minute is that is is this gentleman 10 years out from a transplant back in the hospital for some other reason or did we actually transplant this 81 year old but the point is there are individuals who are healthy functional people otherwise who have whose life you know part of what we're talking about is survival benefit right you compare their survival on dialysis to their survival with the transplant transplant is going to win almost every time um you know as long as they you know can tolerate the operation of the immune suppression so so it isn't it isn't it kind of remarkable to think of the scope of that problem and particularly to take a longevity lens on it you know it's it's really kind of an interesting challenge to think about for the next you know 20 30 years of transplantation so before we get on to liver which is is is such an amazing story as well i want to i want to wrap a few things up on on kidney so let's let's talk about the evolution from cyclosporin to to prograph or tacrolimus as you discussed um and where we are today on some of the most common immunosuppressive regimens and then i also want to touch on this idea of not just living donors but the live donor swaps and stuff because i'll tell you one of the things that i'll never forget from my intern rotation on transplant which like you captivated me beyond words i mean sim transplant was never even something on my radar before residency um and for the entire time i was in residency it was always one of those things was like i could see myself doing this this is so cool and it was actually i think it was bob montgomery as well that shared this with me which was a live donor zero out of six hla match is always going to be a six out of six cataveric match and i remember thinking how is that possible now tell folks what i just said what explain what i just said to people and and more importantly explain why it's true yeah so it's uh um it's pretty remarkable to consider the impact of living donation and and the um to your earlier question kind of figuring out the appropriate place for living donation as transplantation moves forward so in kidney transplantation and counter distinction to liver transplantation but in kidney transplantation living donation has been part of kidney transplantation from its origins you know so as i alluded to already the first transplant done between identical twins living donation remained a part of the development of kidney transplantation and then really took off in the 1990s we witnessed it happening with the development of the laparoscopic donor nephrectomy operation um a procedure pioneered by two individuals at hopkins lou cavusi and lloyd ratner who and that you know having a procedure that was of such tremendous benefit to the recipient that then was safe and you know a smoother recovery for the donor you know really allowed that to explode and if you look at kidney transplantation in the united states now you know so let's say 18 to 20 000 patients a year undergo kidney transplant united states and it's actually about half and half living donors and deceased donors um and and that's probably with under realizing the potential of living donation for all the reasons you said so part of what you're alluding to is if you kind of compare head to head let's say you have a patient on dialysis a patient who receives a deceased donor kidney transplant and a patient who receives a living donor kidney transplant you know let's say the starting line is the same for all three of those and let's say that they're similar age similar comorbid conditions similarly a suppressive regimen for the transplant recipients so the the benefits are pretty clear the dialysis curve is going to drop off pretty quickly so the in fact the studies that have shown that where the dialysis and transplant curves cross even with the risks of undergoing a surgical procedure and starting immunosuppression occurs in less than a year it's probably in somewhere between 90 and 250 days depending on patient characteristics so so that's clear dialysis loses what's interesting then is that there's a difference between the deceased and living donor curves and that's what you were kind of so fascinated about and the reasons for that are many but it probably speaks to the fact that even with all of the best technique and advances there is really no way to mitigate the fact that a deceased donor that goes through the process and the trauma of brain death or donation after cardiac death gets removed from that individual's body preserved put on ice transported to another center and then sewn into the recipient and that interval of time can be six to 48 72 hours in some circumstances as opposed to a living donor elective operation side by side or sequential operating rooms you know the the uh that kidney is in a healthy environment with a healthy normal person normal vital signs we dissect out the kidney clamp the blood vessels take it out of the body flush it walk it over to the recipient's room and sometimes it's sewn in in under an hour you know so the time the ischemic time from coming out of the donor's body to into the recipient and it turns out that ischemic period is critical and is really almost linearly related to the graft survival part of that is probably due to the the consequences just of the ischemia reperfusion injury and kind of literally knocking off some nephrons just from that process part of it also is as we've learned is that that ischemia reprofusion injury cascade that starts is a priming event for the immune system so not only do deceased donor kidneys kind of pound for pound compared to living donor kidneys take that initial hit from the ischemia perfusion injury they're also more prone to rejection you see a more immunologic injury they they they're you know depends on the circumstance they often require more immune suppression you know greater frequency of rejection so it really is almost like two different products from a recipient's point of view and so you know i think if you had your druthers you know as a person in need of a kidney transplant you would um want to have the access and the opportunity to get a living donor any day of the week if you if that is possible to you and this other point though is to narrow that gap between the two it's that with the with the deceased donor you at least try to maximize the immuno compatibility and with the living donor you have much more flexibility correct that's exactly right so you know what you were describing is kind of uh the situation that you the story you alluded to with bob as you're comparing a a living donor kidney so optimal conditions of the transplant but not a perfect immunologic situation at least from looking in hla alone versus a deceased donor kidney that immunologically is a home run that's about as good a situation as you can get but still takes that ischemic hit and and we can't make up for that so even the best immunologic situation can't mitigate that which i think is a realization that doesn't always kind of come to fruition but is again one of the reasons why we feel comfortable really pushing every kidney transplant candidate to to think very seriously about exploring options for a living donation it's also what's led to some of the things you alluded to you know paired kidney exchanges and other things to try and expand the the compatibility of donors and recipients let's let's use an example to to explain that to people because it's really quite fascinating and and we trained very close to some of the people who really did a lot of the work behind optimizing the mathematical algorithms around that so um let's pretend that um you know you called me tomorrow and said peter you're not gonna believe this but you know i'm kind of at the end of my rope with my kidneys uh and i'm gonna you know i'm gonna need to have a transplant and and i you know i i was sad i thought about it and i decided you know what i there's there's no greater way that i want to be able to thank chris for all he's done for me than to give him a kidney and i've got two and i'm perfectly healthy and i'm willing to part with one of them so i call you up and i say chris i want to give you one of my kidneys i want to be a living donor to you so we would go and meet with the transplant team and they would do some tests and what if they discovered that i was a lousy match for you we didn't even have the same blood type never mind hla compatibility what would be some of the options we would explore yeah so that so the circumstance you're talking about is this really kind of frustrating scenario where where a kidney transplant canada has done the right things they've taken care of themselves they've gotten to a transplant center they're listed you know for transplant we think they're a good candidate they've even gone to the effort that you just described of identifying living donors and the living donor or donors that they identify are not compatible with them or at least safely so as you said they might be of a different blood type let's say you know i'm an a and you're a b that's just not a barrier that we're used to crossing at least with any kind of reasonable likelihood of the success rates we were discussing earlier um it may also be that that uh you you know i have preformed antibodies to hla antigens that that you have and it turns out there's certain populations that are more prone to that to that challenge so it's a it's a really frustrating challenge because here it is it's like you have this you know you've got this diamond in the rough but you can't apply it you know and so what some really smart people figured out well if i've got two pairs and they're incompatible with each other but happen to be compatible with the opposite so let's say that you know we're an a and a b and there's another pair over here that's a bna and by all other measures are compatible is it reasonable to swap those kidneys and and those sorts of swap kidney swaps or parrot exchange began in the 1990s and and really took off in the 2000s because it allowed people to avail themselves of broader opportunities for transplant now what you're alluding to in terms of the kind of the mathematics of it is you can imagine there's some ethical quandaries there so let's say so you come forward to donate me a kidney you're extremely healthy person you're taking good care of yourself i assume jill has approved this at some point i haven't asked her but you know she can't wait to say hi to you after this podcast so i think she would let me donate to you happily that's that's an important part of the discussion um but then let's say the pair that we were talking about exchanging with is you know someone about our age who needs a kidney and their 75 year old father you know so i swapped to them this you know perfectly healthy kidney from someone who's in good health and younger and i get in exchange for that a 75 year old kidney now for some of the reasons we just talked about it might still be in my best interest to take that living donor kidney but you can imagine that there are differences in quality and then to add even more complexity to it what if let's say the the individual that you would be donating to across the swap you just by coincidence are a perfect match for you know hla a match across the board but that that individual that i'm swapping for i have it's three mismatched yeah it's exactly or or or maybe there's even you know we there's very sophisticated assays that actually can look for low levels of what we call donor specific antibodies then let's say that i've got some you know low level uh antibodies to that individual is it worth the the swap is it worth the extra immuno suppression i would need to make that a reality to make that pair exchange work and so some smart people including colleagues of ours that we both know dory segev and his wife summer gentry who's a mathematician started thinking about that like so could we could we start putting some value on those exchanges and create networks of individuals it's kind of like the dating game for kidneys where you come forward with your donor and the algorithm looks at all the other possible pairs and tries to matches match individuals in a way that maximizes predicted outcome and the there are now national networks that facilitate those sorts of exchanges and have really expanded kidney transplantation in ways that i don't think even we would have predicted watching it back in the 1990s you know for example there was a day maybe three weeks ago where i did a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy operation so removed a kidney from a individual that morning one of my colleagues was doing a similar operation in another room both those kidneys shipped out to other institutions two kidneys came back later and and our colleagues put them in later in the day into two of our recipients so it was like you know we've completely dissociated the the the donor operation from the recipient operation which from a patient's perspective is great you know so the donors don't have to travel the recipients have more access to organs and and you know i think thinking about how that is applied and expanded has really been a game changer for for kidney transplantation access chris is there any serious discussion about opening up a market for kidney donation so everything we just described is it's happening through altruism i would give you my kidney because i love you um but is there a serious discussion that says look what if i've just decided you know what like i can i'm willing to gamble but i don't need a kidney i don't know a given individual but for a big enough sum of money i'm willing to part with my kidney those discussions even entertained yeah so it's a great great question and and there this is a frequently debated and um and never resolved kind of debate in transplantation so to put some framework behind that question so when when transplantation started to become a successful medical intervention so we're talking now 70s into the 1980s development of cyclosporine we then started to think about so okay this is a successful venture we now have you know organ donation laws that are that exists around the country we need to create networks to make sure that you know a liver that becomes available in utah is is accessible to the patient in michigan as it to the to california or or other circumstances so there was a whole infrastructure put around that um that challenge the the legality of it was in the decision that was made at the time these laws were passed that it was illegal to sell an organ and the reasons that that principle was upheld is kind of central to transplantation particularly in the united states but in most countries around the world is that the the belief was that organ donation was a gift it was a decision so the the kind of ethical decision was or principle was that the donor has autonomy over that decision and makes it freely the concern about allowing people to pay for organs like on an open market was that can potentially be coercive and and can create markets where individuals who have you know lower standing in society or are economically disadvantaged um then are put in this the position where they can be selling their organs to to to achieve some game and actually just literally this last weekend there was an article in the new york times about the growth of kidney transplantation in afghanistan and that is exactly what happened they have kind of turned the other turned away from understanding relationships between donors and recipients and that's what's happened that wealthy people who have the resources are paying poor people for their kidneys and then not certainly caring for them afterwards so so as a general principle the the transplant community has decided against paying for organs as the principle being that it's coercive now there's lots of people that disagree with that on general principle and say well why don't we just create a better system allow some exchange of compensation to donors and and i think we are slowly migrating towards some version of that so to give you a few examples the the legality of this has been so tight that it's been impossible even for for donors to be reimbursed for like transportation to the transplant center or time off work or other sacrifices that they had to personally make that had nothing to do with kind of the actual donation but just to facilitate that occurring and there are now um uh legal there are laws being passed in states and other and other initiatives either through um advocacy groups there's a a national group that that does advocacy for living donors and provides resources and support for travel to transplant centers and and reimbursement for for time away from work and such but you know what if we created a principle where say for example a living donor you know is compensated with some agreed upon amount of money that compensates for the time of their recovery and you know i think there there may come a time that that um some version of that becomes a reality there's also principles of you know should should living donation provide special kind of health care benefits to individuals over time you know kind of it maybe it qualifies you for discounted you know public insurance or something so that you can never use lose health insurance if you were to god forbid have a problem yourself down the road so i think there are some versions of this that will come to fruition gradually but i think at least in the united states kind of our medical legal environment and the principles behind transplantation will not um permit an open market you know for for um buying and selling of organs i like that idea though about providing ongoing medical coverage uh it's funny whenever the debate comes up about whether we should be paying um nc2a athletes especially the football players right they generate so much revenue for the university and then you know you know they get spanked if they accept like a 50 gift from a booster um i've always thought one solution to that is fine if you don't want to pay athletes for you know playing sports at a university you should at least cover their medical bills for the rest of their lives like if an athlete suffers some consequence as a result of playing sports which many of them do um we should at least you know make sure that we take care of them if we're going to profit off them to the course of that tell folks a little bit about if it's still the case i assume it's still the case there are some states in which you're better off or more likely to get a an organ like a liver for example than other states how does that work and what would be the best states to live in if you're vying for an organ versus the worst right so fortunately that is changing rapidly and it's changing rapidly because it's been um a focus of intentional policy change so it's not like when we were in residency where it was almost comical correct so i think part of the issue is is simply um a supply and demand issue so if you look for example like california you know a state with a huge population um and uh you know there is such a demand for transplant that if you restricted if you if you kind of imagine california as just its own unit it's almost like the organ donation supply in california would never meet the the demand that's true in other major particularly urban population centers like new york and parts of the east coast there are other parts of the country and they tend to be in the midwest but there's some other locations in the south as well where just based on population size the amount of individuals in need of an organ transplant is is modest compared to the supply of organ donors and i think that has created this disparity where depending on where you live you may have better access to organ in various places the solution to that obviously is to change the system so in other words you know the way that organ donation is coordinated nationally is through these organizations called organ procurement organizations or opo's there's 58 of them in the country some of them are pretty easily understandable like michigan has for example one opo that covers the whole state there's like six in texas so it's it's it's a little bit of a confusing network but the point is those are the organizations that nonprofit organizations that are responsible for identifying organ donors and and facilitating the gift from from procurement to to transplant and then the the waiting list you hear people say that they're they're on the waiting list for an organ the way that an organ is actually placed is every time an organ donor becomes available the the list is run according to a predetermined algorithm of of how that particular organ is prioritized and the problem at least historically is that that list has been run largely locally or regionally first and only then kind of offered out more broadly and so what has changed in heart lung and liver transplantation and is about to change in kidney transplantation is those kind of relatively artificial state or regional boundaries have just gotten destroyed and so now the way organs are allocated are literally by concentric circles so they offer it you know based on distance from the donor hospital and that has um created some interesting um you know phenomena i mean the good news is to your point is that the geographic variation uh that exists across the country has decreased so it's not as important now to like go to a certain place if you know you need a liver transplant for example um it it also has created a system where if you're really sick you know at the top of the list for liver transplantation for example you're going to get transplanted quickly because you've got access to this broad swath of organ toners the the challenge is kind of the people that are medium sick some of whom are still quite ill from their disease who have all these sicker people kind of ahead of them on the list uh getting transplanted and that's speaks to the kind of need for expanding the donor pool alternative donor sources more living donation in the case of kidney and liver transplantation to kind of meet that that need so so the system has gotten more fair but it's only exposed the need even more i guess is the best way to say it that's good to hear because it definitely struck me as as a pretty unjust system you know 20 years ago especially with liver where you could you know it was almost like the uh yeah it reminded me of some great injustice um you you alluded to brain death earlier we've been remiss in not i think explaining to people a little bit what that means and um especially now as we sort of talk a little bit about liver where a much greater number of the transplantations are from non-living donors uh the donors are are non-living um so what does it mean to be brain dead and and how does that factor into um from from a legal standpoint what does it mean and then from a physiologic and biological standpoint what does it mean yeah so it's it's a it's interesting you would think that this would be like something you could flip to page one and you know medical textbook and there would be you know but it's actually been a relatively kind of complex set of definitions to come to um and and the the importance of establishing brain death was in many ways driven by the development of transplantation because if we were going to use organ deceased organ donors for transplant we needed to establish clear clearly defined ways that these were individuals that could not recover you know we're not going to to be salvageable such that they could be then go on to be organ donors and to be even more specific about that the the the whole question of what defines death you know so is death when the heart stops or is or do we consider death when the brain has lost function and control and and what has to clarify that for people right the first thing you said is when the heart stops is what we call cardiopulmonary death so right a person has a heart attack the heart stops cardiopulmonary death a person has cancer eventually leads to cardiopulmonary death correct this brain death thing how what is it how does it show up give people examples of the physical way the physiological ways people get there yeah so it's a it's a it's a kind of confusing concept how can the body be alive but the brain be dead and there there are a whole number of circumstances where that can occur but essentially the the kind of central um component of the definition is that the brain sustains an injury that could be from anoxia from an anoxic event it can be it can be literally from a traumatic event you know a penetrating injury a devastating head trauma it can be from an inner cranial event a bleed or such such that the pressure in the brain and the injury that evolves in the brain increases to a point that blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain stops and so all the cellular processes that are occurring kind of from literally the skull base up are have have stopped and you know there there are clinical ways to define that diagnosis so there are characteristic neurologic manifestations of brain death you know the the kind of classic ones that you see on tv are the you know the blown pupils as someone's brain has swollen to the uh to not to no longer um prevent or sorry to no longer allow blood flow into the skull um you know there are core bodily functions that the brain drives such as respiratory drive that are part of that definition as well as as well as a bunch of additional primitive reflexes and and really what evolved over time is a clinical definition of brain death that includes multiple elements including that the pa that the donor has sorry that the individual has to be you know hemodynamically stable they can't be hypothermic they can't be in some metabolic condition that could confuse the issue but then the central focus of it is this thing called an apnea test where they literally stop the mechanical breathing support and see whether or not the individual generates the drive to breathe on their own and so there are there are clinical brain death exams that that physicians are used to doing to document that and then there are ancillary studies that can actually show that blood flow has stopped into the brain and i think coming to a consensus on that definition was really critical to allow the establishment of what what equates with death so the loss of the function of that individual even if their other physiologic functions like their heart beating are maintained and and establishing that diagnosis then allowed the step to go from well if they are brain dead but they're still have present circulation can we then move to organ procurement because in the absence of that you could kind of ethically equate organ procurement as as prompting death right so in other words if these individuals are not yet dead organ procurement is expediting their debt which with their death which violates all the principles of of kind of autonomy and the principle of of organ donation um that transplantation is built on so there's a couple things there i just want to highlight before you go on chris just so people understand their brain death still requires cardiopulmonary support all right that's the that's the very important thing people need to understand a brain dead individual is not going to be laying in a bed their brain not functioning yet somehow they're alive by definition if your brain is dead and you are not on full cardio respiratory support you will be dead within moments so that's why this apnic test is done while they're hooked up to a respirator that is just turned off but not disconnected they will fail to breathe as you point out they will fail the apnic test and then they'll be resumed on cardiopulmonary support because of course the goal is to continue to oxygenate their body perfectly to maintain um you know the appropriate levels of tissue health i think the other thing that's worth mentioning it's not funny if you watch tv you might be lulled into thinking that the same set of doctors that are trying to understand if you're brain dead and trying to take care of you after whatever accident you had that led to the situation you're in have anything to do with the doctors that are coming along to take the kid in your liver and because that would seem that would seem a little uh you know a a little uh grotesque right so explain that sort of line between those two teams of physicians because you know you and i have been multiple times on both sides of that we've been taking care of those patients in the icu that are going to become donors and then we've been the you know on the other side where you're now part of the team that's harvesting organs correct so it's a it's a clear ethical principle that is central to not only the kind of effective operationalizing of transplant but also to the to the establishment of the public trust that is critical to allowing transplantation to exist and you know the way i explain that to to transplant families and organ donor families is that the the systems are completely separate with an opportunity for integration in between that only occurs when certain events has happened in the in the individual's care so number one the the concept of of brain death has to be thought about to begin with you know that that's part of the diagnostic evaluation of that individual the brain death exam needs to be confirmed the the uh family and or patient through previous uh documentation has identified that individual as an organ donor and only then after those steps are is the transplant machinery or specifically the organ procurement organization involved so so i think some people have the concern well gosh are the are the people that want more organs for transplant gonna somehow interfere in the decisions that are made about this individual who's undergone some tragedy that's leading to the end of their life and the reality of that is fortunately that we have no impact on that on that decision the i think the other principle that occurs is that then the care of that individual body because if they've been declared brain death we consider the individual diet then passes from the caregivers the health care team that's been caring for them to the organ procure procurement organization and their team and then eventually to the to the transplant teams that do the procurement so there's a clear transition from when they go from an individual under the care of icu team or or the teams that are caring for them to the to the individual shooters responsibility it is to facilitate the gift of transplant and i think in situations that fortunately occur more and more often where either the individual themself have already identified on their driver's license or through conversations with their family that they in the event of a tragedy they want to be an organ donor or families come forward and and i always think this is incredibly generous i mean this usually occurs out of the worst day of their life and they come forward to say that they would they would want their loved one to be an organ donor nothing nothing happens on the transplant side until all those steps have occurred and so i think it's really kind of critical to understand that it is worth alluding to the concept of donation after cardiac death which is where that gets a little more confusing so there are there are individuals who have suffered a life life-threatening event um a devastating head trauma but that has not caused brain death other medical conditions where the care team and the caregivers have decided that their their life is not salvageable but they're not technically brain death and that's always been a conundrum because what if those individuals want to donate their organs but they don't meet this very strict criteria that we've established as a important principle to allow organ donation and what has evolved in the united states and around the world uh over time is this concept of donation after cardiac death and importantly there still needs to be the establishment of death before we can procure organs to again separate the process of declaring death from the process of procuring organs and so what happens in a donation after after cardiac death situation is the family chooses to withdraw care care is withdrawn the individual then expires over some period of time and then depending on the circumstances of that individual's death how quickly it happens etc if they we then believe it's appropriate to still utilize those organs organ procurement can can occur and those decisions are all made before withdrawal of care so in other words the family has decided to to uh proceed with pursuing organ donation the arrangements have been made to have the teams and individuals available there uh to to procure the organs and preserve the organs appropriately but nothing happens until that individual is declared dead by a provider that has nothing to do with the transplant team so i think even in the case of donation after cardiac death we've kept that very clear delineation between individuals caring for the patient and individuals processing the gift of the donor for transplant you alluded to something earlier which reminds me of one of the sadder stories when i was um i was in i was in residency actually when this happened so my mom one of my mom's closest closest friends um her son who was five years younger than me so i knew we grew up together uh was was uh driving home one morning after a night shift and fell asleep um crashed and died you know an immediate brain death and um his mom single mom no relationship to his father um you know had to make this whole you know what can only be described as as you said the worst the worst day of your life and now you have to make a decision and you know i'll never forget she she made this decision to have every every single aspect of her son donated you know corneas skin he his liver was split into two so two people benefited from his livers both kidneys heart lungs um it it's it's it's always stuck with me um and and if that wasn't enough a couple years later i would go on to meet a friend um that i ended up working with actually who lost his son to his he was in a jeep accident rollover jeep and same thing you know he and his wife had to make this awful decision about their 21 year old son who had just died and without hesitation they did the same thing which was yeah you know every piece of our son aaron who was his name is is going to be you know donated to help someone else and what was especially amazing in the case of um of this couple i think i can say their names i don't i think they're actually quite vocal about this jeff and tina webster um is that they got to know every one of the recipients um and as i got to know them and got to know the stories i was just you know i was just blown away by it and again i'm someone who's been around this stuff right like it's not like i haven't seen these things before but um you know the the man who got his liver has a tattoo of their son on his arm you know it's that kind of stuff right and it's it's just it's it is hard to believe i mean did people ever ask you chris um hey should i should i check that box on my driver's license and and like how do you talk to people about those decisions yeah it's a great question and it is one that i that i get asked and actually my oldest daughter tells me she occasionally gets asked now i guess because people know her dad's a transplant surgeon but you know i think um you know i think so what are the reasons that people hesitate to to do that and i think some of it is what we already alluded to is kind of the the concern or the mythology that somehow it'll affect their own health care and and you know sometimes i'll answer questions about that but but i always try to focus on the the profound impact that transplantation can have and try to share with them uh what i've learned from donor families over the years i mean one of the privileges of the position i am in now is that i do get to occasionally do advocacy work and other other opportunities to meet donor families so families like you just told of the websters that have a history of a family member who was an organ donor and many of them can you know poignantly tell of the the process they walked through with that decision making and the memories of their loved one but one of the things that donor families you know really universally share is that their experience of organ donation or not they were able to meet the eventual recipients of their uh loved ones organs but that the experience of organ donation and knowing that their loved one's organs went on live on in another individual and save their life is the only good thing about what was otherwise the worst day of their lives and i've heard that actual phrasing repeated by multiple families by multiple individuals who had to say goodbye to their you know son daughter sister brother you know husband wife but took some solace in the fact that you were honoring their life by passing on the gift of their organs to another individual so i think it's important for people to hear that it is really a can be a transformative gift i think the other thing i share with people and let them make their own decisions is that you know there is an incredible need for organ donation you know so there are currently more than a hundred thousand you know people waiting on the waiting list for the various organs and and you know each year there are you know less than uh you know 40 or so of that number done you know and the the need only grows each year the gap between donation and supply grows each year furthermore the outcomes of the individuals who get transplanted improves each year so not only do we have this tremendous need for individuals dying of organ failure but the life that they can look forward to is in most cases you know incredibly good you know restoring them back to um you know life expectancies that approximate normal and qualities of life that in many cases are totally normal so i i mean i think that's the vision i try to share with people when they're considering organ donation but acknowledge that it's a very personal decision and people have to be comfortable with that i do encourage people if they feel passionately about it to make the decision themselves because i can tell you like you said you know we've been on both sides of this that that walking through that decision making with someone's loved one who is in you know the middle of the night in a foreign hospital trying to make the decision about the wishes of their loved one isn't is an impossible task so the more that you can you know register yourself or and communicate that to your family the actual easier you make it on your loved ones god forbid they end up in that situation having to facilitate that gift yeah i think that's the point you can think of this as an advance directive which actually is the biggest service you can give to people around you so that they don't have to there's no ambiguity about what your wishes are so we've talked a lot about kidney but i i you know i think i'd be remiss if we didn't spend some time talking about the liver which is really the bread and butter of your clinical practice and it's certainly one of the most technically demanding operations in the field it's no surprise then that uh the most amazing surgical resident i ever got to train alongside is doing the pinnacle of what surgery offers let's go back to the 1960s there's a young guy it's 1963 there's this guy nobody's ever heard of thomas starzell um he's he's plugging away at this operation he actually i think if i'm not mistaken was the first guy to figure out that you could add prednisone to immuran and actually increase survival to levels that were still abysmal by today's standards but reasonable you know i think he was getting 70 survival at one year but four years later a three-year-old boy dies on the operating table bleeds to death and at that point people sort of had enough and there was kind of as you alluded to earlier this moratorium on liver transplants until we figure this out more let's start with the technical aspect of it what is it about the liver that is so difficult to surgically implant yeah so i mean the liver is the largest solid organ in the body it has some interesting anatomical nuances it has a dual blood supply so it's supplied by the hepatic artery which is a major branch essentially off the aorta as well as the portal vein which is the blood drainage of all of the intestinal blood flow and the reason that returns through the liver is the liver is the filter essentially the metabolic filter for the the metabolites absorbed in the gi tract it then lives on top of the vena cava the major vein returning blood from the lower part of the body back to the heart and actually sits right below the diaphragm right below the right atrium where it has this complex venous network that drains into the vena cava so it's it's um anatomically made not to be messed with in some ways is the way you'll hear people talk about it i mean and in addition to that you then have all the intra-hepatic anatomy which you know which can be uh profoundly complex as well but the thing that makes liver transplantation really the challenge that it is surgically is not so much the anatomy which you know fortunately with experience you learn how to navigate it's the fact that liver failure at least the the diseases for which we most commonly transplant so the development of cirrhosis or the end stages of chronic liver injury and fibrosis leads not only to synthetic failure of the liver so the liver loses the ability to process some of those metabolites it loses its ability to make new proteins including some of the proteins that help your blood clot and other important functions but because the liver is become this scarred fibrotic organ all of that blood flow that's returning from the intestines has to make its way through what used to be this soft compliant sponge and is now literally the consistency of a of a rock and so the what happens is you develop this condition called portal hypertension where the the blood the pressure in the portal venous system increases such that it tries to find other ways back to the heart and so it it forms collateral channels that's those collateral channels are what what form the varices or varicosities that that develop in the gi tract that can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage and liver patients it's what leads to the formation of ascites or the fluid retention that you see in patients with liver disease with these huge protuberant distended abdomens and it also makes the surgical field this kind of rat's nest of collateral venous vessels so so you've got the challenge of a large you know organ with challenging anatomy you have the challenge of this condition that makes the dissection and the predilection towards bleeding even higher and then you have the synthetic function which is occurs in the setting of a you're doing this operation in the setting of an individual who's not making normal normal clotting factors so it's really both the circumstance of the technical challenge but more more often the the um the circumstances in the in which you're doing it and you know as you know liver failure leads to cachexia and muscle loss so these are debilitated sick patients that you're then doing a big operation on in sub-optimal conditions and so the fact that tom starzell and his contemporaries took that operation on in the 1960s when electrocautery wasn't really a thing most hospitals didn't really have blood banks we didn't even have kind of critical care anesthesia at least with any you know resemblance to what it is now i mean it's pretty remarkable that that was even conceptualized much less achieved technically and as you alluded to it was really their realization that not only was the procedure so technically demanding that the risk of early mortality was quite high but you were doing it in an immunologic setting that just was not successful and so you know even the patients that survived the operation in the early recovery there were really no survivors past 90 days and the first you know dozens of transplants done which is what led to the moratorium on liver transplantation that occurred in the late 60s and i would add one other thing to punctuate everything you said chris which is not only are these the sickest patients i've ever seen i mean these patients are staggeringly sick but they lack something that every other sick patient has prior to a transplantation so whether we're talking about cardiac transplantation pulmonary transplantation pancreatic transplantation renal transplantation all of those organs have some form of extracorporeal support that is offered to them to at least bridge the gap or tune them up a little bit prior to surgery the liver remains the only major organ with no form of extracorporeal support now i i could spend an hour giving you my theories as to why that's the case i think it speaks i'll give you the punch line i think it speaks to one particular function of the liver although i think there are many but i think the one that just can't be done by a machine is the regulation of blood glucose it is so complicated to manage gluconeogenesis glycogen storage i mean you have to be able to regulate something to the milligram level with with seconds to spare there are probably a dozen other reasons but you know every attempt at extracorporeal liver support has failed including some crazy stories that you know i heard from god one of our one of the transplant surgeons i remember it might have been montgomery even told a story about the baboon yeah that's that's a mel williams story oh that's right that's right mel williams why don't you tell folks that story actually it's just the scariest thing so um you know what you're alluding to is exactly correct so there have been all kinds of uh both mechanical and even you know in atomic models trying to address liver dysfunction or to bridge that gap you know from liver failure to transplant and nothing has worked real well i mean essentially we've tried you know what's been called liver dialysis so in other words trying to remove some of the toxins from the bloodstream that the liver is responsible for filtering we've we've tried things that do address the portal hypertension so at least you kind of alleviate that problem but nothing has replaced the synthetic function that you described so one of the obvious um kind of conjectures well what if well then we need a physiologic solution to this could we um support patients particularly patients with acute liver failure where the injury is acute and the liver is this incredible organ in that it does have this regenerative capacity hepatocytes will replenish over time so the thinking was well if someone comes in with a tylenol overdose or an acute viral toxicity to their liver could we just bridge them long enough until those new hepatocytes start to come into play and so it was under that principle that the concept of well can we do some sort of extracorporeal model to support these patients and so mel williams who was the um he he was a contemporary and a student of david hume who was one of the godfathers of liver or excuse me of transplant and transplant immunology specifically um christian barnard who did the first heart transplant actually trained in his lab and dr williams you know uh worked there as well and then eventually came to hopkins and started the transplant program at johns hopkins he was a kidney transplant recipient eventually himself received a living donor kidney from his wife and unfortunately died recently um you know later in age not related to his transplant a remarkable kind of luminary figure and one of the best storytellers you know you've ever heard but he tells a story of that they decided well why don't we address acute liver failure by hooking up the patient to a extracorporeal essentially you know bypass circuit and put a baboon on the other side of the circulation so the baboon's liver would essentially filter the toxins out they'd be the blood would be returned to the individual and that would address their acute liver failure and so they worked on this prep and they did all kinds of pre-clinical studies and eventually they had somebody come in with acute liver failure and you know i don't know the specifics of irb regulations at that time but sure enough they got approval to um to do this and one of the things they quickly realized is and i don't know any of the veterinary medicine behind this but you can't sedate a baboon very easily you know it takes herculean doses of you know sedatives so and you can't have a baboon running around the medical ic unit at johns hopkins hospital so they decided and maybe what wasn't the most ingenious method to put the baboon in a body cast so they would at least the baboon would be frozen to the bed so they do the preparation and um you know unbelievably it starts to work so the the patient's encephalopathy clears the patient starts to wake up so this poor individual wakes up in the icu at johns hopkins he doesn't know what's happened to him looks over and there's a baboon lying next to him in the bed next to him so what does he do he tries to get up and start pulling at lines so the solution they decided to that is they actually put him in a body cast so there was a baboon and this poor individual in a body cast in the icu next uh next to each other in johns hopkins and that that um was a short-lived series of experiments but it did prove the principle that that would work you know that the that if you had an actual functional liver in circulation with an individual and actually he went on to do some preparations between for example family members if a family member came in with acute liver failure you could put them in cross circulation with you know a sibling or something and some of those did did work and maintain those patients it also led to the principle that is part of a investigational product now that created this essential a dialysis column populated with hepatocytes you know with with a kind of a hepatocyte stem cell line that populates the parasites and that has been shown at least in some uh studies to at least provide some limited short-term support uh as well so but the principle behind what you said is absolutely right that we have not figured out how to provide extracorporeal support for liver patients so they really are the patients that face death if they are not able to be transplanted in a timely fashion one of the most stark memories i have from residency on the um on the side of patients that would ultimately need a transplant was uh probably my second year in the old sicu and um a a young woman came in she was 21 years old she overdosed on tylenol and it's funny when you realize how dangerous tylenol is and yet how willy-nilly it's available um yeah you know the you know this of course but just for folks listening the ld50 the lethal dose at which 50 of the population would be dead from a drug that's a you know that one would know that for every drug out there what's the ld50 of fentanyl what's the ld fit well the ld50 of tylenol might only be 10 to 20 times beyond what you would normally take for your headache and so the ease with which a person can end their life with with tylenol is is is staggeringly high and as was the case in with this with this girl you know i think she broke up with her boyfriend and took a bottle of tylenol and by the time she sort of realized that this was a bad idea it was too late and there was the saddest memory i have chris is the following before she really went into acute liver failure and and then suffered sort of the encephalopathy that would then rob her of her cognition while we waited for a transplant there was a lucid period of time when her pt you know inr ptt were through the roof lfts were through the roof and it was very clear she was going to die without a liver transplant and yet she was cognizant enough to know that and i don't remember how big that window was but it it was it existed now we could have been wrong maybe she was gonna recover but but it turned out she ended up getting transplanted um and it was it was just amazing to see her wake up from that and realize like she had another lease on life and you could say i mean look someone could say well she made a dumb mistake you know and maybe she didn't deserve another chance but of course i would say who among us hasn't done really dumb things yeah um it's so true it's it's you know fortunately acute liver failure only accounts for about five percent of the liver transplants done in the united states so it's a relatively uncommon situation in part because the liver is pretty resilient so sometimes even a catastrophic you know overdose if with good critical care and and other measures many of those patients will recover but um you know we are often faced with the situation where just exactly like you described a person comes in with a tylenol overdose it's an intentional overdose or at least as you know suicidal type gesture and we have to make the decision with limited information about whether or not we think they're an appropriate transplant candidate and you know occasionally there are reasons why they're not you know uncontrolled comorbid disease or maybe you know other uh factors but usually it's exactly the circumstance you described it's a young distressed person who reacted badly to a you know a particular event and makes a very important decision impossible with a with a freely available drug like out of their medicine cabinet you know and i think what the approach of our center which i think is true of most transplant centers is to give those patients the benefit of the doubt and try and get them to transplant rapidly and then use all the appropriate resources afterwards to help support them and make sure that any mental health issues and such are addressed so it they are tragic and dramatic circumstances they can be incredibly rewarding you know transplants as you would imagine though to see them literally get transformed you know from the transplant chris when you and i were in medical school and residency for that matter it seemed abundantly clear that hepatitis c was going to overwhelm the liver transplant infrastructure within the united states today there's good news and there's bad news the good news is that hepatitis c is not going to overwhelm the liver transplant infrastructure of the united states the bad news is that something else is going to do that and that's nafldy and nash can you tell us the twin stories of these two things and and yeah how is it that that uh that something that we believed could never be cured got cured yep and then how is it that this thing that we didn't know existed 20 years ago is going to be if it not already is the leading indication for liver transplant in the developed world it's such a kind of at once compelling but also humbling story and i'll in telling it i'll add even a third actor that you know is is part of this as well so um hepatitis c is as you alluded to you know a viral illness um bloodborne illness that can um this has kind of an interesting history some people that are exposed to it so hepatitis c rarely causes an acute illness fortunately some people that are exposed to it can clear the virus so spontaneously clear the virus but the majority are left with chronic viremia and subsequent uh inflammation which is which is silent for years and in some cases decades so the the kind of history of this in the united states is that people were exposed to this you know in the 70s and 80s either due to a time when the blood supply was not really tested for uh astringently and they acquired it through blood transfusion or they acquired it from use of iv drugs or other exposures but then it went about their life and then here they are 20 30 years later with cirrhosis and eventual complications of cirrhosis and and indication for transplant and that and for about 20 years that was the predominant indication for transplant in the united states which was a challenge because the medications we had to treat hepatitis c were not particularly effective you know response rates of 15 to 30 percent or so so every one of those patients got recurrent hepatitis c after their transplant and many went on to develop graft failure you know and cirrhosis essentially of their transplanted grafts so it was a it was a particularly frustrating clinical problem because there was this enormous need but also we were only kind of partially solving the problem um and you know what has happened and what you're alluding to is in the last 10 years essentially was the development of these direct anti-anti-viral agents that have transformed the field of hepatitis c and it's you know you can make some arguments about what's the greatest medical advance we've witnessed in our you know medical career but that's up in the top two or three um yeah i don't i don't think i could think of something more impressive in my i mean adult money maybe you could argue the the you know retroviral regimens that made hiv a chronic disease instead of a it could could rival it but but i mean this is transformative so you take patients who were on a certain path towards liver failure and death cure their viremia and what we what we actually anticipated would happen was that all the patients who already had cirrhosis would eventually go on to need transplant anyway but what we've seen is a precipitous drop in the number of patients needing transplant for hepatitis c um because once they clear the virus their liver does you know recompensate and repair somewhat and the patients that are not serotic or with advanced fibrosis yet are never going to get there so it is it is truly a curative situation so that drop has happened precipitously over the last you know three to five years it has been replaced you know nearly completely by actually two diseases the the first and the one that has this kind of incredible broad public health impact is is that is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or the concept of fatty deposition in the liver that leads to chronic inflammation and kind of just like a chronic virus you know ongoing inflammation fibrosis eventually cirrhosis and with the obesity epidemic and other associated diseases the prediction is that by 2030 or so it will become the leading indication for liver transplantation and we've already seen that curve start to inflect up pretty highly the only thing that makes the story a little more interesting or frustrating is there's another curve that over the last several years has inflected even you know at a steeper slope and that is the the uh incidence of alcohol-related liver disease which is has always been you know a important cause of liver disease in the united states but unfortunately and you know whether you blame it on the economic downturn in the late 2000s or other factors you know really have seen an explosion of alcohol-related liver disease made worse by the way by the pandemic and i think that has occurred at a time when transplant centers have adapted their approach to patients with alcohol related liver disease to make it a little less of kind of this terrible spanish inquisition kind of approach to you know you're either in or out you know if if we think you're committed to sobriety to a system where we have developed resources mental health professionals counselors and such to support people in their sobriety to allow them to get transplanted successfully so you know i hope that that curve plateaus we unfortunately don't have an intervention for fatty liver disease that i see breaking that you know the slope of that curve uh quickly um and you know it has changed our field because you know the the population of patients with fatty liver disease is much different than the patient the population with chronic liver disease of other causes whether it's alcohol hepatitis c you know most of those patients have liver disease and the consequences of liver disease but usually fortunately not much in the way of other morbidity whereas you take the fatty liver disease patient population they are first of all often obese which you know poses surgical risk and other challenges but on top of that they have all the other manifestations of their metabolic syndrome they have cardiovascular disease hyperlipidemia etc which poses you know medical management challenges both for making sure we select patients that are likely to be successful with transplant but also with caring for them afterwards i mean the the you'll hear the comments said that we're we've kind of converted our liver transplant population to look a lot more like our kidney transplant population because they're dealing with these cardiovascular comorbidities and other things that are just um that are threatening their long-term survival as much as their liver disease and immunosuppression is you know i sort of think that the the the uptick in alcohol associated uh liver disease or athol d say um is kind of the parallel but gets less attention than what we're seeing with the opiate crisis so i think the the opiate crisis is i i think it's easy and understandable that you would throw the manufacturers under the bus and in truth they deserve to be thrown under the bus um and you can throw the physicians under the bus who make who prescribe them to freely and that's fair as well but the elephant in the room is the why right like why is it that people are self-medicating with opiates that are made too freely available etc and i think with opiates because the outcomes can be quite binary and stark in the nature of the overdose the nature of the death it becomes very easy to focus on that but acute alcohol toxicity is virtually unheard of very few people will drink themselves to death in a moment right much more common of course is the chronic toxicity of alcohol and i think that you know you're one of the few um specialists within medicine as a transplant doc or a hepatologist who actually gets to see what that looks like but i think it doesn't really register for most people that they're basically two and two sides of the same coin yeah i totally agree with you and i think we unfortunately um it's it's that perception that they're different or the fact that we kind of both medically and society-wise treat them differently has prevented us from addressing the problem with the appropriate attention it needs you know one of our hepatologists here at the university of michigan jessica mellinger who's really dedicated her career to understanding alcohol-related liver disease as she has refined kind of her approach to the evaluation and management of these diseases you know she really makes the sense that the the um emphasizes the point that this is a behavioral disease you know uh you could argue nash can be a behavioral disease in some cases as well but therefore the resources have to be put forth to address the behavioral disease um and i think you know we have kind of largely turned a blind eye at um the impact of alcohol-related liver disease and alcohol use disorder in our society because of the just the factors you said it's a it's a freely available you know um substance you know it's you don't have to go you know the the machinations and just kind of destruction that people have to go through their life to get opiates that's that's not the case for alcohol you can go the 7-11 and get you know that the kind of equivalently damaging dose you know there and i think it's made the problem much harder to address and i i am glad to see the transplant community and the medical community kind of re pivoting in our focus towards trying to help people address the the reasons you know why they're uh involved in this cycle because it is tragic and one of the things that's most notable about the alcohol-related liver disease population now is they are ridiculously young you know so not only have they drank enough to destroy their liver but they've drank enough to destroy their liver in their 20s and 30s you know which is a which is a little different than kind of the kind of classic you know 65 year old guy who's been drinking all his life and you know gets to the end of his life that's right most of us think of the mickey mantle story where you know it's it's exactly what you described but no i think i think it it is the same disease and yet one uh one population numbs with an acute numbing agent opiates that have an acute toxicity and the other numbs with a chronic numbing agent that has a chronic toxicity and yeah to consider to to somehow put those into different silos um when i think the underlying conditions are similar is is probably slowing our progress yeah i totally agree i totally hear chris i think the last thing i want to talk about from a transplant perspective and there's so much i want to talk about but i want to be respectful of your time and i know you've got to head off to a meeting shortly um you talked about the team right one of the things about transplant that attracted you to it was the team and i think it's probably not obvious to people how big that is it's obvious to me because i got to see it during residency but i don't think there's a field of medicine that has a bigger team when you encompass i mean the only one that i could maybe think of would be like that would rival it might be pediatric cardiac surgery where you just have such you know the the overlap is huge but but even that might not be as big as what we're talking about here in terms of the perfusionists and the surgeons and the anesthesiologists and the nursing and the icu and then the logistics associated with organ procurement it's an enormous team and you lost a number of team members a while ago shortly shortly after you got to michigan um i think that story is obviously tragic but also highlights the incredible risk that goes into this do you mind telling that story a little bit yeah sure so what you're referring to was a in june of 2007 we had a team that had flown from michigan to wisconsin to retrieve lungs for one of our recipients they had actually procured the lungs they had just taken off from milwaukee and [Music] you know had a tragic uh set of circumstances that happened to the plane and tried to turn it around and get back to milwaukee and essentially crashed into lake michigan um that shortly thereafter and all six individuals on board uh died um and it does um there's a there's a story in there about how important teamwork is in transplantation you know so six people lost their life as one small part of trying to get this uh set of lungs to a recipient there were two pilots on board who passed away two of our profusion staff so individuals who are responsible for the the coordination of kind of the procurement operation the handling of the organ its preservation transport back to the recipient team and then two surgeons there was a cardiac surgeon and actually a fellow who died in that accident as well and i can tell you that you know first and foremost it's it's hard to speak about it now without um getting emotional it was the uh you know most devastating event that i've ever witnessed professionally you know directly um you know there was a patient on the table chest open on the table as the lungs were flying back that operation had to be stopped uh you know one of our uh coordinators who is the person responsible for you know sorting all these logistics was the person who figured out that the plane had gone down and then had to tell our team uh you know what had occurred uh it was uh devastating you know to to to put it mildly not to mention most importantly the loss that those families sustained um you know i think um it it shook us all in a way that i think is still relevant we still celebrate the lives of those individuals here at michigan every june it did you know if there is any good news about that event it did two things one of one of which i think was um kind of more immediate and personal and that is it really made apparent to all of us here and i think in the broader transplant community how precious you know the each member of our team is and how important their contributions are and how much they put at stake to make these incredible you know events of organ transplants happen the second thing is it made our field pause and figure out you know do we need to be doing things differently you know do we need to be shipping teams all over the country to procure organs when there are qualified surgeons you know right next to where that that organ may have come from do we need to reconsider how we travel you know in terms of the the um the expertise of the flight teams and such and the and the actual flight uh um planes themselves um and it's and it has motivated differences for example in the liver community now we used to fly out every time there was an organ to to get you know we would go to wherever that toner hospital is now more than 50 of the time you know one of our colleagues at another center procures that organ for us and ships it to us which which is the way that it should be i mean i think if you were a lay person looking at the system you're like wait a minute why are you shipping teams a lot of the stuff when you have qualified people right there so it has motivated change in our community that that i think needs to continue to evolve but you're absolutely right that it it puts a um it's a it was a terrible event to remind us uh of the kind of sanctity and importance of our teams for sure well chris i want to thank you for for for sharing that story um it's hard to believe it was 13 and a half years ago i i mean i remember like it was yesterday so i can't imagine how proximate it feels to you as well um this has been wonderful to sit down with you and talk about this um i i always enjoy um our times together and i have the fondest memories of sitting in that empty cafeteria two in the morning between traumas and again as long as i was sitting there with you it was always enjoyable it was never like i can't wait to get back to the call room and try to get 10 minutes of sleep it was like i'd rather be sitting here with chris absorbing his wisdom even if it means getting no sleep tonight so um that wisdom continues and i know that you're um you're surrounded by patients that are i i hope they realize how lucky they are to have you as their dog i'm sure they do now you're very generous peter and i just want to say how grateful i am for you inviting me i also really am grateful for you using your platform to to highlight the importance of uh organ donation and the the miracle really that it is that that transplantation works and so i'm i'm grateful for the opportunity and most of all just to see you and reminisce a little bit so thank you
