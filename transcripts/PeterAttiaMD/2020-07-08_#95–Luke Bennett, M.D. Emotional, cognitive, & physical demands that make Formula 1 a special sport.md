Original release date: 3/2/20

In this episode, Luke Bennett, Medical and Sports Performance Director for Hintsa Performance, explains the ins and outs of Formula 1 with a focus on the behind-the-scenes human element, and what makes it so emotionally, cognitively, and physically demanding for the drivers as well as the many team members. Luke first talks about his fascinating background with the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia which lead to his current position with Hintsa working closely with F1 drivers to improve their health and performance despite jet-lag and sleep constraints due to an unrivaled travel schedule. Luke also sheds light on the underappreciated level of sheer physical strength and endurance it takes to drive an F1 car combined with the extreme cognitive aptitude, spatial awareness, and ability to navigate a socially complex environment that is needed to be successful as a driver. Additionally, Luke gives an overview of how the F1 season and races work, the incredible advances in car technology and safety measures, and what Luke and Hintsa hope to bring in the near future to the unique and special sport that is Formula 1.

We discuss:
-What it’s like to be a “flying doctor” in Australia, and how Luke ended up working in Formula 1 with Hintsa [3:10];
-Behind the scenes of Formula 1—crazy travel, jet lag, massive teams, and fascinating human storylines [10:45];
-The incredible physical strength and cognitive aptitude needed to be a F1 driver [19:00];

[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode I guess this week is dr. Luke Bennett Luke is the medical and sports performance director for Hin set performance a company focused on human well-being and athletic performance with a particular emphasis in motorsport Luke received his medical degree as well as his master's degree in sports medicine at the University of

[00:01:08] Queensland he then spent seven years training in intensive care before working for six years in remote emergency aeromedical retrieval with the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Western Australia something that we actually talk about in this episode that despite knowing Luke I didn't know this about him and didn't understand what that meant I wanted to interview Luke because

[00:01:30] I talked a lot about my interest in Formula one my passion for it and I realized that a lot of people who listen to this podcast might not fully understand why and I thought that no one could do a better job explaining some of the ins and outs of it the way Luke could and he does a really great job of that again you can come into this without having ever watched a Formula

[00:01:55] One race or finding any interest in it and I think you're gonna come away from this thinking wow you learned a lot and you have a greater appreciation for the sport of Formula one what makes it special why it's so emotionally cognitively and physically appealing we talk a lot about Luke's background we do again an overview of f1 and the races the driving the unbelievable travel and physical and logistics and sleep constraints and everything that are placed on all of the drivers and the teams we decided to release this episode specifically to coincide with the release of season two of the Netflix documentary series Formula One drive to survive which just came out on February 28th and if you haven't seen season one of that I recommend going and watching that first I think I binge watched it in two days when it came out can't recommend this series enough does a really good job of showing you not just the drama of what happens on the tracks but perhaps more importantly the drama of what happens off the circuit my hope is that if you're not a fan of f1 this will give you a great overview of the sport why I love it so much and if you're already a fan you're definitely going to enjoy this so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr. Luke Luke it's so good to see you man thanks Peter back in Austin huh yeah and thank you for making time we had spent a couple of weeks trying to figure out how we were gonna make this happen with your schedule because obviously you have more important things to do than sit here and goof off with me so I really appreciate you making time that's why we're doing this so late at night no problem we got the races the other way around this year with Mexico in Austin so we we actually had a free day beforehand worked out well so let's start with the most interesting thing on your CV and we're gonna get to a lot of things that you do but tell me what a

[00:03:45] Flying Doctor is the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia is pretty unique I don't think there's anything like it anywhere else in the world even considering the continent of Africa Western Australia in particular is a state that's about the same size as Western Europe it has only two million people by way of population and only really one and one of those is I mean most of them are in Perth right exactly so all of the clinical services essentially are in Perth and it's actually more economical for the health system to fund an aeromedical retrieval service by fixed-wing aircraft for the entire state rather than building and funding hospitals around so it's this huge expanse with a vibrant sort of mining industry in particular of underprivileged indigenous communities big tourist industry during the winter months and all sorts of crazy action happening out there and a couple of these flying doctor bases where you'd have a crew of a doctor a nurse and a pilot flying to retrieve patients and then taking them to the capital city so regardless of the problem you were usually at best three or four hours from help but more often than not up north half a day to a day away from tertiary specialist care and some really really sick patients on a daily or weekly basis so when you take something like childbirth for example where there was at least some anticipation of when a person's going to need medical care do those patients just sort of come to

[00:05:09] Perth or as childbirth something that would be done locally there's often a plan to fly the patients to Perth and also there's high rates of unexpected premature labor so we spent a lot of time actually on obstetrics which terrified me to be honest so it came from adult intensive care medicine and learning obstetrics and pediatrics on the fly like that was sometimes a pretty nervous situation so if somebody suffers a motor vehicle accident or a heavy machinery accident in the field the first responders could take how many hours to get there so first of all when

[00:05:39] I started the first responders were often volunteer ambulance crew so it might be the local teacher or the local shopkeeper going out to do the first response they can be easily three hours each way drive back to the nearest small Hospital and there's even parts of the state where we would land on the road on the highway because it was the fastest way of retrieving the patient now that was pretty uncommon but typically patients have had a pretty good trial of life by the time we got to them who was minimum three to four hours after the insult Wow so there's just things we take for granted as far as I mean do they have

[00:06:12] IEDs locally and things like that for people who are having heart attacks yeah so there's reasonable basic resuscitation equipment in these small nursing posts a lot of really nurse led clinics around the place and these nurses were unbelievable you know the stress they must face on a daily basis having to deal with whatever comes in the door good resuscitation facilities were there but its case of getting the patient to them and then the appropriate and medical skills to them as well now you're from the other coast you're from the east coast of Australia yeah I grew up in Brisbane and live more recently on the Sunshine Coast beautiful place called noosa heads so what took you out to Perth did you train there I did not the Flying Doctor job was something that had interested me and in fact the Western Australian division had a lot more of this primary retrieval work which was far more interesting than routine shuttling of patients between regional hospitals which is more the case on the East Coast so it was really the nature of the work that tracted me to waa and it's a beautiful part of the world in this amazing remote desert and coastal scenery up there and it was just a new adventure and something that I look back on is probably the most professionally satisfying part of my career clinically so far so what was the transition from that which I sang sounds like it came out of critical care big

[00:07:27] Hospital critical care to that too what you're doing today with hence ax which we'll talk about what of course what that is throughout my time working in hospital intensive care and then in the flying doctors I was essentially volunteering to work trackside doing trauma and rescue for different motorsport events so we worked at the

[00:07:46] Australian Grand Prix for about 11 years in Melbourne the Australian team did the Korean race when it was there for a couple of years and then I also did a lot of rally and off-road and that stuff was a lot of fun and very interesting medicine wise you had long response times you typically had two injured patients you had to do your own extrication and fire suppression and the patients were generally more heavily injured than in circuit racing so that was the overlap in terms of Korea during that phase and then at the Australian

[00:08:17] Grand Prix a I met a guy called Adam Costanza who was Lewis Hamilton's first physio he was an Australian guy who'd been to University in my sister's year group and so we got talking one year and I met his boss and our founder dr. Aki Hin so who became discussed but had perhaps and kept in touch with them over subsequent years to the point where he was eventually looking to step back from travel and I was in the right place at the right time to take the role that we're in now and when was that 2014 was my first year so just coming up to the end of my sixth full season in Formula

[00:08:47] One tell me a little bit about Aki and his philosophy of training so dr. Aki Hensel was a finished trauma surgeon he was actually doing humanitarian work in Ethiopia in the mid 90s and he was thinking about human wellbeing through a humanitarian sort of lens but met Hallie gabru Selassie and those legendary

[00:09:08] Ethiopian Olympic runners during his time there and and translated some of those principles into the needs of an athlete when he moved back to Finland Mika häkkinen asked him to start to support him and his family trackside and Meeker won a couple of World Championships side-by-side with a key in 9899 he became sort of the McLaren team doctor and and then famously had long associations with Lewis Hamilton and

[00:09:33] Kimi räikkönen and Sebastien and other young drivers as they came through and a key unfortunately died a couple of years ago but he attained this guru like status in the paddock he was a really kind and inspirational figure a great doctor and a real father figure to many of the drivers that we see doing so well today and how did he overlap with Sid and the role that Sid played beginning probably in the 70s right yeah so professor Watkins was appointed and employed by the FIA so the governing body of the sport Sid was doing all of the trackside rescue he was in the medical care which chases the first lap of the race and in those days he was kind of the only doctor around through the 70s and the 80s and I guess as the 90s wore on there was a little bit more of a trend towards teams having some of their own doctors which is what Aki was so I don't think Sid overlapped directly with Aki there was a gentleman called

[00:10:26] Gary heart Stein who followed Sid and did a great job they said retired word in the late 90s that's correct yeah it was the mid to late nineties yeah and he was around at FIA conferences and things for a number of years I made him a couple of times but a guy who really established trackside medical care from nothing in the in the 1970s and a number of drivers probably owe their lives and their health to Sid and his successors I was recently rereading Damon Hill's biography and it's sort of interesting to go back to even 25 years ago and think about how dangerous that sport was and it went through sort of these step functions of improvement and safety sort of in the in the mid 70s there was a big step up and then there wouldn't really be another huge step forward until the mid 90s after Senna's death and even just two years later you see how in just a span of a couple of years this port got considerably safer which is something

[00:11:17] I'd love to dive into with you so let's talk a little bit about f1 because for many people listening to this they probably don't understand so many dimensions of it starting with the way I describe it to my friends who don't follow it it's like having a Super Bowl every two weeks that's the only way I can explain it to people who don't pay attention to Formula One which not a lot of Americans do is would you agree with that assessment yeah it's the world's most interesting an expensive circus really it's endlessly fascinating on the social level on the human level and I'm not sure if you saw there was a Netflix series which came out based on last season the one I've only watched each episode 14 times so I have no idea what you're talking about my family knows every episode off a heart and then actually they keep calling for more and more I heard there's gonna be another season they are filming this year as well but you wouldn't be surprised to learn that many of my friends and families and particularly female family members and friends people who've never had more than a passing interest in motorsport have suddenly seen this series and understood the human story that's unfolding all through the midfield and the teams and the politics and the appreciation that you can have not just the on-track action but the human stories that are going on behind the scenes is phenomenal in terms of a comparison to Super Bowl I mean it is a massive television event it's outside of probably Summer Olympics and football World Cup it's got if not the largest TV audience of annually recurring event it's certainly up there in the top three it's not uncommon for 200,000 people to 300,000 people to show up at every race throughout the course of the weekend correct yeah I think we had 360 odd thousand attendance over three days in

[00:12:56] Mexico last week for example some races are better attended than others the TV audiences there regardless and we've got new owners of the sport a couple of years ago so they're modernizing a lot of the approaches to digital coverage as well which is starting to get some traction and this year there are 20 races 21 races we won and next year 22 and possibly 23 or 24 the so we're probably gonna hit a ceiling there somewhere of what these human beings involved in working the sport can take there's a lot of discussion about how the teams will approach for example a 24 race season because there's a lot of travel it's a great life it's a great privilege to work in Formula One but it's very very hard on particularly mechanics engineers catering staff people with families at home there's a limit to how much you can sustain being away and the teams are going to be budget capped in 2021 at the same time as they're going to have this interesting problem of perhaps rotating staff so it's never a dull moment things are changing all the time one of the things that first intrigued me when I really started to think about this through the lens of human performance was the management of jet lag walk me through what a typical travel schedule would look like especially when they're on the one-week pace which is quite common maybe just stepping back and thinking about the structure of the

[00:14:14] Formula One calendar so we have these twenty erases and they're organized in absolutely no logical geographical order the racers pay to be the first of the last race of the season they pay to be on a traditional fixed date they might be aligned with a particular public holiday or a school holiday block and that's always the priority over any sort of travel planning logic so we start the season with four races which are long-haul mostly in Australia and Asia going to be five races next year when the Vietnamese Grand Prix starts we then have a slightly nicer period sort of through the European summer where we are on the road working out of trucks in

[00:14:53] Europe a little bit less flying and then we're in this phase now which is the hardest part of the year so seven or eight long-haul flyaway races again back and forth to Asia a couple of times Russia three races in the Americas now and then finishing in the Middle East and again most personnel will go back to

[00:15:12] Europe in between each of those races so most people have done a dozen long-haul into continental sectors over the last month or so and this is the time when championships are being won or lost and it's in terms of sleep management I listened to your Q&A with Matthew Walker a couple of days ago and there's an ideal to sleep management which we really try to adhere to as much as possible but there's a really pragmatic element to that as well and particularly around the psychology of arriving at an event and this is not as much the drivers but the crews the mechanics and the engineers people who probably have a very narrow window to either get on to the new time zone or not and if they get to a point where there's been two or three nights of disrupted sleep getting into the phase of the week where the cars are on track it can be actually a quite a disturbing thing so we try not to use sleep aids sleeping medications too much but there is probably a case where athletes and others around them need to perform for just having that one night reset with a sleeping pill on arrival in the new location as much as that's kind of the lesser of two evils it can improve somebody's outlook and mindset for the rest of the weekend to come we do quite detailed sleep and jetlag planning for the drivers and on occasion for the teams as well but the reality of the schedule the weekend schedule the flights that can be chosen there's a limited number of flights to take a thousand people into each destination with limited flexibility so it's a case of being very pragmatic not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good and things just move so fast you have to just keep getting through each day the best way you can I think a number of people watching Formula One casually might not appreciate the magnitude of the team that supports the two drivers so again let's start at the top of the food chain with the two biggest teams Mercedes and Ferrari 10 teams correct 20 drivers so two per team how big is the entirety of the Mercedes team or the Ferrari team so you're looking at probably between nine hundred and a thousand people at the Mercedes

[00:17:14] Formula One factory for example Ferrari would be very similar and then again in the Mercedes case you've got another six or eight hundred just building the engines in a separate facility a separate company so probably looking at an average of a thousand people per car up and down the ten teams and again that's going to be challenged soon when there's a budget cap and there's going to have to be a lot more rationalization and prioritization of how teams approach building the fastest car possible well that budget cap apply for example you have some teams that aren't building their own engine

[00:17:47] Mercedes is building the engine and the their team is buying the engine from Mercedes will that cap still apply the same to those teams it seems a bit unfair so this hasn't been announced yet I think the final regulations are due to drop any week now but these are precisely the topics that have been so controversial a car manufacturer under a budget cap faces a completely different scenario - one of the traditional privateer teams like Williams or McLaren so very precisely those reasons it's not resolved yet and I suspect the regulations will continue to evolve over the next couple of years now of those people how many are actually travelling to support the drivers and actually be at the race versus stay in the factory so there's a core race team of about 43 people with a specific pass which is all electronically regulated in terms of the times they can be at the circuit so those 43 people are operational they're allowed to touch the car and interact with the race event itself at a typical large event like Monaco or

[00:18:45] Austin the traveling staff might be something around 150 per team where there's a huge marketing and communications and media apparatus that goes along with the team's activities for that week there's a core bunch of engineers of course and a catering team and the truck logistics guys because they all are guys at the moment and those teams are pretty constant but they'll vary for example a European versus a long-haul flyaway race yesterday I was in the car with my daughter coming back from a cross-country meet and we were on the freeway and driving 75 miles an hour which feels like nothing when you're just driving in a straight line and I said Olivia do you realize that those cars we watch every Sunday can go three times this fast in a straight line it was fast enough that she sort of got what that felt like and then I tried to explain to her the difference in g-forces that we feel when I would brake really hard for her to feel a hard brake or turn relatively quickly it's very hard I think for people who haven't been inside a racecar to even try to extrapolate what's happening in Formula

[00:19:50] One I was actually trying to reflect as I was having discussion with her about the greatest g-forces I felt inside of race cars that I've been driving nothing like what those guys experienced no maybe - gee 1.9 2.1 g what type of forces do drivers experience in f1 today so we're between five and six G on some of the fastest very high speed constant radius corners like the final tournament for example a couple of verses weekly turns as well so means your head your four kilo head plus helmet is four or five or six times its normal weight and you've got to resist that with your neck muscles so it's an extremely physical activity and I had a ride in there's a two seater f1 car which is used at some corporate events I did some laps of Mexico as a passenger last year and who got to drive two of the X Minardi drivers with the greatest names ever in the history of Formula one we had

[00:20:43] Patrick free seconds alt Baumgartner was also there helping yeah so I honestly couldn't have done five or six laps as a passenger the forces and the experience was so brutal and now guys a it's probably equivalent to doing a pretty intense CrossFit circuit for two hours with a maximum of five or ten second breaks around it while someone else is doing crossfit trying to push you out of the way off your equipment and someone's in your ear asking you to solve maths equations and there's two or three hundred million people watching and maybe you don't have a contract for next year either that you sort of thinking about at the back you might so there's an enormous amount going on while the driver has to hit that millimeter perfect apex every lap and it all just happens so fast it's a lot more instinctive I think than people think especially when the drivers are in traffic but very very physical yeah I think I'm probably more empathetic to the mistakes that drivers make what race was it when sub came back on track without looking left stroll almost hit us and then stroll did the exact same thing 30 seconds later so the Italian

[00:21:50] Grand Prix a couple of months yeah that was that was that's right as Monza so I gotta tell you people were up in arms and oh he should know better he's a four-time world champion my view is in the heat of the moment I don't even understand how people can be critical I mean I guess that's the nature of what we do as spectators and you can't see it no that's the other thing the cockpits are so high now yeah and you can turn your head only a couple of degrees in each direction the mirrors give you a little bit of you than the halo which we'll discuss and does restrict a lot of vision as well and it's a difficult problem the drivers can see sort of the top of their tires they can't see most of the extremities of the car so those front wings hang out a long way and they're very susceptible to damage so it's almost unfathomable the way they can race in close quarters literally millimetre perfect sweeping the front we have one car across and missing the tires of their colleague

[00:22:42] Neil that's crazy it never gets old to me when I'm trying to show someone what type of precision and proprioception is necessary because when we think of athletes having proprioception I mean that's one of the hallmarks of all great athletes they sort of always know where they are in space but driving takes it to another level because it's not just where you are in space is where this car is in space and I mean because I'm biased of course watching Senna on board laps in Monaco I mean I could do that all day long because you realize he's coming within three to six inches of curbs of walls lap after lap after lap at speeds that are sort of dizzying yeah changing gears manually no power steering yeah incredible footage all that stuff but you touch on an interesting point in there Peter

[00:23:30] I think this proprioceptive aptitude is something that really separates the great drivers from the good and as someone who thinks about driver performance I haven't worked out how we could even study this let alone modify it but the way a driver senses what's going on in the adhesion between their car and the track the fine movements of a car they sense it's sort of through their back through their legs through the contact that they have with the seat and I think the truly great drivers just have this unbelievable level of truncal proprioception and sensory awareness that allows them to feel what the car is doing and I think perhaps if there's ever way that we can measure and train that it might lead to some step forward in driver skills training well that's a great point I mean I think anybody who's been in a simulator will tell you that's true I mean I have a simulator at home and I know it's so much harder to catch oversteer in the simulator because you don't have that feeling of oversteer that comes before your visual change whereas understeer is all visual anyway so you the simulator seems great for helping you correct that but that to me just says exactly what you're saying which is when you deprive somebody of the ability to sense that in their trunk in their but there's that scene in Rush when the character playing niki lauda talks about how he was gifted with a great ass and that's how he sort of knew that this tyre was a little bit low in pressure but I think that stuff's all true and I just think that the great ones they feel something now of course the more in question is the one you posed which was how would you train that most great drivers come from a karting background off the top of your head there were any of the 20 guys on the grid now not from a karting background no everybody would have started in karting yeah they've taken different paths through formula for

[00:25:22] Formula 3 and different ways to the top but everybody starts out karting yeah karting is thought to be probably the best training that a Formula One driver can do there's very limited testing nowadays so if a driver does want to train skills then karting is typically the go-to activity why do you think that is over for example being in a simulator is it because you still get the feeling of the experience you still have to manage the slide and all those things yeah it's a very raw experience it probably comes back to the very stripped out basics of feeling tired he Jie and car control and car movement in a very accessible way going and running our Formula One car of any recent era on a track is not a trivial exercise it probably takes a team of at least 20 people just to get the thing fired up so but karting is yeah that pure technical skills exercise that's still worthwhile doing I know I sure enjoy it anytime I can take my daughter karting I'm like this is the greatest thing in the world there is no greater smile on your face than when you're sliding around on your side on those things so you alluded to the complexity of the cars today give people a sense of that you also talked a moment ago about how one of the in addition to doing the CrossFit thing and getting screamed at in blah blah blah you've got an engineer talking to you when we're watching television we hear a fraction of that discussion between the driver and his engineer how much is actually going on and what are the sorts of things that a driver is actually being expected to manage so there's a number of layers to that on the team level there's probably 10 or 20 different radio networks involving all of the key personnel so from the team boss to the strategist to be chief engineer to the individual driver engineers there's also a huge infrastructure back in the factory in the UK and they might be looking at the radio messages from other vehicles they might be looking at all sorts of telemetry from the car there's hundreds and hundreds of streams of data which sort of ultimately have to feed through this one person which is the individual drivers race engineer so it can get pretty busy on the radios and the art of being a race engineer is probably being able to not only understand and manage your driver emotionally but to filter that information and deliver it in a way that's concise and useful a related question I guess is what is the driver doing around a lap and there are limitations on what the car is allowed to do I mean just for a perspective when

[00:27:46] I'm in a car and my coach is talking to me there are only certain parts of a circuit when I can even talk back I have to be on a straightaway to even just have the presence of mind to push the radio button and say got it okay will do yep noted next lap I'll hit that apex a little different I can't do that when

[00:28:08] I'm cornering yeah for sure and in the ideal world there are structures to the radio that occur at a certain point around a lap but there are times when you don't have that luxury and you reference sort of button pushing but the modern Formula One steering wheel is an unbelievable piece of complexity in its own right I mean these steering wheels are worth 50 or 60,000 pounds each and there's probably 20 or 25 buttons on there all of which have sub menus and sometimes sub sub menus and the drivers by regulation have to drive the car themselves they can only be given a limited amount of instruction from the pit wall as to what settings to use and it's go to the point now where there more or less changing the settings of the car between each corner so that it's optimized for each particular corner so the really great drivers not only have this purple receptive feel they've got a bandwidth excess where they can really tune into the car they can make all these changes fairly automatically around a lap they have just the experience and the knowledge to understand how the car is going to work and then on top of that they have enough cognitive capacity left over to sort of sit above the race to understand what their competitors are doing what is the context of their pit stop strategy and when they need to push when they need to conserve tires so it's really an incredible cognitive load and that's a big part of what we are managing with our coaching staff across a race weekend give me an example of some of the complexities that can be managed corner-to-corner by the driver things like bright bias deep settings and then these modern engines absolutely incredible hybrid pieces of uh the hybrid electric engines tell folks what that means so we had the last reg change so these came in in 2014-2015 ok yeah so prior to that we were talking a pure naturally aspirated was it a v10 26 liter v6 yeah the v10 is were the good old days some time ago now but these are electric hybrid engines so they have a couple of different methods of energy recovery there's braking energy recovered from the vehicle there's heat energy from the turbocharger and these are fed back through a battery - and probably about a quarter or a third of the engines power comes from this recovered electrical energy but to reference your previous question so deploying that energy in the most appropriate way around a lap is an enormous part of driving a current f1 car and saving energy for a period where you might be trying to defend from an overtake but deploy it in the parts of the lap where it's going to give you the maximum benefit in terms of lap time is just a massive engineering puzzle in itself which the drivers have to keep on top of so the engines themselves I mean this is incredible the internal combustion engine was invented water in the late eighteen hundreds early 1900s and for the entire history of the engine to 2014 the thermal efficiency went from maybe 20 25 percent to 28 or 30 percent at the very best scenario but since 2015 Formula One has taken that efficiency from about 28 29 percent to over 50 percent now so just a massive quantum leap in the way engines work and for all of its faults in terms of carbon footprint flying this great circus around the world and racing cars when you multiply that kind of engine technology by 80 million new cars sold around the world each year you can see that there is a case we made that

[00:31:35] Formula One does a lot of good as well in developing these technologies I think it does good on two main fronts that being one of them and of course auto safety being another one let's go back a little bit to the efficiency how long do you think it takes for those types of benefits to trickle in certainly it trickles to the very high-end halo super cars quite quickly within a couple of years but I think if you look at some of the technology that's coming in to your average medium family sedan nowadays it's probably reasonable say within 10 or 15 years a meaningful amount of this stuff becomes relatively standard and I guess it depends on regulatory pressures in in different jurisdictions around the world but the technology is there if governments mandate the use of it I suppose and we'll see I guess where we are on this planet over the next decade or so we're gonna see a lot more emphasis on these technologies I want to come back to safety in a moment but I can't help but ask a question that actually I mean I've thought about in the past but I still don't really understand all of the complexity you've discussed it's mind-boggling I know that if I spent the rest of my life I could never drive one of those cars I could do goofy sedan laps but I could never do a real lap let alone a race with anyone else

[00:32:46] I might have trouble just driving it out of the garage eventually but not easy and yet the drivers are getting younger and younger sometimes again I'm sitting there we always watch the races together every Sunday and because we're in California we actually like watching them in real time so we do get up at 5:00 to watch them first thing in the morning whatever and I'm trying to explain to my daughter in particular because she's old enough how old norris is and Leclaire an even versed app and like I'm like these guys are really young and there was a day when a 30 year old was in his prime a 30 year old is not in his prime in this sport anymore and certainly by the time your yeah a 30 year old couldn't break into the sport put it that way whereas Damon Hill was 30 in effectively his rookie year 29 perhaps but how is it that these drivers are getting younger and younger as the complexity of these cars is getting greater and greater I'm just blown away by it I think there's a couple of dimensions to that one of them is purely cultural I think people just didn't think you could be a Formula One driver at all before the age of 23 or 24 previously I think maybe some of that complexity plays into a gaming culture a lot of our younger drivers do a lot of gaming and it's kind of a bit of a cliche to make the comparison but I think there probably is an element to that but I think now that it's been done we had an extra step and come into the sport just out of his 16th year I think and we've had a couple of teenage drivers since then land stroke esteban o'connor and others i think now that it's accepted that it's possible the teams are more open to looking at younger talent I think the pathway to

[00:34:27] Formula One previously let's think about the 90s or the early 2000s when we did have these brutal v10 engines and the cars were physically very much harder to drive I think there was a physicality about that that probably suited a slightly older driver as well the cars are not easy to drive nowadays by any means but they are probably less of that brutal raw explosive muscular power required for perhaps a more an individual more well developed physically and it remains to be seen of course but does this mean that Formula

[00:34:58] One drivers will have longer careers today coming in earlier and staying longer or does it mean that the turnover is going to be higher and it's sort of interesting when you consider like I always think of Luis is really young I don't know 2007 seems like it was sort of yesterday and yet Luis is what 34 yeah Luis and Sebastien of both 33 32 33 now which would make them two of the oldest guys in the grid right now we had

[00:35:23] Kimi turned 40 yes wait but he's without most yeah I think there's an opposing sort of trend though the seat time is so valuable now there's so little testing it's relatively difficult to get a super license which is the qualification you need to collect points in other series you need to do well in other series just to get to formula one so and then on top of that the cars are just so complicated to drive that there's a huge premium placed on anyone with seat time and C experience so I think that will trend very strongly towards longer careers so people come in early and they'll be retained for longer you'll have to have a much stronger case to bring an unproven rookie into the sport let's take a step back a little bit and kind of talk about some of these changes that have really taken over you've alluded to the halo explain what the halo is when it came about and what the effect of that has been so the halo is a cage-like device which sort of sits over the top of the driver's cockpit so I'm just going back to basics we're talking about open cockpit racing here and that's one of the classic characteristics of a formula car it's got open wheels and an open cockpit and traditionally you could see the driver the halo is this device which has been constructed over the top to protect the head of the driver which was the one last remaining big vulnerability in terms of safety and the halos been in for two seasons now I must submit personally I was a little skeptical I I could understand the rationale for I did wonder whether it was a solution in search of a problem having said that we've had probably at least four distinct incidents now in

[00:36:59] Formula One in Formula two weather halo has prevented a significant impact with the drivers head so regardless of what anyone thinks of it now it's here to stay the current halo is not a pretty thing it's definitely probably in its first iteration at present and it will be developed I think in IndyCar this year they're using an evolution of the halo which has more of a jet fighter screen around it which is much much more aesthetically pleasing and I think instead of that bar down the middle correct and I think when things like fogging and airflow and you have to account for all weather conditions and all visibility conditions and when those problems can be solved probably will move towards a Aero screen with a putting out the top so that it's still technically open wheel racing and it's a pretty impressive piece of kid I mean it's seven kilos of titanium the test the halo apparatus has to pass by FAA regulation is something like a 10 to 12 tonne load a large bus being sat on the top of this seven kilo device and not deforming at all just again another example that's unbelievable remarkable technologies that go into these beautiful works of art these cars that we can sometimes take for granted and there's another thing that we wear in a car called the Hans which it's been around almost exactly 20 years now it's been in Formula one a little bit less than that maybe 15 years we've indirectly alluded to it by explaining why the driver can't turn his or her head well in Formula One his head I guess but left to right what does the

[00:38:30] Hans doing and how is it saving a life so the Hans is a head and neck support device Hans is actually one of several brands that are on the market but it's the one used most commonly in open-wheel series it's a carbon fiber device that sits on the top of the shoulders of the driver it has the race harness the seatbelt straps over the top of the device pressing it down into the drivers shoulders and then the helmet is attached by some very high tensile straps to this device the effect of that is that if the driver has a head on or a rotational impact the movement of the head especially the flexion of the neck is greatly limited and the Hans device has no doubt and across many categories of motor sport and save many many drivers from high cervical fractures so fractures of the neck that would have killed them or severely disabled them for their life it's interesting we probably only have anecdote about this and don't get me wrong I think that the

[00:39:29] Hans and and other devices like it have been an innovation in motorsport that shouldn't be questioned at all but the forced transmission down the spine is interesting to think about and I think if you look at a lot of the accidents we get in rally nowadays and also in close racing we seem to get these thoracic and lumbar crush factors a lot more commonly and I don't think this has been formally studied but it seems like the hands probably changes the loading on the spine and produces something that's transmitted more axially down to other parts of the spine do you think that's something that they experience when they hit a bump or is it more when there's a head-on collision it would be more in a very high speed impact where the loadings on a driver and an impact like that vary with the exact circumstances I mean it totally makes sense because if there's a vector that's going forward and that normally would have been distributed between c1 and c3 and now you've locked that up with the

[00:40:24] Hans well then you're gonna see that presumably below about t1 the force has to go somewhere I think the thoracic spine is braced somewhat by rib structures and the drivers in their cars are in a highly recumbent position they're almost lying flat on their backs and which a lot of people don't appreciate and that also adds to the unbelievable skill required to just control one of these vehicles the fact that you're more or less lying flat on your back with limited visibility so that changes the force distribution as well you know it was in

[00:40:54] Italy last year and I got the chance for my wife to see a Formula One car and get inside one and she's like what five seven or something like that and I'm like okay so a Formula One driver might be a total of an inch taller than you two inches taller than you get in there and now try to imagine doing what they're doing from the position and she couldn't believe how little she could see from being in this position it was just it is overwhelming the modern f1 car is very long and very wide and very heavy as well and controlling those cars with limited visibility in traffic is a very underappreciated part of the art I think it's the hardest I mean there's nothing I've ever dabbled in that I could extrapolate to and say that's harder I just don't think anything is people say oh you've swum from here to here or something and I'm like that is a trivial trivial task that is simply a matter of just putting your head down and trying harder that doesn't speak to what you're describing here it's a sport with many complex layers and a lot of that social complexity - yeah how do you manage I mean is that part of your job description or is that just something that based on your own personality you're obviously very thoughtful you're very introspective that you've sort of gravitated to which is you have the luxury of not being you have the luxury of being sort of there to serve everyone but you have huge personalities you have a sport with only twenty athletes but ten owners and they all have to be under one roof effectively 21 times a year yeah first of all like yes with reference to our position we're extremely privileged to be working across multiple teams how many teams do you work with other ten we work with at least one driver in every team at present so about 14 drivers in some former under our care I never take that for granted it's an enormous privilege and it goes back to Aki's time really when the model we use is is medically led and the medical services that we provide I think a kind of the glue that cement those relationships and I would say so our model is that we have a performance coach people would refer to as the trainer or the physio who accompanies each driver this coach will attend all of the races and normally train with the driver in between races as well all year so they have a very close one on one relationship we tend to use mostly sports scientists in our team they have a good broad understanding of the physical preparation the nutrition the sleep management and the other things that we need to think about across the race season we do use some physiotherapy stuff as well and increasingly dual qualified sport scientists physios are probably the ideal for this job but all of that specific preparation aside probably the most important role for our coaches is management of the cognitive bandwidth of the driver across a race weekend so we discussed driving the car and the drivers will have about seven hours in the vehicle across a race weekend but on top of that there's probably ten hours of engineering meetings in which they get very very deep in the data and analysis of what's happened on track and then endless other hours of media and marketing commitments as well as just all managing the politics of any athlete's career so as you referenced you might think about the NBL and a sorry or the NFL where most weeks you're gonna have two team bosses under one roof at any one time but in Formula One every two weeks you have 100% of the competitors in the world all twenty seats they're all there you've got all the team principals you've got a good percentage of the team owners you've also got the principle regulators of the sport and the owners and promoters and all of those people are mingling freely with the media you know there's nowhere to hide in the

[00:44:41] Formula One tank it's a it's a big traveling family so that does out a certain level of political I wouldn't say tension that's probably pejorative or negative but it does add a real social complexity to what these athletes need to get out and do which is ultimately drive the car and our coaches get to know their drivers they manage a lot of their key relationships they manage the time of the driver they will usually develop a role where they can sort of interface between the marketing team and the media commitments and things and certainly recognize when that driver needs to be left alone where they may need a holiday when they can push when they can train when they can do more or less so that's probably and these drivers are all human beings people think of professional sport and especially Formula one that's a place where everything is done with an unlimited budget to absolute perfection and I think Peter you probably have contact with enough professional athletes in various categories to understand that it's just not like that is it regardless of the funding regardless of the techniques and the science than the innovation available professional sport is just about human beings and all their flaws and faults well yeah I probably don't have nearly as much experience as you but I think what's most interesting to me is that even the people who are the best most of them still have the same sorts of doubts that quote unquote normal person would experience and you see it across seasons where people get into slumps and you get a bad bounce you get things that just don't go your way for a period of time and all of a sudden it sort of shakes your confidence and I don't know I mean

[00:46:19] I think in a sport like Formula one I would have to guess that the toll of that is really great there is nowhere to hide it's like tennis there's no ambiguity about who's driving that car or who's on that side of the tennis court that side of the tennis court and yes there are plenty of examples when a driver is doing everything right in the car fails certainly Seb a couple of weeks ago best line of the whole Formula One season by the way can bring back the bleep in f12 v12 other I just have like I said earlier I think I just have great empathy for the load that they must be under and yeah you can say well look come on they're athletes they're doing something really fun in there it's really great but I often wonder if it's as fun as we think it is compared to you know I'm always reminded of Senna at the very end of the documentary talking about how you let the sense that Formula

[00:47:10] One just wasn't as fun to him at that point in his life because he was harkening back to his days of karting he just kept saying like there was no politics there was no money it was just about the pure joy of racing and I I do wonder when you talk about some of those obligations that these guys have in the political games that they have to play and just the unhappiness you referenced the younger drivers coming through yeah there's a lot of satisfaction to be derived of course from working with world champions and winning championships but actually one of the joys of my job as well as bringing these young kids through and we typically start working with them in f3 or f2 and can you explain to folks the difference between f1 f2 f3 and what does that look like I mean we're gonna come back and talk about the recent events of f2 but help people understand what those different formula mean so this is being greatly simplified in the last couple of years to the credit of the FIA there's a more or less straight pathway through F 4 F 3 F 2 and then f1 nowadays formula 2 occurs at f1 race weekends so the drivers in f2 are very much on the radar of the Formula One teams and bosses they're a car which is maybe 5 to 10 seconds a lap slower than an f1 car a lot simpler in terms of the controls they're not these remarkable hybrid sort of engines they've got some similarities probably the most important element being the tires so tire management is incredibly important in Formula One and the drivers in f2 and to a lesser extent f3 have to learn that art in those categories if three cars are a little bit simpler again sort of no power steering a lot more physical or more brutal to drive but slower and typically how older the folks in F 3 and F 2 you're probably talking an age range of 16 to our li 20s these guys and girls playing for keeps every year could be the end of their driving career so I commend anyone who has a bit of time to watch the f2 racing it's genuinely exciting weekend week out and it's a big job for the stewards to keep on top of driving standards because you know so much is at stake in those categories and then if four is more or less the graduation point from karts to open wheel racing and national f4 championships in many different countries that sort of feed through to the higher categories so the cars get a little faster and a little more complex as you go each step up the chain what's the role of money as one goes up the chain when you look at a sport like basketball you referred to the NBA a moment ago if you're good if you live in the United States and you are really good you can make it to the NBA you don't need any money usually that'll take you through a college scholarship through to the NBA but if you're exceptional enough you could even go straight from high school into the pros same is true in baseball again you almost always go through the minor leagues you very rare you'd go straight from high school into the major leagues but you could go through college you could go from high school into a minor league baseball etc but Formula One's not quite like that which doesn't mean you have to come from wealth but you certainly have to get the endorsement of someone with a lot of money where does that begin in the chain so you take a really promising kid in a go-kart how do they get to Formula four three two and one so first of all I guess karting as a hobby and cutting starts at the age of six or seven or eight years old so it's not like strapping on running shoes or football boots you have to have a parent with a little bit of budget a little bit of interest in motorsport even to start karting typically motorsport can run within families so often there's a father usually as a father who's competed and and who has the funding to to bring a young competitor through and then I guess as you get good at motor racing there's two streams there's those who continue to pay their way and roll the dice and take their chances and and hope that their day will come and there's others who are really an obvious outrageous natural talent who will get picked up by one of the three or four big teams and inducted into a junior driver program so those opportunities are relatively scarce but if you're really good you'll probably find yourself aligned with one of the big teams that I know those aria graphically relevant are you more likely to get one of those streams if you're coming out of Europe and if you're coming out of South America I think

[00:51:31] Europe is absolutely the geographical center of the sport it's very difficult to succeed from Asia or from any of the Americas without ultimately ending up in 3rf - in Europe because that's simply where the racing is conducted under the noses of the f1 teams and that's where those top levels of category actually unfold so yeah and there's 20 seats in

[00:51:53] Formula One unlike tennis or golf or football where there's 100 or 200 or more competitors at the very highest level these drivers are competing for an extraordinarily small number of positions and everybody who's there regardless of how they've been funded is there on some kind of merit they've had to win championships or do well in junior categories just to get the super license points to be eligible to drive in f1 so I would posit that the depth that we see in the field currently is by far the best it's ever been and it's getting better every year and really adds to the stories all down through the midfield where some of the most interesting action unfolds it's not just about the Mercedes cars or the red ball cars in recent years dominating at the front of the field there's all sorts of fun to be had I think that's actually and I heard that this year for Netflix both Ferrari and Mercedes are being filmed is that true so the Netflix series has focused on the midfield where a lot of these stories are Mercedes have agreed to some limited involvement this year and I'm not sure actually what Ferrari is doing but I think they probably will feature to eliminate least that'll be great cuz I'd love to see it but I actually think last year worked out really well not having them in the story because you could have just talked about Ferrari and Mercedes the whole time but to talk about everybody but them made it incredibly interesting I agree it was one of the really powerful outcomes of the series and it's actually one of the hazards of work in the paddock at the moment trying to avoid the camera well I spent a lot of time talking to drivers about their health or their medical issues or the troubles that they're having in that career and it can be very easy to to be having a private conversation in a corner somewhere and suddenly find a Netflix boom microphone over your head or a camera for a distance to be fair that the team are relatively sensitive to that sort of thing and it's probably not just Netflix I mean we are performing our work in front of cameras day in day out the entire year and it's just something you've got to be a little bit mindful of how much you handicap the safety of Formula one today to put it in perspective in the 1960s and in the 1970s there was a very good chance that if you did this for a living you were not going to retire in fact it's kind of amazing the exceptions to that rule because they're the ones that we tend to know about today most people unless you're sort of a die-hard fan you've forgotten the names of all the people that died I think y'all can rent is the only one to have one a Formula One title posthumously so by definition if you're rattling off the names of Formula One champs they usually at least lived long enough to win many of them went on to die prematurely in retirement but the list of people that most people wouldn't remember like the Peter Rebbe sins of the world and I mean everybody remembers

[00:54:36] Jill Vilna who never won a title but it would still be considered one of the Great's of all time but there's this belief that Formula one today is so insanely safe to is not be interesting but one do you think that that's true and two can we learn anything about the recent fatality and formula two that can give us a sense that no actually it's still a very dangerous sport it's a really delicate argument because I think if we're honest with ourselves the danger there has to be a small element of danger at least to provide that depth of interest what the drivers are doing it has to be hard it has to be something that has to be something that we can't do yeah exactly so Formula One is extremely safe and we referenced all of the terrible things that happen in the 70s and early 80s but there's a number of strands that track design is getting much better than the car designers come on in leaps and bounds and the trackside intervention the medical and rescue services are also light years ahead of what they used to be but we have had three or four notable fatalities over the last two decades and so there is always some part of the

[00:55:42] Swiss cheese that lines up some unaccounted for possibility that can still result in a death and one of the big vulnerabilities is a side-on impact with a stationary vehicle and unfortunately we had a terrible accident about six or eight weeks ago at the Belgian Grand Prix in Formula 2 where a car who'd had a relatively innocuous in

[00:56:02] Antoine who bear was stranded sight on stationary in the middle of the track and was just hit at well over 200 kilometers an hour 170 miles per hour by one of his fellow competitors who was just uncited so we had this nose to side impact which as good as the f2 and the f1 cars are and believe me they've been very very good the intrusion properties of the chassis the Tubber exceptional but there are some forces that you just can't account for in every situation yeah I'll never forget the press conference a couple days after Senna died when Max Mosley then very new in his post as president said and I thought he was so spot-on by the way he said the question isn't why did Senna crash because that's all anybody wanted to talk about to this day there's still great debate about why he crashed so the question is why did he die and he said something I'm paraphrasing and he said it much more eloquently you were at the highest level of this sport at the absolute limit of mechanical and human capability there are going to be crashes all the time but nobody should die in one of these crashes I don't know if the statistics bear this out but it certainly seems like they do just watching races it doesn't seem like there are any fewer crashes today but there's no denying that the fatalities are an epsilon fraction of what they used to be and let's be honest the crashes are a massive part of the appeal of motorsport especially to the more casual fan it's spectacular in vehicle crashes and there's parts flying everywhere and it adds to the drama and the human tension as well so that will always be part of the sport but as you reference it needs to be made as safe as possible and you talked about the Senna footage driving around Monaco and one of the remarkable insights there is how high the drivers are sitting up out of the car and after

[00:57:58] Ayrton died that was one of the big innovations so the head in the shoulders of the driver were much better protected there's a shroud around the head and the helmet which limits any sort of intrusion and the cockpit sides are much higher nowadays Senna's death probably had a greater impact on the safety of f1 than any single tragedy in the history of this sport when Jim Clark died it's not like the sport changed that much and Jim

[00:58:24] Clark was to Formula One in the 60s almost I mean no one was quite to f1 what Senna was but comparable certainly there was an enormous amount of low-hanging fruit in terms of safety during that time so a lot of the simple things would know yeah I mean but they still drove unmarshal they still did mean I guess to this day I don't think anybody knows what actually happened to

[00:58:43] Clark's car yeah Senna's death was the first in a generation really there had not been a death apart from Roland Ratzenberger the previous day there had not been a death for 14 years and so it was a bit of a shock and so there was another step change in safety for sure the wheel tethers all sorts of things you recall wasn't even 10 years ago when

[00:59:02] Mark Webber had that unbelievable crash you know what I'm talking about I'd say yeah yeah and to see the wheels not coming off was sort of unbelievable yeah and he walked away went back and did his TV interviews yeah it's very hard to injure yourself in a Formula One car I had a look at this in a couple of years ago now but just the accident patterns in Formula One and it was interesting I define a medical incident as anytime a driver was reviewed and assessed at the track medical center either because they had an injury or because they had a mandatory attendance and what forces a mandatory attend it's come down a little bit in recent years but it's 15

[00:59:41] G on the car now so there's an impact light which comes on in the car so the trackside marshals the medical crew can tell if the impact has exceeded this amount then they automatically are assessed at the trackside Medical Center it was actually quite revealing to look at these incidents over a couple of years because it was a little bit counterintuitive to be honest so more than two thirds of the incidents happened on the Sunday on the race day and 90% we're in dry weather so this is medical incidents what fraction of those were in the first lap I'd say most were in the early laps but you do definitely get mid to late race safety cars as well where a car can go off at high speed by itself so the the bigger impacts were on

[01:00:23] Sunday in the race they were in the dry when I was a perhaps self-evidently pushing and they're doing their highest speeds in close quarters with other cars but there were five rollover accidents I think during the time that I looked at only one of which resulted in injury that was Fernando's massive crash in

[01:00:39] Melbourne a couple of years ago the impacts that happen in the wet they often very spectacular it's lots of parts flying off the car but they tended to be sort of low to medium impact and the real high risk for injury was a 40g plus impact in dry weather can you even put that in context for me for what a normal person would experience on a freeway we don't have the sensors I know but can we even estimate the impact on a car it's a very crude measurement actually because it's measured sort of on the chassis it doesn't really correlate that much with what the forces are on the driver and of course the direction of the impact influences the vector and where is it picked up on the chassis because if it's before the chassis collapses then obviously a much lesser fraction of that would hit the driver hopefully that's a very good question to which I do not know the answer so the drivers also have this in ear accelerometer they have three axis accelerometer in their ear piece and that's interrogated later so there's a much more accurate data analysis which comes after an accident by the FIA but usually that information in comes that we're going to benefit the treatment or the management of the driver in any given day that's going to be a lesson for the future and that reflects of course the forces on the skull much more closely because it's actually sitting in the middle here the driver can sustain very very high peak g-forces if they're instantaneous or very very rapid in terms of a spike of force the lower forces if they're sustained over a longer period and we're talking sort of tenths of seconds rather than thousands of seconds those are the impacts that can do a little bit more damage that's interesting and of course if you come down to seconds holding 5g for two seconds on part of an arc is yeah that's not gonna injure you but it's cuz I can injury but boy that's next level people don't get I suppose how tired drivers are after the race I mean I've got to see some drivers after races and they look as exhausted as someone who's as you said done two hours of a brutal CrossFit workout and even walking up a flight of stairs looks like it's asking them a lot the cows took a step change in speed and power and grip it was the beginning of 2017 so they became much more physical to drive at that point by a large and experienced f1 driver will cope with most scenarios they'll be tired but they're well within their physical capabilities how much weight will a driver lose during one of the harder races I guess Singapore is the archetypal physical race it's a race which always goes for the full two hours it's a city street race it's got more corners than any other circuit 24:25 corners and it's all 90-degree turns at moderate speed so in tropical heat and humidity the drivers they will often lose three or four kilos in weight they have in the car a drinks bottle if their engineers being very kind to them that might be 1.2 to 1.5 liters for a race like Singapore usually it's about half a liter but it's hot it's like drinking tea after a few minutes in the car so the driver area at the end of the

[01:03:45] Singapore Grand Prix is quite something to behold it's a drivers coming in flushed and exhausted in a faraway look in their eyes and that's race where recovery is particularly important now there was a rule change a few years ago with respect to drivers wait what was that yeah the drivers have always had a pressure on them from the engineering team to maintain that weight at the minimum possible and I guess you're trying hard and spending millions of dollars in some cases to shave hundreds of grams off the car so losing aquila off the driver is a relatively easy thing for the teams to ask with a favorable cost-benefit analysis my favorite example of this was back when I used to be a sort of pathetic cyclist I remember once going to the bike shop to get some new bottle cages and they had like the regular cages were this much and then the SuperDuper fancy carbon-fiber cages that were 19 grams lighter were 10 times more and the guy at the bike shop was trying to talk me into getting them and I was like look dude before I go and drop an extra couple hundred bucks to save 19 grams

[01:04:52] I've got about two kilos I could afford to shed I think I'll save my money for now yeah very cool so we were at the point where we had these younger drivers these teenage drivers coming in a number of whom were quite tall we had some of the older drivers like Mark Weber who were in a continuous battle to save weight and honestly we were starting to see some unhealthy what was the minimum weight set up so minimum weight was Car and Driver combined so at that time there was no reference to the drivers weight it was just lose as much as possible we had people running into problems with overtraining undernutrition we had some eating behaviors coming out which I was not comfortable with and we had Charlie riding who unfortunately passed away earlier this year was the great technical leader of the sport for the last few decades and to Charlie's credit and the FA is created I raised this issue with them and they acted very quickly so we have a new regulation this year where 80 kilos is the mark that's the driver plus their helmet their race suit and their seat and any driver who's below that level is ballast and up to 80 kilos so it basically takes the driver weight out of the equation to a large degree and I must say the drivers are absolutely delighted with this they've just got the luxury of being a kilo or a kilo and a half heavier they can put on more muscle their nutrition is just not quite the chore the daily misery that it used to be and I think we're in a much better place for that regulation now we've had women get very close to f1 I think there's even been women that have competed in races but not for a complete season is that correct yeah they've been two or three women who competed and one scored half a point I think in the 1970s when half points were awarded from time to time so it's been a pretty rare thing we've had Suzy wolf drive in free practice on a Formula one weekend as recently as a couple of years ago but it's been a long time since a female driver has raced in a Sunday race are there any females in the f2 f3 pipeline not obviously at the moment no but we have this year seen the advent of and all women's racing series in Europe called W Series and we've been closely involved in that and I must say it's been really a huge success on many levels and a wonderful experiment and I look forward to seeing that develop over the next decade or so because it's a really vexed question gender and motorsport I think there's a perception that driving an f1 car is like being a fighter pilot for example where I think intuitively men and women should be relatively equal it's a fine motor and a cognitive skill but the truth is that as we've discussed Formula One is an extremely physical activity and it's not so much f1 I think f1 maybe does play to the strengths of women in some ways some of the social complexity some of the spatial staff the power steering I think a woman absolutely can succeed in f1 but the problem comes at the grassroots levels a load of sport where we a have a very small pipeline of competitors coming through and be the environment in f3 for example is pretty hostile the cars are more physical to drive and they're up against frankly teenage males with differences in risk taking behavior testosterone levels there's both physical and right so the lack of prefrontal cortex in these male drivers is actually a competitive advantage to them at that stage and driving probably again I mean there is and there is academic literature of this kind of stuff in Olympic sports for example there is some evidence for the physical and cognitive differences between male and female athletes but I think basically to find a woman who can succeed in f1 they are absolutely out there but they'll probably be an outlier and by definition then you have to be bringing more women through the pipeline to find those outliers and W Series is a great first step in my opinion towards just providing another avenue for women to get to the top levels of motorsport and certainly there are cultural things that need to change as well I mean fathers who are funding motorsport careers undoubtedly favor sons at the moment but hopefully that will change as well W

[01:08:53] Series has proven to be a great TV success than the TV ratings from being great the depth of the driving talent has been I think it's exceeded all expectations the Racing's been really good to watch and they'll go to an expanded calendar next year and probably in the future more powerful cars as the series becomes established for prospective what are the if you go through the W series the Formula three two and one what are the relative horsepowers of each of those cars that have something ahead well a Formula One car today is less than a thousand horsepower correct yeah the electrical power makes them very talky as well so it's not just a top-line power yeah the acceleration is staggering yeah it's kind of amazing in the 80s you look at the mp4 for which is 1988 I mean that was a 1200 horsepower car yeah a based absolute based with no downforce and a manual gearbox yeah yeah and back then they had much more power available to them in qualifying they would detune the car for the race and that would use the engine once for an hour and then throw it away right so the engine was there to be blown up essentially at the maximum speed possible it is crazy this is the other I guess environmental dimension to the current Formula One that the reliability of these engines is unbelievable they have three engines to do the entire season yeah explain to people what a team has at their disposal how many tires how many gearboxes how many engines what are they trying to manage over the course of these 21 races and this is all part of the chess game part of the really interesting strategy so you have as I referenced engines across and the engine comes in different parts there's the heat recovery system the kinetic recovery system the battery so you can replace some of those parts individually without some penalty but basically you've got to do your Friday practices you've got to do your Saturday qualifying and a third of the race is on on one engine and I mean that again is an extraordinary step forward from where we were even 2010-2011 so principally a cost-cutting measure but but something that absolutely will flow through to the reliability of road cars tires there's 12 sets of tires from the weekend and again you have to select well in advance eight or twelve weeks ahead of the race what tires you're going to take to that event there's three compounds to choose from so the different compounds are either faster don't last very long or a little bit slower in terms of lap time but they'll get you through a much bigger chunk of the race and the engineers and the strategists need to work out what tires they're going to bring to a race weekend and then how they deploy them in each session which ones you're going to use to practice which ones are going to qualify on and then leave yourself with enough options for the race let's talk about the 2021 rule changes how many of those have been solidified I think they're getting closer to the final document there were some meetings I think last week in in

[01:11:48] Geneva between the regulators and the various team bosses and other stakeholders I think we have a bit of an understanding of the fact that the car is going to have some simplified aerodynamic characteristics the engines probably will stick to something very similar to the current formula and then the budget cap will probably more apply to the teams and the operations and what they can do in terms of the number of upgrades the number of different parts the level of activity they can bring into upgrading the car through the season changes will take place with the tires the tires there's going to be quite a big change so we're going from 13 inch wheels to 18 inch wheels so the tire will be a lot smaller in profile which is it may not sound very significant but actually the tire currently is relatively old-school big balloony piece of rubber that is a big part of the cars suspension at the moment and bringing in an 18-inch wheel with a very much narrower tire sidewall is going to change everything in terms of suspension and braking in aerodynamics so the cars so that's a huge challenge for the the engineers are working on even as we speak what kind you interested in motorsport in the first place in 1985 the

[01:12:59] Australian Grand Prix returns to the International Formula One calendar and so for whatever random reason I happened to watch the Australian Grand Prix this weekend in October in 1985 and the TV coverage was done with a huge amount of enthusiasm this was a big international event coming to Australia and I just caught the bug I haven't missed a race in the 34 years since it's been an incredible ride you were a triathlete right did a little triathlon I have to say not a lot of training in the current schedule but did my first race in 1988 and struggled through a couple of Iron

[01:13:31] Man's yes learn a lot about being athlete actually even even by being a hopeless weekend warrior yeah what did you learn from that that translated to what you're doing today I think you have a basic understanding what it's like to train I think what it's like to get up in the morning and have to do a training session that might be a bit of a chore on that particular day I think you have a fundamental understanding of the difference between aerobic anaerobic training some of those really simple things I mean as we reference I come from an intensive care critical care background so I rely very heavily on my coaches and my coaching director Peter

[01:14:06] McKnight to implement the technicalities of coaching for our drivers this is not my strength or forte but I think just having been an amateur athlete gives you a little bit of appreciation for what it's like to have to stick to a training program and then compete even on whatever level the race day is a race day right no matter what the stakes are yeah it's interesting right I mean it's sort of like you can take your own race as seriously as it's being taken on the world's biggest stage yeah and I look back now and I'm an in particular so badly there's so many things I would do in terms of nutrition in terms of sleep in terms of structure of training now

[01:14:40] I'm looking forward at some point in the next decade to having a second triathlon career and implementing a lot of things I've learned from my fantastic coaches in recent times it seems that the drivers today are much more tuned into nutrition and exercise than drivers of 25 years ago again sin I keep referencing him was kind of the outlier I mean the seriousness with which he took his fitness with which he took his training was the stuff of legends that was not the norm and when you look back and you he watch James

[01:15:12] Hunt amazing driver not training it's interesting that you mentioned James I think probably niki lauda was the first and niki in recovering from his horrendous injuries in the Nurburgring in 1976 was maybe the first example of somebody who really implemented a serious physical training regimen but certainly said I was a big standout in his time and then Michael Schumacher perhaps built on that into the current era but yeah the benchmark keeps rising and most of the drivers are even if they're not particularly interested in the absolute peak of physical preparation they have a pretty reasonable understanding of what a strength workout is and what their aerobic capacity needs to be to get through it to our race so I didn't know this about you until somewhat recently but you survived cancer and it was quite advanced I sort of don't think of that time as any sort of great survival threat like an f1 season it all happened so fast that it all moved so quickly a bit 10 years ago just last month actually I was working in the north of Australia with the flying doctors in a very remote area and

[01:16:14] I had developed testicular cancer which I diagnosed by myself on one of them very early portable ultrasound machines we had up there as you know it's a cancer if you had to choose a cancer to have if it's the one with the best survival prospects you know in excess of 90% so whilst it was you know it was real chemotherapy and real surgery you did not have seminal - cancer core so it was non Semenova and I actually did have pulmonary metastasis as well and looking back now it was a relatively rough ride

[01:16:44] I had some thrombotic complications as well had a pretty profound paraneoplastic thrombophilia you explained of what that means so in some cancers in some people you'll develop a clotting tendency and in retrospect the first day I went in for a scan I had a an IV drip put in and sort of a little clot formed all the way up my arm that should have been a bit of a warning sign but you then have a permanent catheter implanted to receive the chemotherapy drugs and that sits in the large vein next to the heart and mine in fact clotted up completely so there's something called superior vena cava syndrome which every medical student sees in the textbooks and I had never seen really in real life and I work out one morning looked in the mirror and yeah I had basically a complete blockage of blood returned to the heart from the upper part of my body and but it was a an interesting lesson in the realities of being a patient I think I had always been a relatively empathetic doctor but just the logistics of having to go to appointments having to be stabbed with needles multiple times a week the fatigue of the drugs having to find a car parking space at the hospital every day I think it just gives you a great appreciation for the experience of being ill and being a patient and I had access to really good private care I had access to virtually my hand-picked specialists in the different fields that I utilized but even then things go wrong you're still subject to the same vagaries of Nursing and nursing shifts and blood collectors and adverse reactions to drugs no matter who you are we are all still human right was there any point during your illness when it wasn't a given that you were gonna survive even getting through all the chemo so not to get too deep into the weeds but I did have these lung lesions which yeah I mean that stage for non seminal - particular cancer is not a walk in the park or a given that you're gonna survive

[01:18:32] Lance Armstrong also had stage 4 non seminal - testicular cancer his odds were 50/50 at the time of his diagnosis I mean mine were a lot better than that I think closer to 80 or 90% but it's still a non significant non-trivial chance of death I suppose but I'd traveled in Africa a lot I'd had a couple of screening chest x-rays in the past an occupational screening x-ray and then another one when we as part of your

[01:18:58] TB screening we'd actually had an intensive care patient who turned out unexpectedly to have a diagnosis of TB so the staff in the unit had been screened so I'd had two little lesions on my lungs which were known from previous x-rays whether there was an old granuloma from somewhere in Africa or whether it was I think one of them was probably an intra pulmonary lymph node so there were these lesions and they're on the scan and nobody sort of really knew if they were significant but lo and behold they disappeared with the chemotherapy so it was really only at the end of the process that it was absolutely understood to have been a stageful tumor so I didn't get to necessarily live through all the anxiety of that and it was only in retrospect that the understanding was there perhaps the prognosis wasn't as good as we had thought all along so how much time were you on the road each year now I had about 40 nights in my own bed in

[01:19:49] Switzerland last year you don't live in Australia anymore no I'm a Swiss rate at present I do get to spend about seven or eight weeks per year at home in Australia so we have a race in Melbourne so getting a little bit of time before and after that event and then around some of the Asian races I try to sneak home for a week it's always very refreshing to see friends and family and have a surf as well so how do you manage this toll of the schedule on you I mean it's your job is to take care of everybody else and manage the toll but what do you do to manage it in yourself and your team I mean you have a very large team of course of people like Pete and Tommy and then of course all of these trainers that are working directly the drivers I mean how do you manage yourself and that team managing a business as you probably know as a clinician is not necessarily that something that comes naturally so it's pretty demanding and honestly if it wasn't a sport that I had a great passion for I wouldn't do this if I was invited to a similar job in football or basketball or something else I probably wouldn't do it it's passion for the sport and living in the middle of the history that you're making appreciation from of whether the sport has come from that makes it work I think it's been really difficult to do any sort of structured form or physical training I have tried to pay a lot of attention to sleep it's very difficult at this time of year in terms of the travel schedule but I really try and prioritize seven or eight hours sleep wherever we do wherever we go and nutrition I suppose

[01:21:16] I've used a lot of time restricted eating in recent years as you saw last year when you visited us in the paddock we're presented with an abundance of really palatable excellent food and team buffets and it's remarkable to the extent to which you can eat quite healthy if you choose to but there's certainly some desserts there which are pass up and I think time restricted eating and a little bit of fasting not to the extent of long and fast like you've famously experiment with yourself

[01:21:45] Peter but that stuff can be really powerful and just trying to get outdoors get in the sunlight it might be only every three or four weeks that you get to get outdoors three or four days in a row but just try and get on the bike try and paddle try and do something and also move throughout the day I'm lucky that in the f1 paddock we are on our feet and getting our 10,000 steps almost in the course of a routine workday so that helps so basically you've got to be a little more careful with respect to your sleep and your exercise than your default environment would allow you to be you could very easily sort of fall off a cliff doing this yeah it could be an extremely unhealthy job and part of our work is managing the team members through their same experiences we have two or three of the teams with an embedded coach or physiotherapist and so we try to pass on this kind of insight these healthy habits to the teams as well and many of the traveling team members are very invested in this others are less interested but I think it has an impact for sure what have you not yet brought to this sport that you think you're capable of bringing through your team so Formula One is perceived as being the pinnacle of excellence in in every area certainly in motorsport and in terms of the engineering and the development of the car that's absolutely true probably operationally as well on the human side honestly there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit and we've spent a number of years feeding myself just honestly getting basic systems in place our coaches have a fair bit of latitude and freedom to work within their individual skills and very importantly they work within the individual skills and strengths and weaknesses and attention spans of their own driver so making our system a system though has been priority so it's just getting everybody doing some basic fundamentals of monitoring and working to a schedule of assessments across the year so that job is done now and I think we're looking to start to innovate and I think again in any sport there are literally hundreds of scientifically proven interventions that you could make for an athlete but the art of what we do is fitting that into the lifestyle and the travel schedule and again the attention span an interest level of the athlete that's in front of you so I think there are things that we can do in terms of cognitive skills perhaps eye training perhaps proprioception I don't know what those things are yet but I'd like to study them in a little more detail there's an incredible lack of physiological monitoring of any driver in the car even now perhaps we can talk about that a little bit in a moment but the other interface probably is bringing together the way that an engineer manages their driver across a race weekend with the coaching that we are doing and we've started over the last year to really try to get the engineers to work more closely with the performance coaches and likewise to give our performance coaches a bit more engineering knowledge and understanding of what the overlays of a good lap time looks like what it means to break later to steer differently and try to get those two streams of information coming into the driver to talk to each other and integrate a lot more why is there such a dearth of physiologic information going back to the paddock I mean when you sit in one of these garages and look at the information that's coming in about the car it makes the information that the

[01:25:07] Mission Control was getting from the moon landing there is more information coming in about tire pressure than the entire Apollo 11 rocket going to the moon and yet you don't know their heart rate you don't know their heart rate variability you don't know their electrolytes you don't know fluid status there's so many things about the actual driver you don't know in fact do you know anything about the driver in real-time in the car very little and there's a few historical reasons for that one is a simple matter of the regulations so there's race suits and the fireproof underwear that the drivers are wearing are heavily heavily regulated so right down to the stitching on the sponsor labels there's actual standards for that kind of stuff and it has to be tested and homologated so so there's a safety issue yeah there's been a real limitation of what you can attach to a driver in terms of physiological monitoring on top of that the teams will not add any weight to the car so you 100 grams of some kind of measuring or monitoring device in the vehicle would not be acceptable and then whilst what we do is absolutely incredibly valued in terms of promoting human performance it's often a bit of a low priority compared to the time pressure that's involved in just getting a car out on the track and getting it developed the bandwidth for any sort of human innovation has traditionally been relatively narrow the FIA also mandate that any sort of monitoring on the driver has to be purely for a safety purpose so at present there's not a lot of interest from the governing body in terms of performance or physiological measurement for understandable reasons but wouldn't those translate to safety for example we don't really have a sense of how often accidents are taking place because of fatigue that is physiologically predictable yeah indeed

[01:26:56] I think we're a long way from measuring that probably but this last two years we've had a biometric sensor glove introduced for the drivers so they have essentially heart rate and oxygen saturations measured in the driving glove and the defined purpose of that is so that the trackside intervention services can see what the drivers physiologically doing after an impact whilst they are on their way to the scene so that's a first step and I suspect we'll be a little more liberal in the future and there's going to be some pressure from television and digital streaming as well to measure physiological parameters of the driver in the car as well in which I must say is not an idea that has received such a warm reception from the drivers themselves it's a potential competitive advantage and information advantage that they're giving away to their competitors but I think we'll see more of this we're looking at a couple of devices now which will probably be compatible with the regulations and we'll have a couple of projects potentially next year where we're measuring in the car a lot more how long does it take a driver to learn a new circuit so this race in Vietnam next year how long does a driver have to prepare to learn that in a simulator it's probably less than you think the good drivers will get out there within half a dozen laps and they should be pretty close to on the pace you know they'll take another tenth or two off across a race weekend as they get better but the sim is a very important part they'll prepare for each circuit specifically with a simulator session but it's not the same as being out there sitting in the seat and feeling the forces so as they go from this weekend let's just say when we're done with this race on Sunday night two weeks from now they'll be in

[01:28:34] Brazil so that's a long enough stretch that many of them I assume will go home everyone will go home for sure yeah when did they start getting in the simulator and driving Interlagos before they get down there so simulators are a limited resource and depending on the infrastructure of the team you there will be junior drivers that we test drivers there will be others who need to use the sim so probably somewhere next

[01:28:55] Wednesday or Thursday most of the race drivers will have their day or their half-day and the simulator they are learning the circuit for sure but actually a big part of a job on that day is evaluating other aero parts and other upgrades to the car so it's not just there for the luxury of the driver learning the circuit is it expected the driver learns the circuit in the offseason and they've at the European circuits they will have driven most of the circuits many times in the junior categories it's in these long-haul flyaway races where a rookie driver will be encountering the circuits for the first time and honestly they'll have a lot of engineering briefings across a weekend to help familiarize ation but they'll get into the swing of the circuit within a handful of laps and then build on that across the race weekend by Sunday they should have a very limited disadvantage to people who've been there before it's still amazing to me when I think about how long it takes me to learn circuits you've gotta remember I guess each circuit is different from year to year the adjustments that are being made to the car from corner to corner will change with the characteristics of the car from year to year so even people who've been there before a kind of relearning how to drive the circuit in this year's car to achieve the optimal lap time it's unbelievable I don't know that I'll ever be able to successfully communicate to my friends to my family to listeners of this podcast who if anyone's not a fan of Formula one and they're still listening at this point that would be kind of a minor miracle I guess but this has been a great discussion because I think it has probably been the most complete discussion I've brought to the podcast of this sport why I think it's so special and what's involved in it I think that this sort of physical emotional and cognitive piece I don't think we've talked much about the emotional I think we've talked about the physical for sure the cognitive overload is staggering I don't consider myself one who lacks in cognition but I could never manage the cognitive load that these guys manage but then there's this other piece which is the emotional piece which is it's not a sport we're getting pissed off does you much good emotional control in the car is incredibly important and it's in the car it's in front of the media because you can easily with an air and comment create an enormous amount of stress next week at the next race let alone contract renegotiations and fighting for one of those pressures 20 seats yeah and as we reference we're dealing now with teenagers in many cases and teenage drivers are just like other teenagers we may have an enormous amount of wisdom to impart but there's a point where a young person perhaps doesn't even have enough life experience to understand the lesson that they're being given and it's gratifying obviously to see a driver develop through the junior categories and then some point in their early 20s the pennies start to drop from the pieces start to come together and they just have gathered enough experience to understand how all the strands of their behavior and their approaches to things and the motives and and the layers of social complexity around them all come together and can be coordinated in a way that's to their advantage so yeah and they have relationships they have family relationships they may gel well with their race engineer there may be other team members that they have to manage more judiciously so all this stuff is going on all the time and to privileged to be there sort of helping and guiding in some way making a small contribution to not only growing competitive race drivers but good human beings in this crazy sport that we live in do you think 2021 will sort of reshuffle the order of the teams a bit there's reason to think that the midfield teams might have their day more often we may get more variability occasion in the results but whenever there's a large regulation change the teams with the most resources are the ones who we'll exploit that to the best of their abilities and you do risk the top teams getting further ahead for as a period of time although with the last rag change we did see a big swap between redbull and Mercedes indeed so Mercedes to that credit were well ahead of their competitors on the engine development Red Bull and Ferrari were busy fighting for championships through 2013-2014 and Mercedes had put a lot more resource into the new engine regulations and probably stole the march on everybody by a year or more and that's taken five or six years for that convergence to happen you add aerodynamic changes on top of that and I think it's gonna be a fascinating year what's been the biggest surprise for you this year performance wise has it been the sort of mini sort of performance comeback of McLaren what has surprised you we've got a long history with

[01:33:30] McLaren I worked closely with McLaren for a number of years and it's a team that's had a massive cultural transformation in the last 18 months and I think you're right it has been a surprised to see how quickly they've started to turn things around they're the solid number four team and they've had some really bad luck and they're still right there in number four they really are the best of the rest yeah absolutely and you can make a case that the traditional private team that's not a manufacturer owned team could be a truly endangered species in Formula One now so it's to the credit of everyone at

[01:34:02] McLaren who's been able to turn that project around bringing a lot of fresh momentum fresh blood and I think they're going back to Mercedes engines in a couple of years I think their future is looking pretty good at the moment Luke this has been awesome it's so late here in Austin tonight I'm just glad we got to record this I knew that there was gonna be really hard to for us to find a window to talk so I'm grateful that we've been able to find this one and I'm grateful for all the insight you've shared with us and I never get tired of talking about Formula One with you so thank you for humoring me continuing the discussion and doing so in front of a few other people yeah well we've got a couple more days to dissect a lot more detail about this point can't wait to do so at the track I appreciate the opportunity Peter particularly to talk to a North American audience about this sport because it is a traditionally very

[01:34:48] European centric and I think anyone who watches the sport for a couple of months or what the Netflix documentary gets into a little bit of the soap opera understands a few of the personalities there there's a richness there which is pretty difficult to stop watching one screen to it I agree you know I actually just had this discussion with my wife yesterday is tell me another professional sport where you can name every athlete yeah indeed there's only 20 of them I know every one of them by name I'd recognize any one of them if I bumped into in a grocery store in Airport and as you said the Netflix special gives you a layer of nuance in the tension that you don't even catch off TV and it shows you the drama that exists up and down the field even when it's not about winning the championship yeah very special thanks for the opportunity all right Luke I'll see you tomorrow indeed looking forward to thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of this attrition method and membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic pay per person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly AMA episodes are asking me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to squeals like this the qualities which are a super short podcast typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through Friday highlighting the best questions topics and tactics discussed on previous episodes of the drive this is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone steep discounts on products that I believe in but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on if you want to learn more and access these member-only benefits you can head over to Peter Atia
