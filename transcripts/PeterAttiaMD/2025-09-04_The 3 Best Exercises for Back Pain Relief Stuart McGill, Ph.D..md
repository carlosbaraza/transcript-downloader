## AI Summary

Here's my detailed analysis of this clip from The Drive podcast featuring Stuart McGill discussing back exercises:

1. **Executive Summary**:
Dr. Stuart McGill discusses the "Big Three" exercises for back health, but importantly challenges the myth that these exercises are universally beneficial. He emphasizes the importance of proper assessment before prescription and explains the biomechanical principles behind core stability. The discussion focuses on how to create proximal stiffness for better movement efficiency and pain management.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Core stability is analogous to stabilizer bars on construction equipment - creating a stable base for movement [00:02:01]
- Proximal stiffness is crucial for efficient force transfer and preventing energy leaks [00:03:36]
- Neural stiffness post-exercise can last 20+ minutes in some individuals [00:09:32]
- Not all body types benefit from these exercises (e.g., individuals with significant abdominal mass) [00:01:25]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Use 10-second intervals for side planks (Russian training science principle) [00:07:36]
- Consider two 12-minute sessions daily (mid-morning and mid-afternoon) for pain management [00:09:32]

Context-specific:
- Assessment should always precede exercise prescription [00:01:25]
- Modified versions available for those with rotator cuff issues [00:06:55]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
The "Big Three" exercises:
1. Modified curl-up [00:06:04]
2. Side plank [00:07:36]
3. Bird dog [00:08:03]

Training Methodology:
- Russian descending pyramid approach [00:07:36]
- Focus on form over fatigue [00:07:36]
- 10-second interval training for endurance building [00:07:36]

8. **References & Resources**:
Expert: Dr. Stuart McGill, spine biomechanics expert [throughout clip]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Non-specific low back pain... I think it's a myth and it doesn't exist." [00:02:01]
"The assessment always leads us to the solution." [00:01:25]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the specific assessment protocols Dr. McGill uses?
- How should the exercises be modified for different populations?
- What are the contraindications for each exercise?
- What is the optimal progression scheme for these exercises?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Let's talk about those three exercises, Stuart. There are three exercises. Um, there's two of them that I've done consistently for quite some time. I really uh fancy them a bit. Um, the the the third one, the bird dog, I I only do occasionally. Um, but let's go through the three of them. And um, is it safe to say that that you and and just for the listener, we're going to link to videos of these, right? So, you know, you're going to do your best to explain them and provide the rationale for them, but ultimately a demonstration will be forthcoming through videos we'll link to in the show notes. Um, but but this is kind of like your >> I don't know your core nutrition, right?

[00:00:45] This is sort of the everybody should be doing this. You don't wait till you have back pain to do this. Is that safe to say? >> No, it isn't. No, that that this is a a bit of a myth and something that I've been fighting basically my whole career. Oh, Miguel is the big Migill big three. >> Okay. >> Uh there are some people that are far too stiff and this is not the mechanism of their back pain and we don't need to go there. Um, have you ever seen the type of body build where they have a huge pneumatic cushion in front called a belly and it it slaps on their thighs.

[00:01:25] It's that pendulus of this. Do you ever see spine instability in in in that type of architecture? I don't. >> Interesting. >> So probably those people have difficulty getting on and off the floor. The big three is not for them. Got it. So there might be again the assessment always leads us to the solution. >> And so uh no the big three uh well let let me I I need to have a discussion of what stability is in terms of creating resilience and performance.

[00:02:01] Then why are those particular exercises important and then how to do them? If if I could follow that logic line, Peter. >> Absolutely. Yeah, let's let's do it. And then the other thing, Stuart, if you want to throw it in there, do you want to talk about some of the hallmarks of your assessment wherever it fits into that into that uh into those three things? So, so t take it away. Yeah. >> All right. So, remind me, we're going to talk about non-specific low back pain and how I think it's a myth and it doesn't exist. That will take us into the assessment. >> Okay. >> So, let's go back to a basic discussion of stability. So if I was uh I might use in the example of a backhoe. So a backhoe is a machine with a tractor and it has an arm on the back to dig earth. The first thing the operator does is put down the stabilizer bars to lock the tractor into the ground because if you don't do that, you can't pull earth. You just pull the machine around. So what's the human equivalent of that? We live in a linkage just like machinery. In other words, let's take the bench press muscle pec major. Pec major originates on my rib cage, spans my ball and socket joint of the shoulder and inserts on the humorris. So when I contract and shorten the pec major, it flexes my arm. So if I'm wanting to do a push or a punch, there it is. That's on the distal side of the joint.

[00:03:36] Proximally, that same muscle shortening collapses my rib cage towards my shoulder joint. So, if all I used was the muscle that spans the joint, that isn't a very effective push. All I'm doing is collapsing my own linkage. Or, as an engineer, we would say, well, we've just created an energy leak. So, I'm now going to build proximal stiffness. So I'm going to lock my core, create stiffness through my torso which is proximal to the joint. So now when I contract the muscle 100% of the motion is directed distally. Now I've got my push. >> So what is the best most efficient way to create a proximal stiffness? We searched for years doing all kinds of tests of uh uh every abdominal exercise you could think of, back exercises, twisting, powoff presses, throwing things, etc.

[00:04:41] The three exercises that kept bubbling up to the top in the criteria of sparing the spine while you're doing them because these people are hurting. You you you don't have cart blanch to load up their spine. uh a guaranteed stability or proximal stiffness. And it was later in my career that we found um there is a residual stiffness that occurs. So if you do the big three and you are an NFL football team, if you do the big three prior to practice, you will run and cut just a little bit faster. So you're on the field, you run and you cut. The stiffer the core when the hips explode into external rotation, you're now creating a a faster directional change.

[00:05:34] So uh what were the muscles or what were the exercises? Um a a modified cura which remember and now I'm just going to start a little bit of an assessment. I'm going to take a patient. I'm going to have them sit on the stool and I say, "Do you have symptoms right now?" And let humor me and let's say you don't. Now, I'm going to say, "Drop your chest down. Does that cause your Oh, yeah. My left toe is going numb and I've got back pain."

[00:06:04] Good. Bring your chin down. And they might say that'll increase their pain or decrease it. But the point is that posture created their pain. If that is true, when they lay on their back and they imprinted their back into the floor doing a Pilates roll up, for example, uh that would be their specific pain trigger. So, it's not much of a therapeutic exercise, but we would say put your hands under your low back as you're laying on the ground. Lift your elbows. Now, hover up your head, neck, and shoulders. And we're going to propel the abdominal contraction. rea slips and allow the diaphragm to become the athlete inside this barrel. So that was the foundation of the modified curlup.

[00:06:55] Now if the person has a rotator cuff issue or we will hack it and make it tolerable. Um, then I would see people, well, let's let's take a uh a dumbbell or a kettle bell and we're going to raise it up laterally in the frontal plane like this for the side of the core. >> That would trigger pain in a lot of people, but uh I'll demonstrate all this if you want. Uh but we could then do a side plank on the floor. The beauty of the side plank is only half the musculature is heavily challenged. The downside is heavily challenged. The upside is not. You've only got half the load on the spine. Very spine sparing.

[00:07:36] We prescribe it on 10 second intervals. Why? We use the Russian training science to show you build endurance through repeated 10-second exposures, not getting tired to the point where you break form. Mhm. >> Nor do you nor do you develop a neural fatigue and you get a much higher tolerable training level with this what we call the Russian descending pyramid.

[00:08:03] And then for the back muscles, look at the beauty of the bird dog where you extend one leg the opposite. One half of my low back is active. One half of my upper back is active on the other side. We developing a nice DNF pattern. We're creating stiffness and stability in the core. We're teaching the brain to disassociate ball and socket joint motion of the shoulders and hips uh with only half the spine load of say a Roman chair extension or something like that. So that bubble got to be uh uh a fabulous uh exercise.

[00:08:44] Then we did experiments where we would train people. We would just have a single session exposure. We would measure the core stiffness prior to doing the big three. They do the big three on the Russian descending pyramid and then we would rememeasure their torso stiffness. Peter, they they were they were stiffer. And some of my muscle uh physiology colleagues said, "Well, you've added a turdness to the muscle. I don't think so. I think the brain created a lasting neural stiffness and in some people it lasts about 20 minutes. Some people it lasts longer. So you will see some patients who say you know when I do the big three I don't have pain for the next hour. Fabulous.

[00:09:32] What you're going to do is midm morning do a 12minut big three session. Midafter afternoon do a 12. So, these are the little tricks and hacks to slowly wind a person down out of pain. >> I'm Peter Aia.
