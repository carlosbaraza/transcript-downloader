## Description

Full title: #56 – Jocko Willink, retired Navy SEAL, Part II of II: Sleep, fasting, raising kids, discipline, taking ownership, and the impact of war

Original release date: 6/3/19

In the second installment of this 2 part series, Jocko shares his sleep routine and attitude towards sleep, we talk about his meals (and occasional indulgences), his experience with fasting, and touch briefly on his workout routine. Jocko explains his approach to leading a family, instilling values in his kids, and working with others who may not share your same principles. We also find out what prompted Jocko to make discipline the underpinning principle of his life, when it might make sense to quit, and the philosophical topics such as free will, mindset, and whether or not you can change someone. We also discuss 9/11 and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the future of warfare, and perhaps more importantly, how Jocko’s experience in combat has shaped and impacted his life to this day.

We discuss:
-Where was Jocko when the 9/11 attack occurred? What did he think? [5:45];

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Jocko and like

[00:04:14] Madonna sting or Cher he's one of those rare individuals that only needs to go by one name for those not familiar with Jocko he spent 20 years in the SEAL Teams where he was a commander of SEAL team threes task unit bruiser I believe which led the Battle of Ramadi becoming one of the more decorated Special

[00:04:31] Operations units of the Iraq war chucker returned from the Iraq war served as an officer in charge of training seals on the west coast and ultimately when he stepped down from that role he co-founded Ashland front a leadership consulting company along the way he's become a New York Times bestselling author on leadership and has also written a number of frankly fantastic kids books which my kids adore he hosts the jakka podcast which is an amazing podcast and of all the podcasts I've ever been on that episode that I did with Jack I was certainly one of my favorites he's a black belt in jujitsu and the co-founder of victory MMA in San

[00:05:06] Diego I'm at Chaco maybe four years ago through another mutual friend Kirk parsley himself a seal this podcast was a ton of fun also took a while we sort of lost track of time and before you knew it I realized this was gonna have to be released over two weeks and not just one in the second installment Jocko and I discuss 9/11 and the war in Iraq the future of machines in war as well as medicine raising kids we talked about one thing that I get pinged about constantly to talk about with Jocko which is sleep we talked about giving up we talked about freewill mindset we talked about his indulgences fasting and we end up with a quick guest Q&A with my daughter Olivia who was waiting all day to meet Jocko and couldn't wait to poke her head in when she got home from school so without further delay please enjoy the second installment of my discussion with Jacque where were you on 9/11 physically like the moment you heard so I was in college at the time so I was in the Navy I had got my Commission in order to have your

[00:06:08] Commission in the military you have to read college I hadn't been to college yet meaning because you were enlisted you couldn't get above a certain level no I literally had to go they told me I had to go cuz I tried to not go okay they said you got to go to college and I said I'll just stay in I don't need to go to college don't worry about me you don't have to pay for it we're all good and they said no idiot you have to go to college or something we can find so I was going to college at the University of San Diego because waiting in my car for class and heard about in the morning like when I woke up meaning you heard a plane I plane hit the tower okay cool I figured it was a yeah I think this says now whatever some idiot was trying to sightsee or whatever so that would have been like 6:00 a.m. your time yeah yeah now it's 7:30 a.m. your time 10:30 or whatever time on the

[00:06:50] East Coast and yeah the second plane hits and I go okay we're under attack you knew it that moment exactly the other one hit I was like oh yeah this is an attack I didn't even think I knew that it was a passenger plane yet cuz it wasn't like I woke up saw that something happened and said okay I'm gonna sit down watch the news now cuz every day something happens that could be the first indicating signs of a major problem or item he just can't track everything a shooting happens somewhere well generally the shooting happens then they arrest someone or someone gets killed and then that's not the beginning of a massive terrorist attack so when the first plane hit I didn't think about it it was like oh wow that sucks but as soon as the second one hit I realized yeah we were under attack and how long until you could actually see the images on TV I would say by 11 o'clock I mean by the time I saw on TV the towers were still up on how long did it take for them to fall I do it in East

[00:07:40] Coast time but the towers were still up when I saw it on TV yeah you know which still kind of mitigated the tragedy right it was much less visually striking right the towers were hit they're on fire okay we're gonna put out the fire the horrible that these people were killed in the plane oh my gosh I bet some of those people on the towers were killed as well that's horrible still the intensity when the towers collapsed was really intensifying it was an intensifying thing it's interesting that you immediately understood what was happening I have another friend who was a marine and he just happened to be in

[00:08:15] Australia for some training gig on 9/11 his reaction was I mean I'm amazed at the insight right which was he realized oh it's never gonna be the same he understood that to be a Pearl Harbor like moment yeah which you did as well I mean that's yeah yeah I can honestly say I couldn't even think like I just didn't know what to think

[00:08:36] I was deer in headlights like I was just you know I was thinking much more about I remember because I was in the hospital it was like oh my god are we gonna need to open up a bigger burn unit like I was just thinking about a bunch of dumb blocking and tackling stuff purely tactical right purely tactical not a strategic thought my body yeah and yet now in retrospect it seems so obvious yeah I thought I was pretty cool because at the time there's a guy called a detailer which is someone that's in charge of your actual billet in the military so you're gonna get assigned a job and the person that assigns you your job at a SEAL team or at a forward base or whatever he is gonna be the guy called the detailer the officer detailer at the time was a guy that I had worked for who was a friend of mine who is a just a fantastic guy great guy had a great relationship with him and I called him up and said hey sir it's Jocko get me out of college I'll go to college later I'll do online college don't worry about any of that please please please get me back to a SEAL team right now please you're having this call the evening of September 11th within a day or two I was making the call and begging him to please get me out of college and send me to a SEAL team or I can go into play and he told me hey finish college this war is going to last a long time and so here's a guy that was more mature than me and smarter than me and I still didn't believe him but the reason I started off by saying I thought

[00:10:03] I was cool because I saw him and his wife the other day and I was talking to him and I was talking to both of them then saying hey I remember on September 11th I called and asked you please to send me to a SEAL team and this is where I thought I was cool and he said you know how many people call me that day everyone called him so again when you talk about like the attitude that right there is another great example of like every SEAL officer that was anywhere but at a SEAL team called up and said please send me to a SEAL team right now so did you finish college yep yep so you returned to the SEAL team what year spring of 2003 so six months after the Iraqi invasion right after the

[00:10:42] Iraqi invasion I showed up at the SEAL team explain for people listening who aren't familiar with the nomenclature so the people have heard of obviously if SEAL Team six got a lot of discussion what are the numbers mean how big is a team so I would say the biggest misconception is people think that a

[00:10:59] SEAL team what you think of a SEAL team people think of a shield platoon or SEAL task unit which is like oh you think you're a team 12 guys an actual SEAL team is a bunch of platoons and all the platoons generally don't work together so you'll work maybe in one two or three platoons sometimes occasionally might do something bigger than that SEAL Teams have done some operations that were bigger than that coordinated but generally you're just gonna be one two or three SEAL platoons operating so that's what it is the SEAL team the odd-numbered SEAL Teams are on the west coast the even-number shield teams are on the East Coast and are they numbered in the order of like the first one was just SEAL team and then the second one became two and then three

[00:11:37] SEAL team one and SEAL team two were commissioned at the same time meaning back in the sixties a kin the sixties yeah yeah so that's what it is as we grew they've made more SEAL Teams and there are how many today four per Coast so there's up to eight yeah you were on more than one weren't you I was at SEAL team one SEAL team two SEAL team seven and SEAL team three in that order yep so you finished at three okay yep so when you're coming out of college in o3 you are going into SEAL team I went to SEAL team seven you know and I showed up at

[00:12:07] SEAL team seven the SEAL team at the time so you do a workup to prepare to go on deployment and these guys were just about done with her workup so what happened was the commander of SEAL Team seven was another guy that I had worked for and was pretty close with and I showed up at his SEAL team without a seal platoon so I was just a guy are gonna go on deployment do whatever I could and I remember I was walking we were walking across the walkway there and he said you look mad chuckle what's wrong he goes what can I do for you that's what he said he said what can I do for you and I said give me a one-way ticket to Iraq which is of course again this is what everyone was saying at the time and then he said stand by and I was kind of interested in that reply fast forward a little bit he ended up firing one of the platoon commanders and put me in charge of a platoon so I took over a platoon that was getting ready to deploy and again I'm the luckiest guy in the world because to show up at a SEAL team and get us the old platoon that's getting ready to pull it to Iraq it doesn't get much better than that did you spend any time in Afghanistan I went to Afghanistan but I didn't fight there at all

[00:13:11] I flew through there to do some visits with some senior personnel but I never did anything there no and when you talk to guys that's combat in both how did they compare it the funny thing was guys that were with me and task unit bruiser that then went over to Afghanistan the principles of combat don't change one of the big things was one of my buddies described it as in Ramadi was like oh you got streets and you got buildings that's your low ground and then your high ground in Afghanistan you had valleys and Peaks and don't want to dominate the high ground just like you did in the city I want to get good angles I mean the geometry is the same but the distances are further so and then one of my other guys that went directly from pretty close to there after went from

[00:13:54] Ramadi he said that in the urban combat the rapidity with which things unfold is a lot tighter so you don't have much time to make decision there's a building right there there's a guy in it things don't unfold for very long whereas in Afghanistan unless you're in the urban part of Afghanistan or you're in a small village and it's the same thing at distances you have a little bit more time to think but they both have incredible challenges and both situations were brutal in many ways how many troops are still in Afghanistan

[00:14:20] American troops I don't know what the number is right now as low as it's been presumably since the invasion yeah low what are the differences and similarities between the American experience in Afghanistan and the Russian one a decade earlier slash Soviet I guess to be more precise because the Soviets in Afghanistan struck me a lot like Vietnam yeah it was harsh very harsh the tough thing is that the difference is between the US military in the Soviet military is pretty immense one of the books that I covered on my podcast is written by a

[00:14:54] Russian soldier that fought in Chechnya and it's a crazy book and this guy his name is arkady bap chenko I think is his name and the reason that it's interesting is do you remember not too long ago maybe a year ago there was a journalist that was assassinated in Ukraine I don't I remember this yeah so this journalist was assassinated in the

[00:15:18] Ukraine and it was this guy Babb chenko who had written this book which is just an incredible book and he was assassinated by Russians in it out that he faked his own assassination so that he could like prove something and he's just crazy like Russian guy so he's in hiding right now yeah he's in hiding right now but anyways he wrote this incredible book what was really crazy about this book is these soldiers in the Russian army you're out fighting this brutal enemy which was the insurgency in Chechnya they're sawing heads off of people it's as bad as you can make it and then they come back at night and their sergeants beat them and their captain's beat them and they're just abused and they're drinking vodka it's a horrible situation books called one soldier's war and it's just a book that's um it really shows you the difference between the American military and the Russian military and you know what the Russians are hard people I think everyone knows that it was a part of where he rattles off you know the the sergeants beat the corporals the staff sergeants beat the sergeants the lieutenant's Beata and he just goes right down the chain of command everyone is getting beaten like really they're gonna beat the [ __ ] out of you why because they're bored why because you didn't get water for them when they wanted you to you're gonna get beaten and that's what they're living through so you have that going into

[00:16:42] Afghanistan so the point to is that you're saying the Morales Morales frickin horrible yeah the morale is absolutely frickin horrible the other thing is like who ends up in fighting units in the Russian military it's the downtrodden people it's the misconception that people think in America and people think America it's only the poor people that go on the military it's like now there's all kinds of people in the military and it's voluntary so you can go you cannot go in

[00:17:09] Russia it's like oh if you got money you're not going in there if you're a prominent person your kids aren't going in the military it's only the people that didn't have any other choice that are gonna end up there so yeah their morale was really bad and then fighting against the Afghans who are hardened fighters and kind of like the Russians used their terrain and their environment as their defense so the Afghans do the same thing which is hey we have mountains we have Hills and then they got the Stinger missiles from us and it's like mmm the movie

[00:17:38] Charlie Wilson's War does a pretty good job of actually showing some of that stuff yeah it's sort of hard believe I remember hearing a story I don't know if it's correct that sometimes the Stingers wouldn't misfire and blow up so I shouldn't say it would fire so you would get the shot off but the device would actually blow ups if a guy who fires it dies so he hits his target but dies in the story was initially the mahajabeen thought that that was actually a feature of like that's how willing they were to die right it was like wait I get to blow up a Russian airplane and die at the same time yeah yeah bonus bonus programs sorry that's in this we have to fix the issue there that's not the way it's supposed to be it's another classic case of insurgency a good you find out that this big organization can't maneuver like you can that's how you beat them right that's how you beat them I was talking with a company about that the other day like okay here's what you're up against you're up against Titans and you will not beat them in a war of attrition they can outspend you they can all hire you they can outwork you they can out produce you literally so the only way you're gonna beat them is you have to be more maneuverable than them you have to find out what their weaknesses are cuz they do have weaknesses because when you're that big guess what you're not mobile anymore so how are you going to attack their weaknesses that's what you have to figure out cuz you can't beat him in a war of attrition so it's the same thing right that's the same thing with what we ran into in Vietnam we cannot beat them in a war of attrition because they don't care and what do they do they find our weaknesses what do they realize we do care and once we realize we do care cool you can kill 200 of us and we'll kill one of you and eventually you're gonna grow tired of it that's the reality why do you think that vets who came back from Vietnam had such a horrible experience compared to vets coming back from Iraq so you could argue you saw similar things that upset the public right so the public saw oh of course it's always these things are blown out of proportion right because you're seeing a snapshot of something you don't necessarily know that that represents the person that's in front of you now let alone the majority of the people that we're fighting but you had these people coming back from Vietnam that were pariah and fortunately it doesn't seem like the vets coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan were treated that way the vets coming back nowadays have been treated great what do you think is the transition is that a transition in simply the American psyche a little bit of American psyche either Wars for sure but why were the Vietnam vets treated so poorly people hated the war most people hate rack in Afghanistan wars is wild right and I think people have made that connection of hey just because a guy went to fight doesn't mean that their war is on his shoulders now some people say oh that's crap and I hear that all the time like if you didn't believe in the war then why did you go fight right and some people make the distinction of like hey listen this is a soldier out there doing his job so don't get mad at him you ought to get mad at someone get mad at the politicians so I think we people made that distinction and there's some people that still make the distinction like oh if you win fought then you supported the war and you deserve hatred from me because I don't agree with the war but I think less people believe that now or less people act that way now then did during Vietnam I had one seal on my podcast Vietnam guy that was a just a legendary

[00:21:00] Vietnam guy named Roger Hayden who was one of the guys that I looked up to and when I was a young seal he came home and talked about Vietnam and I said what was it like when you came home he's like now no one protested to him no one never saw anything you know and again you're living in San Diego he's a seal you're kind of in a nice little environment but

[00:21:18] I covered another book on my podcast where the guy lost his arm came home to Vietnam he's going to college and like literally gets spit on and so it definitely was a thing but that generally doesn't happen anymore you see it a little bit more you know see some of the radical extremist left-wing people that still might and hold a grudge against the frontline soldier but

[00:21:40] I think people realize that that's not a good target for your anger it's an ineffective target for your anger right and I'm guessing that when you guys were there when you were deployed you didn't spend a lot of time talking about your own political views because obviously you guys are pretty well-informed in fact you're seeing things in person that you can tell people are missing back home right scenarios like actual interactions you know what the insurgents look like and we know what the insurgents are doing to the civilian populace which will change your mindset on what we should be doing so when you when you know that the insurgents have decapitated the head of the household in a neighborhood with five families that starts leave or you know that they skinned the guy alive when you hear that you go okay we should be doing something about this we have some kind of an obligation to help these people that are under the oppressive insurgency that's here and you see a little kid you see this little family it's just trying to live their normal lives than you think we can help them they don't want these insurgents there they hated the insurgents but they couldn't do anything about it and so we can so that does leave an impression on you did you generally feel welcome where you were yes in Baghdad because most of my first deployment I spent in and around Baghdad and my second deployment I spent the entire deployment in Ramadi and the civilian populace wanted us there without question in fact there was a great piece on Vice you know vice news they did this piece when Isis was coming to Ramadi and there was a guy in there and I thought oh this is gonna be an interesting thing because you know Vice is kind of a left-leaning organization and I still watch them to hear what their perspective is sometimes they have a good perspective on things and they did this great piece of this guy who was in Ramadi as Isis was approaching and he was showing all the townspeople and he was showing like the mayor or the governor of the city of

[00:23:38] Ramadi he's on the phone placing phone calls trying to get America to come back please please come back the guys in the streets were saying we hope America comes and you know what America didn't come and Isis came into Ramadi and completely annihilated it we got reports from people that we knew that one there that when Isis got there they went out in had retribution on families that had worked with coalition forces and they ended up murdering about 500 families men women and children what is the presence of Isis in Iraq today nil are they mostly in Syria no they're dead really yes because I had read something quite recently that said no there's a real pocket of they're sort of hiding somewhere but they were killing thousands and thousands of Isis fighters it was a beautiful situation because the Isis fighters became a conventional army for the most part right they got vehicles they had flags they had uniforms so that was their strategic error instead of it being in an asymmetrical situation we were fighting against another army it was like fighting a nation-state yes that was inferior yes yes and so we killed I would say somewhere around 50,000 of them these are black uniform Isis flag carrying took back the city of Ramadi took back Missoula so that's that's what it was if you went back to Iraq today let's say you went with your family where would you want to go what would you want to see again

[00:25:07] Ramadi I'd go to Ramadi then I go to Baghdad have you been there before I've never been to Iraq was surprising about Baghdad is Baghdad was a very westernized city yeah yeah and I mean Iraq was very secular you're from California are you live in California you'd be driving down a highway around Baghdad I mean if it was nighttime you'd think I could easily be on the i-5 hiren in California a guy in my residency program was from Baghdad and also I just my parents being from Egypt they would say look Iraq is by far the most secular wonderful place in the Middle East like such a stark contrast to Iran such a stark contrast for sure him in the 70s even more so so what your parents probably remember is like kind of Iraq in its heyday when it was kind of open and it was doing business with other countries and everything that's you know

[00:25:51] I remember even after the first Gulf War my parents saying look Saddam Hussein is a horrible creature but surprisingly he is not religiously like he doesn't kill Christians he sort of just lets people be sort of religiously what they want and maybe that wasn't entirely correct but their view was he was not as horrible as we thought which again maybe he was I just remember my parents placing such a premium on the fact that he was religiously more tolerant than other leaders in the Middle East now again I think that's always colored through your lens right let's color through the lens of your experience and religious prosecution but it does beg the question which I think most people agree now he was sort of bluffing with his weapons of mass destruction right I mean this was sort of his way of showing strength to his people and potentially to his enemies who he had used him on yeah right so it's like as much as you again this is going back to hindsight's 20/20 well if he's saying that he has weapons of mass destruction and he's certainly used chemical and he has used them before and he's saying that he has them well then it's like okay I guess he has him and there you go but again it just playing these stupid thought experiments it's like if he could have seen how it was going to end wouldn't he have just come up with some sort of solution that's like you know what absolutely yeah let the UN inspectors in of course they would have well at least you'd like to think it was because he'd managed to maintain power in that country for a long time he made some good decisions along the way and he just screwed that one up because he held the line of saying look I have these in their mind and you can't come in here and inspect and it was a bad call good god so what is the future of warfare look like I mean when you think about the fact that we are still at war most people most of us as civilians were just so separated from it we don't remember it we just don't think about it but the lessons of the past 20 years how have they shaped what could be the potential for future conflicts in other words are there people in the military that are spending a lot of time thinking very strategically about what military conflict is going to look like for the

[00:28:02] United States in the next 25 years yeah for sure I mean it's really hard to predict exactly what's gonna be like but let's face it we're gonna have technology we already have drones that are running around can shoot weapons and that's the way it's gonna be right and will we have robots yes we will what's a robot versus a drone I mean it seems like the drones are going to be the more powerful in the air air control so yeah you're gonna end up with drones killing each other and hopefully the drones will all fight the wars and the drones versus the robots will you eventually have all your drones destroyed possibly will you all your robots be defeated possibly and then what do you do you're gonna be human being on the ground the drones really came into their maturity maybe the lot of the wrong word but the drones really made a big step forward in this past decade murdered the past 15 years for sure what has been net impact of that has it been more positive or more negative because you certainly hear extreme stories on both sides right well less people at risk directly but Oh less discernment in the field definitely less people in danger right for the good guys quote good guys what scares people isn't the fact that the drone just is less discriminant in a human I think it's just the fact that it's a drone because that's what scares people hey a machine can come and kill me with no thought no guilt no remorse can just do it yeah that's scary to a lot of people I think it's the way that the future wars are gonna be fought yeah it's interesting because even when you take a step back and ask a broader question which is who will the United

[00:29:30] States be fighting in 25 years let me ask you this so a human being could do a surgery right and a robot could do a surgery the robot can only do it through a surgeon's hands so the surgeon is still sitting there at a console operating which is presumably the same thing a drone is drone is not autonomous right yeah yeah true I guess where I was going with this is it's kind of like with handmade cars versus cars that are made by a machine and everyone thinks that the handmade things are better and the reality is they're not yeah and so

[00:30:03] I've seen some things who was I talking to us talking to someone that said if you don't have this type of technology if you have a human being doing this procedure on you you're in the wrong place maybe it was you that was telling me that well you know what it comes down to it comes down to you have to ask yourself the question what problem is being solved by the introduction of this technology so we love technology right so yeah when robotic surgery devices came along the initial thought I think was this is going to completely replace surgery but you have to take a step back and say well wait a minute there are certain operations for which the robot makes so much sense because there are certain things that the robot can do so much better and you have to pair those things with it so the best example I can think of is probably the radical prostatectomy and the man has prostate cancer and you want to remove it but remove it not by going from the outside of him like not by taking the shortest path of the prostate but by going sort of through the retroperitoneum the abdomen that is such a hard operation to do with your hands which is the way it has always been done and to this day some people still do it that way because it's so hard to see what the hell is going on it's like operating in a deep dark hole that's bloody it's just miserable right well what is the robot do the robot allows you to have much finer motor control and much better visibility well that operation is tailor-made for that but there are some operations like breast augmentation visibility and tactile ability to do the operation are not remotely problematic right it's a surface operation so could you forget self-promotion or whatever say we're doing a robot assisted breast augmentation sure is it an advantage no it's a drawback I guess where I was trying to go with that and I think I might have failed but I mean I think your point is there are probably applications where drones and robots make way more sense but there are probably places where the opposite is true right the point I was trying to make was we inherently trust another human being more than we trust a robot even though the robot might be able to do a better job right I mean if a robot kills someone on the operating table then it's like oh my god how could that ever but we know that the surgeons kill people on the operating table as well and you think oh well it must have been an accident or whatever so we inherently trust that the human being is gonna do a better job then the robots gonna do but when robots do things in combat that get people harmed is it a mistake usually the the human mistake on the other end or is at this juncture yes just like in most cases with a robot surgery it's like a the surgeon put in the wrong input right but in the future it may be that you're actually having this drone make a little bit more of the decision and that really can scare some people

[00:32:55] I think people inherently don't trust robots to make decisions that are life and death ya know like this is not something I know anything about but I love ok driverless cars yeah yeah ok let's just do that one right driverless cars ok which one I'll take driverless cars all day long there you go No and yet when a driverless car gets in an accident it's on the front page right it's on the front page cuz oh my god this thing let this happen what fifty thousand people die every year no it's more than that okay so whatever the number is it's a crazy number I think it's about a little over a million people die a year in the world in car accidents and yet it's like 1.2 1 Tesla hits a wall somewhere cuz the program failed or whatever happened happened and it's on the front page and we don't trust that but we trust a 16 year old example yeah so we can't predict what the world's gonna look like in 25 years let alone who are quote unquote enemies are going to be or what the tools and technologies of warfare gonna be how much time do you spend thinking about the fact that one day you're not going to be around for your kids hopefully right hopefully your kids outlive you you don't know what the world's gonna look like but you want to prepare them to be successful in whatever way that means to you right could be being happy can mean being safe it can mean being productive having us in the purpose how do you think about instilling that into your kids today and so much of what we think of the work you do is with the world's best teams right military business etc but in many ways probably your greatest lessons probably come around a kitchen table well this is why

[00:34:37] I wrote the kids books that I've written it's because the things that I think kids need to know in order to become good humans I put them in those books and they are very clear very simple lessons that are very easy to understand they're timeless and that's why I did it that makes it I had a guy asked me the other day who was at speaking at a company and a guy said you know these things that you talk about they're so powerful and they're so meaningful and these theories and these principles that you live by are just so important what are you doing to transfer these to kids and I was like well luckily you don't know this but I've written for kids books and that's exactly what they are these principles so way the warrior kid it is what are your kids think about because you're their dad right you're not Jocko your dad that's really different and that means that they get pissed off at you and that means that they think you're being unfair at times and that means you notice the hesitation in my voice when I said they get pissed off at me they don't really get pissed off at me I don't impose things that don't make sense on them in the things that I steer them towards they know that they're correct and so you can't get mad at someone for telling you something that's going to help you and I think they've all grown up enough and one thing I was careful as they got older is to make sure that they developed their own interpretation of what I was saying

[00:36:14] I didn't want to impose things because I did that too much when they were little when they were little I forced jiu-jitsu on them too hard and not only that but I made them train I made them compete I made them train all the time I made them compete against people that were older than them bigger than them heavier weight classes more advanced and so it wasn't fun cuz they would get beat and that's not fun and so as they got a little bit older as

[00:36:41] I started to try and actually incorporate the values and the principles that I kind of attempt to live my life by I was careful not to make the same mistake of imposing these things so hard but instead allowing them to discover the principles truths for themselves so did they see in you vulnerability I'm not sure I'm not sure if they do see too much vulnerability in me I think they know that my best friend died last year and they definitely saw that my part was crushed and so I think that was that was probably the time where they really realized dad's hurt he's hurt bad and that's the way it is is that vulnerable perhaps I guess is that me being a human being I guess one of the things my wife talks about with me a lot and reminds me of the importance of is being really good at telling them when I make mistakes and apologizing when I make mistakes which I make a lot of right I mean I make mistakes all the time come home and sort of a shitty mood and take it out on them a little bit and again it's not like extreme right it's not like why come across the head but it's just like welcome across the arm we're just like you know like saying hey how many times have I told you to trim the light off in your room okay well 50 so make this the 51st but was that tone necessary is there another way I could've said it right well the reality was I'm pissed off about something totally different and like being able to sort of apologize for that and that's something that's very new to me like it's something I've never really had much practice in I mean do you think about stuff like that do you feel like to be a good dad I've got to be able to to show them all the times

[00:38:26] I make mistakes and not be afraid of it and let them see that I'm human and that I screw up every day and or do you feel that that just comes naturally to you I guess that's pretty easy for yeah I'm not hiding any mistakes when I screw something up I laugh at it and say wow that was I'm an idiot look at that to me that's no factor I have no ego when it comes to that kind of thing the big joke in my family is that I don't really like technology I don't get along well with printers and things like that so they don't work you know my family laughs at me because I get mad at them and that's the only time

[00:38:55] I allow myself to be mad because it's an inanimate object so I can be mad at something that has no feelings right so I have fun with it so you like that scene in office space I play a game I kind of play it up a little bit that technology bothers me what's my kids see me get mad and yell at my computer and call it names and just have fun with it but now it's no factor to me I'd one thing I think is that people probably have the impression that I'm some kind of tyrannical authoritarian father and

[00:39:20] I'm not it's funny I wouldn't get that impression actually okay well I should rephrase that you might not think that but from the surface when people see me because I look like a serial killer and I was in the military for a long time and all that people think oh this guy must be a tyrannical dad and I'm actually very much similar to well not even very much similar leading a family and leading your kids is the same way you lead an organization the same way you lead a team and if you bark orders at your team your team doesn't like you they don't respect you and they're not gonna carry out those orders with any sort of commitment whereas if you allow them to come up with what the plan is you let them know what the goal is and you allow them to forge what their idea is and what their plan is gonna be they're gonna commit to that plan and they're gonna go execute because it's their plan and so that's the way you should lead your family that's the way you should lead your team that's decentralized command it's one of the major lessons that I learned in my military career and now working with civilians in the minute you decide you're gonna bark orders at people and impose your discipline upon them they're going to reject it and so you've got to be careful about that so let's turn our discussion to a topic that I get asked about more than anything else whenever your name comes up G can you guess what this is gonna be yeah I was following your Twitter in your Instagram when you were asking hey what do you wanna talk of and and what 50% of the people said ask him about sleep or tell him to listen to the doctor Walker

[00:40:43] Matt Walker did talk to dr. Walker and he should listen to that which I got that because he was on Joe Rogan as well and so I got a million tweets about that and I responded that one of the fun ones I had was you need to listen to Walker on Jill Rogan when it first came out and I said I listen to it and if what that guy was saying was applicable to me I would be a hundred and twenty pounds I would be disease-ridden I would be I would be weak depressed and have bad skin that's what he was saying and that's where I should be so well let's talk actually practical so tell me a typical let's not get into jet-lagged or different time zones or stuff but when you're in San Diego what time you typically go to bed go to bed 11:00 wake up at 4:30 okay you go to bed at 11:00 and talk to me about the routine before bed what are you doing when do you stop looking at electronics when are you eating your last meal let's go you get home from jiu-jitsu around 7:30 or 8:00

[00:41:37] I eat sometime after that usually that's my biggest meal so there's another big Jocko faux pas not necessarily we're not passing judgment here I just want a guy eat a big meal then and then I'll do a little bit of work I'll hang around with my kids then I'll do some work and then when 1040 1030 rolls around

[00:41:59] I'll brush my teeth and so you're in bed at 11:00 you fall asleep pretty quickly to fall asleep like almost immediately you get up at all in the middle of the night maybe but not that big of a deal you wake up with an alarm or without I set an alarm if I don't set an alarm but then I cannot sleep at all sorry say that again if you don't set the alarm your anxiety yes okay yeah so you set the alarm for what time 4:30 and how many times do you wake up from the alarm versus 50% and half the time you've just woken up on your own at what time typically between 4:00 and 4:30 okay when you wake up without the alarm how do you feel fine when you wake up with the alarm do you feel any different no how many times a month do you wake up and feel tired I don't know I'm not sure the tired that I know you're not talking about is physically tired meaning I'm sore I'm tired like I know that's not what you mean I know you just mean like oh I'm tired I want to go back to bed yes I don't get a lot of that I'm physically tired and this is something that when I was going to college I was training jiu-jitsu two to four hours every single day in lifting and surfing do whatever but did you get to his hardcore at the time and then at the end of one year or whatever my exams piled up and I had like four days of exams and

[00:43:15] I had to study and I skipped you Jitsu and I'm like the third day with no jiu-jitsu I got up out of bed knows like dude I feel like Superman I wasn't why no why do I feel so awesome and it's because I'm fully rested so I usually feel some a little bit sore in the morning but I don't generally feel like oh I want to go back to bed right now give her nap in the day yes what time it depends if I'm tired a nap I probably nap two days out of seven typically how long is the eight minutes oh so I wouldn't even call that a nap but okay so it's not like a 90-minute nap no no if I take a 90-minute nap I won't be able to go to sleep at night if I take a 90-minute nap I'm up until two o'clock in the morning so the eight-minute nap oh you told me about this once before tell us your routine elevate your feet above your heart and then set an alarm for eight minutes ten minutes at the most maybe twelve but fighting twelve now I feel a little bit when I wake up eight minutes I feel like

[00:44:10] Superman I feel like I just slept for eight hours and you don't consume a whole lot of caffeine you don't drink coffee right you're a tea guy I drink tea when I need it you mean you drink white pee and stuff I mean the Jocko tea which I can't believe I didn't ask you to bring more Jocko too you know I got one for you you did yeah thanks brother

[00:44:26] I [ __ ] love choco tea yeah but you're not a caffeine junkie no in fact caffeine has a pretty big effect on me stimulating yeah yeah yeah yeah like I feel caffeine feel it a lot so if I'm doing a long drive I'm gonna be awake for more than 24 hours and it's nighttime I'll drink some caffeine for sure was this the same in high school I don't really remember let me rephrase that

[00:44:49] I slept just normal woke up in the morning did what I had to do went to bed when I was tired probably slept somewhat similar to the same hours didn't wake up as early but stayed up later it's funny yeah I've tried to remember what I was like in high school sleep wise but I also know I wasn't sleeping a lot I remember what I did like I remember what my bedtime routine was exercise wise and what my morning exercise routine was like and just doing the math on how many hours it would have taken to do this stuff I probably only slept 6 hours a night in high school which I think today

[00:45:21] I would caution against of course if I go to bed early for whatever reason let's say I go to bed at 9:30 I'll wake up at 3:30 that's probably a better answer to your question of how often so basically at 6 hours I'm like it's a normal sleep cycle for me 6 hours and okay I'm up rock and roll you don't have one of these rings do the or ring or any of these sleep tracking devices I do not kind of curious to put one on you would be sort of they're very good at tracking duration of sleep and obviously not entirely accurate on staging but pretty good if you're interesting to see the efficiency of your sleep because I suspect it is efficient if nothing else my guess is it is that is my guess is that when I sleep

[00:46:01] I sleep hard and I'll wake up I sweat a lot I'll have bad dreams and I'll wake up like in a disgusting puddle of sweat sometimes how many times a month with that oh that happens a lot yeah it happens a lot and yeah and actually I got the thing that cools your bed and that helps me yes I have a chili pad Kelly's send me one and that definitely helps a matter of fact if I use that I don't have those things so that's kind of weird I don't know how to explain that yeah I'll have a dream that something's happening and

[00:46:32] I'm running away or I'm pulling myself from engaged in some kind of a combat situation and I'm running out a bore I'm out of bullets like those kind of nightmares and I'll wake up did the exertion that I put out in the dream is reflected in my sweat would I wake up so how often are those dreams about scenarios that are real like that you've seen in the past versus totally contrived first of all I don't remember all of them but I'll remember like that split second when I wake up I'm like aw man I've been running uh oh okay oh yeah yeah this is nasty our mutual friend the person who introduced us is Kirk parsley have you incurred spend time talking about this stuff you know what we only have joked back and forth on Twitter he tells me to sleep more I tell him No one of the interesting experiments that

[00:47:23] Kirk talked about with me many years ago that I'm gonna bastardize it but the gist of it was they basically took a bunch of guys in the military highly sleep-deprived and then put them in an environment where they were forced to be in darkness for some period of time I want to say it was like I think it was like ten hours a day or something like that and the idea was or maybe it was 12 hours of pure darkness 12 hours of light but with no sense of time I don't think they had access to any clock and within two weeks they were all basically sleeping something like seven and a half to nine hours and night even though they hadn't been sleeping close to that in the past so it begs the question right have you done the experiment if for no other reason than just out of pure curiosity to what would happen if you slept seven and a half hours a day instead of six what would be the impact on your memory your performance the closest thing I can say to that is like

[00:48:19] I said sometimes I'll be really tired and go to bed early and I wake up six hours later I will get up and start working because even if I have nothing to do I'll get up and be like okay well I'm not gonna lay here anymore but no I haven't done an experiment like that interesting think about how to do it right you don't want to conduct that experiment by taking a bunch of ambien and sleeping 12 hours because that's not sleep either you've told me before I think at least one of your kids is similar yeah and so this is when people get mad at me which they do get mad at me about they say you're encouraging people not sleeping I'm absolutely not doing that I think people should sleep as much as you need

[00:48:53] I believe that sleep is important that's why I sleep almost every single day that's a joke but um I got if I was drinking from my topo Chico I don't discourage sleep I think sleep is important and I one thing that I've seen is I've seen I've watched people's cognitive abilities go down when they're tired I've seen it I've watched it happen like a guy gets tired and all of a sudden he can't make good decisions

[00:49:19] I've seen that over and over and over again so I know that people should sleep and should sleep as much as they need right that totally agree with that I think that there's a chance that people need different amounts of sleep one of the things that has led me to believe that is that I have four kids each one of my kids has their own sleep pattern that they've developed on their own I never mandated that my kids wake up when

[00:49:46] I wake up or anything my oldest daughter when she was in high school I would go to bed 11 o'clock and she'd be awake studying and I'd wake up at 4:30 and she be awake studying and she would do that all the time and she'd go to school no factor she does not need sleep like a normal person my middle daughter she will sleep until you pull her out of bed she will go to sleep as early as she wants or she can and then she'll sleep until you pull her out of bed my son is somewhere in the middle and my youngest daughter I don't have any judgment about right now so there seems to be some genetic role that is in play here because my oldest daughter barely sleeps and my wife sleeps a lot and I barely sleep so that just may be the way it is yeah I would love to you know I'm gonna be seeing Matt Walker soon and the three of us should just get together and because

[00:50:43] I'd love to propose sort of what are things that we could check in you to make sure they're there okay right just that a like total curiosity right like you know one of the things we talked about on our podcast was a single night of mist sleep would alter the brain's ability to clear amyloid or maybe it was towel but something that was sort of toxic to the brain and you could document this by doing lumbar punctures on patients pre and post and you can have a root canal and we'll follow it up with a lumbar puncture but but one of the things that you propose that can't be discounted right I mean it has to be at least acknowledged as plausible is there have to be differences between people and it's certainly entirely possible that what you need is different from what I need because I've done the experiment right so I used to be the guy that only slept five or six hours a night but when I did the experiment of sleeping seven and a half to eight and a half hours and I the benefit was significant enough that it justified the less time you don't feel groggy when you sleep eight hours you don't feel like slow no you don't feel like a lack of mental clarity no you don't feel like you're physically not at your peak when you sleep that much no now again the challenge that I have is that I travel a lot so I don't have the luxury of being in the same time zone put this way the longest I've been in the same time zone in the past eight years is four weeks

[00:52:04] I'm probably worse than that or at least as bad as that so that interferes with stuff a little bit but when I get those like two-week stretches where I get to be in one timezone and I can dial in same time every night to go to bed same time every morning to wake up I mean it definitely feels good and also I look back at my sort of most unhealthy period of my life when I was overweight and heavily insulin resistant and all of those things and I had historically placed a lot of that blame just on my diet I now believe at least half of that blame belongs on my sleep deprivation sometimes I'll travel and I'll go somewhere and I'll show up and the time benefit is to me and all of a sudden I got all cool

[00:52:48] I can sleep I can set my alarm clock and really tired right now and I'll set my alarm clock and I'll wake up in ten hours and so I'll do that and I'll go to bed and I'll wake up seven hours for eight hours later and I don't feel like I feel groggy I guess that's just jetlag I guess yeah it also might be that you haven't hit an equilibrium I mean I think that would be the question right it's like is there an equilibrium where you got to go through it's sort of a reconciliation period for your body to sort of to sort of get used to it but I mean I appreciate you saying this stuff because there's one question

[00:53:23] I get asked which is like the moment somebody knows I know you it's like when are you gonna talk to him about sleep you're right people get upset about it not I suspect it's because they think that or they're interpreting what you're saying as don't sleep and I appreciate you clarifying that now that gets to a couple of the other questions that I've actually written down from the Instagram stuff which was actually great it kind of worked out it's like a mini Q&A before we've met so I'm gonna just read them verbatim describe a time when you gave up how did you deal with that in the end how did you bounce back how do you tell the difference between giving up quitting versus the smarter calling it quits this is what we've been talking about all day strategy versus tactics you sometimes in a tactical situation have to give up because you've taken the wrong path you've got the wrong plan you didn't suspect something was gonna unfold the way it did and so you have to give up you have to quit on that plan what you don't want to give up on is your strategic goal and so you got to make those adaptations all the time and

[00:54:23] I can give you the countless millions of times that I've said you know what this plan that I had isn't really working out I'm gonna stop doing that plan I'm gonna quit on that plan and I'm gonna go from a different direction cuz I still want to reach my strategic goal now what about quitting on the other side which is quitting in a moment of weakness I don't want to keep doing this even though I should keep doing this if you want to keep doing it why would you stop doing it so I'll give you an example from my life in marathon swimming you are disqualified the moment you touch the boat so and every swim has their own set of rules so I've never been in a marathon swear no matter how much it hurt no matter how miserable I was no matter how cold scared thought I saw sharks where I wanted to touch the boat however there was one swim I did that was actually a relatively short swim it wouldn't qualify as a marathon swim it's called the Chesapeake Bay Bridge swim so it's out near Maryland and it's a four and a half mile swim from one side to the other and you swim between a span two enormous bridge spans and you are disqualified from the race if you can't stay within the current and you slip outside of the span so there are boats on either side of the spans that are there and any swimmer who gets pushed out gets yanked up can't remember what year it was but there was one year when

[00:55:48] I felt like this is my year to sort of be in the top ten like I really felt dialed I trained specifically for that distance which is not really my sweet spot and I had looked at all the times in the previous year I had done well and I was like you know what I'm there I'm gonna be top ten of a race that nobody cares about I couldn't be a less relevant goal here and everyone who's ever done anything knows the feeling of ten seconds and you know it's not your day you know I mean like it's just the next hour and fifty five minutes are going to suck and by the way it's not gonna be an hour 55 it's gonna be two hours and 15 minutes today so I'm a quarter-mile half a mile maybe maybe a mile into this race and I'm feeling horrible like it's just not clicking like I don't have that groove I can't understand why but you know I've had this experience many times before in training so I'm taking a stroke and I'm outstretched so right arm in front left arm in the cat in the high position recovery and the swimmer in front of me not of course on purpose Kicks down really hard hits my arm i sub lex my shoulder so now my shoulder my humerus is out of socket so a miserable day has gone to become now a much more miserable day I put the shoulder back in I do have relatively loose right shoulder from boxing so I'm able to put it back in while treading water but of course it hurts like hell so I now realize you're not going to finish in the top ten dude you're going to just finish and I'm just upset like

[00:57:24] I'm I'm in pain I'm upset I'm just frankly just being a little whiny [ __ ] and so I just got like put your head down and swim just put your head down and swim and what I really remember struggling with as clear as day and this is like 13 14 15 years ago the struggle I had that moment was I wanted to let the current push me out you see in that swim the current is perpendicular to you the reason this swim takes as long as it does for the distance it does is you're not actually just swimming straight you're swimming against the current perpendicular so it's very easy to go out and get disqualified like it just means you just have to stop fighting the current and I remember this was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life

[00:58:07] I just wanted to quit so badly I was like look there's no shame no one will even know did it's a strong current you got pushed out your shoulder got dislocated like just get it over with now I didn't I don't know why I don't think I deserve a hero cookie for not I was like no I just couldn't bring myself to let but I wanted to so badly and I guess that's sort of my story that would be the answer to that question which was that was the hardest thing I ever did and by the way I didn't feel good when I got to the shore you'd think I felt great you did it you conquered you demon my wife to this day still tells the story of how pissed I was when I got to that beach she said you got out of the water you walked past me you didn't even say anything to me you grabbed a bottle of water on the thing and you said let's get the [ __ ] out of here like I mean it was just like again there was nothing beautiful or majestic about conquering my demon on that day I mean I just I was miserable I hated every second of that and but I still remember it I didn't perform there I wanted to going in and then I was just like it's one of these things like I'm starting to blame everything oh this guy kicks my shoulder now I'm dislocated shoulder and I mean yeah you know I just got into this awful negative spiral and then I fought this against myself where I wanted to quit but I couldn't quite let myself and I knew enough to know that if you quit now you're gonna really regret it in about an hour that's fast it says like you might have been test that you got kicked and didn't place where you wanted to place but what you knew in the back of your head is that you let yourself drift out of that thing and that that moment is gonna haunt you for a long long time despite your efforts to rationalize it despite your excuses that you're gonna make and the blame you're gonna cast on everyone else you're gonna know that at that moment you quit and that you knew that in the backyard that's why he swam on you're still pissed off but it guess what you took the lesser of two evils because you washing out of that thing yes you have heard more have you had struggles like that where you really really wanted to just tap out I was paddling out on a giant day in Ocean

[01:00:25] Beach and that's not the San Francisco ocean beach that's the Ocean Beach San Diego I was paddling out on a big big giant day when I was with my best friend and we were paddling out it was a huge giant closeout day of surfing and I was on a pretty big board that was hard to duck dive and I didn't have a leash on which means that you have to hold that thing and get through the surf and I paddled for a long long time and I didn't make us the only time but hang on is that just because you physically couldn't make it happen or did you did you quit well I mean I didn't make it out right I mean I didn't make it out I tried for a long time and I didn't make it out okay but that's like me saying

[01:01:04] Chuck oh I want you to fly I want you to flap your arms really really hard until you get onto my roof yeah well whatever it was it left me with a feeling of defeat and I thought to myself well that was pretty weak but is that any different than not hitting a deadlift rep that you want to hit or a rep count on something okay I'm not sure I guess the reason I bring that up is because you're when did I walk away well like I could have paddled more I guess is what

[01:01:31] I'm saying I mean I could have paddled more I don't know if I would have made it or not I don't wear a leash a lot and that was one day I was thinking I just had a leash because there yeah at least you can just kind of let go your board you can just dive one of the you can swim out and it's fine but when you have to haul that board through with no rope it's kind of a pain and I didn't make it so that kind of feeds into another really interesting question right which was does Jaco understand that others may have difficulty with things that are easy for him here's the problem with that statement the problem with that statement is and this is something that I've experienced with my kids and I've experienced it with other people that are in my life as well which is well it's different for you it's like oh well it's easy for you to get up early in the morning it's easy for you to workout everyday it's easy for you to write a thousand words because you're different and you're you so I don't really like that concept of putting me in some position where I'm some kind of superhero cuz I'm not man I'm not I'm a normal human and here's the dichotomy the dichotomy is I know that I'm not normal I know that I say that but I also know that there's another weird thing going on because okay on the surface the very initial thing you look at me anything call this guy's not normal right then you get to know me a little bit you go yeah you know what this guy's pretty normal like he's a pretty normal guy the thing that is not normal is like the real the deeper level that's where it's not normal that's where it's like mmm yeah I will not stop you know what I mean like there's that little thing in there but I don't overtly run around with that because it's offensive to a lot of people and part of my job has been not being offensive to people and trying to be a part of a team and and have a team and be a good team member and so if you're constantly rubbing things in people's faces that doesn't help your mission you can't bark out your attitude on people all the time because what you're supposed to be doing is being a part of a team so as far as that question goes I know I'm not a hundred percent normal but you know no one's a hundred percent although my reading of that question is I think that person is looking for and again I don't know who wrote this but they're looking for some acknowledgement have you got into the deep discussion with Sam Harris on freewill no we've danced around it a little bit but I'm sure one of the reasons that we really haven't had that does because that's what he does he talks about free will he wrote a damn book called free will so we haven't really had a big discussion about it cuz he'd say hey you don't make your own choices and I'd say well watch this cuz I'm gonna make a choice right now and then he'd say well that choice was based upon your genetic makeup the time you've spent on earth and I don't know I don't know it's such an interesting topic right of all the things that Sam writes about and talks about this is the one that bends my brain the most but here's where I am today I still don't know if I believe in free will I would say this I used to absolutely believe in free will today I'm a free will agnostic maybe

[01:04:31] I'll be a free will atheist actually Sam told me we were talking about what we were going to talk about I think we're gonna do another podcast we're gonna do a live podcast or something and he said I'd really like to talk about freewill and extreme ownership he says because they really align and I was like hey cool I can talk about extreme ownership you can talk about family looks that way I don't have to study and go deep on that subject because to me it's like this call it whatever you want if I want to do something I'll do it and if I don't want to do something I won't do it kind of an interesting concept of course and when you come at it through that lens which is I bet you and I went through the same things like I would come up with counter examples all the time what's like if you told me to walk into a store and pick something out I promise you I have a choice of which thing I'm picking out which is an easier example then think of three movies tell me the first three movies that pop into your head well that one's a little harder right to say that you picked those three movies you know where I've shaken out on this it has given me a little bit more understanding of people that don't share my work ethic that don't share some of the values that

[01:05:36] I have because I think it used to be so hard for me to acknowledge the existence of people who didn't just want to crush it every minute of every day it just bugged me yeah it just bothered me and I tried to separate it from the person but deep down I think I harbored a resentment that I that I think has melted away significantly as a result of

[01:05:57] I think that's a really good point and I never framed it that way but I tell people all the time from a leadership perspective people are the way they are and so that basically is saying they don't have for you will write so I would have to goo that there's and you can have some level of influence on it but you've got a person on your team and they have a certain type of attitude and you can move it a little bit to the left or to the right you can give a little bit of course correction but they're gonna be that person and the only thing that can change them is them so maybe that's where I'd have to push back a little bit because when you meet someone

[01:06:29] I'm sure you've known people I've known people in my life that have radically transformed their life there's been a transformation that has taken place that they went from being one type of person to being another type of person right do you know people like that I mean you can take a person that's an addict this is a really obvious example they come clean okay cool so they've made a radical transformation in their life that's that's good but you can't impose that transformation upon them they have to come to that conclusion that they want to change I was having a conversation with a with a guy that I worked with in a company overseas and he was saying hey and this guy's made some pretty radical transformations in his own life you know he went from kind of being he's opened up a bunch of business he's making a ton of money now he's doing really well and he was not not doing that well before and he said got a new business partner and this one business that I'm doing and can I change this guy can I change this guy I realized maybe I shouldn't partner with him but can I change him and I said no because these are text conversations and I'm your jock I can I said no no and then he replied you changed me and then

[01:07:34] I replied you changed you sure I illuminated the path but she's the one that decided he was gonna change and that's the same thing with his business partners is you can't impose the change on you can show them the path though and then hopefully they make the transition well well maybe that's the answer to this next question that actually dovetails nicely even though it's asked by a different person which is how does

[01:07:53] Chaco work with people who have virtually the opposite mindset so for example make excuses externalize blame others procrastinate how do you work with such people and get the best out of them when you have to the answer is you get the best out of people that you can and when somebody makes an excuse to me you know what I do if I'm working with

[01:08:11] Peter and I say Peter that project didn't get done and I'm your boss and Peter says well you know we didn't get the funding that we were supposed to have and I say okay you know what that's my fault what can we do to get you the funding or you say hey I didn't have the resources that I needed okay that's my folks thank you the research where you say well you didn't give me enough people I say okay well then I need to get you more people or I need to lower the scope of what you need to get done because if you're making a bunch of excuses I'm gonna own them and by the way that goes up and down the chain of command so if I'm working for you and you're not giving them what I need that's my fault too and when you get people together like that that's when people start taking ownership of everything and not everyone is gonna like that some people do not like to take ownership like the person that's being used here in this example is some people will never take ownership of everything because it hurts their ego and they don't want to be blamed for everything and so they just would rather

[01:09:02] Slough it off and what's great about those peoples they won't last inside my organization don't get eaten up don't get consumed and maybe you're in a communistic type scenario or whatever HR is not gonna let you be there's all kinds of situations where you can't get rid of the person because they don't have a good work ethic so then you what

[01:09:19] I'm gonna do it me to get the best I can out of them so I'm going to no you can't fire people think of the difficulty in the SEAL Teams if someone's not doing their job you can just get rid of them no actually you can't and if you do get rid of them guess what you're gonna get for a replacement no one so do you really want to get rid of someone do they have any value that they can add so that's what we're looking to do get the best you can out of people take ownership of things that they're making excuses about and get them fixed I mean the extreme ownership is so disarming that I think that's part of its power right I like who expects to hear that from sure and I'll tell you we've been talking a lot about kids today one of the best things that I figured out with my kids was when they would mess something up instead of me saying you didn't do your homework it was hey I got a call from your teacher and she said that you didn't do your homework again I feel like I'm not even being a good dad because here is the most important thing that you can do in your life is become smarter and somehow I haven't made that impression on you and now you're missing out on simple things that are gonna improve your ability to contend with the world by being the smartest possible human you can be and I haven't done a good job is there anything that I can do that will help you realize why it's so important that you improve your intellect and every chance possible that you get you become smarter because you're gonna be out there in the world one day and I'm not gonna be there you're gonna be on your own and the only way you're gonna be able to survive is because of your brain and right now I haven't done a good job of explaining to you that that's the most important weapon that you have so you'd flip that on them they realize that instead of going into you homework what's wrong with you guess what they're doing they're blaming their teacher they're blaming you they're blaming everyone else but if you take ownership they'll take ownership okay here's an actually an awesome question I would have never thought to have asked you this I'll read it in its entirety and let you answer I really want to know if he indulges ever specifically does he drink alcohol and if he does how often what kind it's always overlooked in all of the interviews done by Tim you and others I'm surprised no I don't drink alcohol okay I don't think I knew that actually I've never been with you drinking so I'd but I didn't know that is that a decided policy like the Jews decide at some point in life I'm not drinking at all when I retired from the

[01:11:30] Navy I stopped drinking I didn't even think about it I retired from the Navy all of a sudden I wasn't hanging around with a bunch of my friends anymore all of a sudden we weren't in random cities out there out for dinner and hanging out in doing that and then I looked up in a month and I looked up in two months and I looked at for three months and that had a beer here and there and that was that so now I just don't drink it all so now his policy like if your dinner and there's a glass of wine being poured you're not gonna have a glass of wine no what is your biggest indulgence then let's start with food yeah yeah yeah I know that's a big list like I really like it let's hear a chocolate dark chocolate what percentage is the sweet spot for you well when you say sweet spot which is optimum for nutrition and health no no no no optimum for indulgence 72% okay 72% and I lied to myself and like you know that's still dark chocolate we know it's not and the way you can tell the way I can tell when something is the right level of darkness is when it tastes good but you don't want more when you get a good for me 82 squares of 80 to 85% and I'm satisfied and I don't even want anymore 72% I want that whole bar and the box that the bar came in dude that is that is a perfect metric for life I completely agree with you by the way you throw me a box of milk chocolate I can eat all of it yes a hundred it's just too dark there's no pleasure in it right but sort of that 85 the 90 for me it's for squares but for squares of that with like a decaf espresso with dinner is like yeah you don't need to eat the whole thing you could nurse that bar for a week yeah yeah besides chocolate what's a true indulgence meaning something that is just patently not great for you in large quantities of just name foods come on it's weird cuz I really love a steak a lot and that's by far my favorite food and steak and chicken and pork and so that's fine but yeah I mean I love [ __ ] normal stuff that people love mint chocolate chip milkshakes used to be a real like I would be stoked and I would earn them I would do something crazy and I'd be like you deserve it and then I ended up making a supplement that's equivalent right it's equivalent to a mint chocolate chip milkshake it's I made that and then once

[01:13:46] I made that now there's no reason to which is which is a crazy thought but yeah the supplements like a sports powder yeah yeah it's called mulk M o with an L K and the reason it's called mocha I made up that word cuz when I tasted it when I got it right I was like this is this needs its own word you mix it with milk or water with milk yeah I mix it with milk I'm gonna order some with water I describe it like this with water it kind of tastes like a ham sandwich like it's good but it's not enough to like really get excited about it's fine but you could do it with like

[01:14:18] I love cashew milk is my favorite type of milk yeah cuz it's fatty and yes cashew milk coconut milk regular milk what's the sweetener you use in it monk fruit oh great big fan of the monk yeah no it's that's the game changer as far as I can tell that's the game ginger and the other important thing is don't overlook alley lows for next editions okay so al ulos actually just approved by the

[01:14:39] FDA two days ago in its citizen petitioned to have the FDA correctly acknowledge it for what it is so al ulos is an enantiomer of fructose meaning it is something that has the same chemical nomenclature is fructose but it has one different position of a bond it's about 70% the sweetness of fructose which is still to say it's sweet but most importantly there are two things one it has the exact same flavor esque and mouthfeel as sugar but here's the best part it's not absorbed it's excreted by the kidneys so for every four grams you ingest only for every gram I'm sorry you're only getting like one tenth of the absorption so if that's not good enough the other property is it seems to drag glucose out with it so when you consume a yellows like for example I have a bunch of it here let's say how to tea or coffee and you put a yellows in it it would lower your blood sugar that's impressive because it's dragging glucose out with it and doing so not into your gut where you get gastrointestinal distress but actually into your kidneys so yeah so it's really interesting and for up until two days ago the FDA was basically calling it basically an added sugar so you weren't getting the quote-unquote credit for it so manufacturers weren't using it much because it showed up looking like sugar so quest I think was one of the first companies to work with this it has a couple of quirks to it for example it gets colored easily it Browns quite easily so if you're making like a white bar you couldn't use it and then I think no Foods is using it so anyway I just saw this two days ago so that's something to consider but monkford yeah is probably one of my favorite of the alcohol sugars and it's the one that tastes ridiculously good yeah metabolically quite inert but uh I'm not a monk I was talking about monk fruit but for that person you know I'm not a monk I'm a human I'm a normal person I like to eat crap sometimes what do you eat typically how many meals a day between zero and two you're not a breakfast guy no so you're a lunch dinner or a dinner yeah mostly yeah what was the longest you ever went without food in combat or in training I don't know probably a few days and then what about these days now how often do you fast probably once or twice a week and then you mean you'll just skip a day once or twice oh yeah yeah and then once a quarter I'll do 72 and I know I owe more than 72 at some point in the near future so I'll be getting some of that mm-hmm it's really not that big of a deal I feel fine I feel totally normal I feel better you know everyone says they feel better you do feel better you do feel better I don't always feel better you know my last fast I did not feel good for the first three days really yeah I really didn't I've gone back and looked and tried to figure out what did

[01:17:24] I do different was there something else going on I can't come up with what it was but I definitely did not feel good for three days and then by the fourth day I did turn the corner he was a bit humbling because I at this point in the game I feel like I'm kind of a fasting jock like it should always be it should always be easy and stuff I still slept really well so I feel fortunate that I using Kirk supplement plus phosphatidylserine

[01:17:50] I have the deepest richest most intense beautiful sleep imaginable when I'm fasting and for that I feel grateful because I know for a lot of people it's really hard meditation feels so much better like a lot of things do get better but the hunger was unusual and this sort of sluggishness not in my workouts my workouts actually feel good but it was just like the kind of ass dragging throughout the rest of the day that was frustrating I really don't know what it was though so I'll be back to it again in a few are you doing them right now I do quarterly quarterly five days five to seven just depending on how long I'm in

[01:18:24] New York for the given we I don't fast here if I didn't just I don't want to do it around the kids and stuff so yeah it's like I aim for seven I usually try to do two the Sunday to the following Saturday if the trip is accommodates it but five at a minimum I think there's benefit at three I really do I think three is a is a real tipping point in terms of glycogen release yeah that's kind of what I'm hearing is that three is like kind of the starting point for the real benefits so I've been slacking yeah but if you can get to 3 and feel good you're really gonna have an easy time getting to five at the end of three

[01:18:54] I'm not oh I can't wait no just sort of whatever in fact the first time I did I remember I was at jujitsu and I had squatted that day I did my complete normal workout showed up but did you know psychologists can hit me and I was training with one of my main training partners and I was like I'm gonna tell you something we're done training and so we trained and and this is a guy that I usually do better than I've been training longer than him so I'm just a little bit better than him and that's the way that role went we trained and I was a little bit better than him like normal and we got done and and he was like what we gonna tell me I was like that I haven't eaten for three days cuz I didn't want him to get the mental advantage thinking like oh if he isn't he needs to be drained I didn't want him to have that so I didn't give it to him or Krita backfired which is a minute in he feels like he doesn't have anything over you he's totally demoralized yeah yeah I don't know that seemed like a bigger risk to take psychologically than him thinking oh he's not eating so I'm feeling good and I'm gonna smash him I'm gonna go actually cuz when people just like in combat just like in life if someone thinks they have an upper hand and they get a little bit confident and then they they can kind of dictate the situation a little bit more than they normally would and this is the type of individual that when I train with him if he tries to dictate that then it can be a little bit problematic for me again

[01:20:09] I've been training longer so it's not you know a total game changer but it'll make things more difficult than they should be so I would rather have him thinking he's on some new supplement or he's got a new move that he's gonna try on me or something I want him to be in that mindset where he's mentally defensive and then when it was over I told him you know said no factor

[01:20:31] I love when my patients fast because I love how empowering it is to them I think the first time somebody gets through a fast whether it's a modified fast or right water fast it's like even if it's tough which you know for many people that first one is actually quite tough they realize like they did it they did it they did this thing man they're a little more in touch with our ancestors like you did something that you were genetically equipped to do you know my kids wrestle and my daughter my son were in high school right now and their season was this last season but I remember my daughter was cutting some weight and you're talking about how to my kids

[01:21:10] I'm not jockle I'm just dad well occasionally they'll let it slip out that they're either listening to my podcast or they're reading my books or some like that and so one of the things that my daughter told me was just she had to cut a decent amount of weight and she's like yeah I haven't eaten in 36 hours and I was like how you feel she's like I feel fine and then she says she's like you know you said in your human being single 30 days about food like you can make it 36 hours do not worry you're not gonna die that's totally ridiculous and so she had the attitude like hey oh my god a three-day fast or a 2-day for 24 hours it's a joke you're gonna be fine it's really no factor well speaking of daughters I see mine walking around out there hovering hovering well I lost her now but I saw her like two minutes ago so she can't be that far so I'm gonna go and get her because of all the questions on her list we have got through all of them but two and I can think of nothing better than bringing her in let's do ask him all right I'll be right back you need to say who you are first my name is Olivia TIA and I am Pierre Tia's daughter awesome what maybe you want to start being more disciplined what made me start to want to be more disciplined one of the main things was when I first got to the SEAL Teams I noticed that the people that were really good at their job the people that were seals that I looked at and said wow I want to be like that guy I realized that what they were doing is they were getting to work early they were taking care of their gear they were putting forth effort that other people weren't putting forth they had discipline and that was making them better and the more discipline they were and the better they did their job the more latitude they had to do what they wanted to do so that was kind of the first connection that I made with discipline making you better and being better giving you more freedom and everything that you did because when I was a kid I was kind of a crazy kid and

[01:23:21] I wasn't always the best behaved kid and sometimes the things that I would do they would backfire on me and so when I got older I realized wait a second instead of doing things that are gonna backfire on me I'm actually gonna try and do a good job and have more discipline and that's kind of where it stemmed from describe what you do during your workouts and what kind of healthy food you eat I do a whole bunch of different things when I work out but I think they're all kind of the common exercises that everyone does push-ups pull-ups dips and then I use weights I'll use kettlebells I do deadlifts I do obviously I do squats because everyone everyone does squats cuz squats are beautiful and overhead squats front squats back squats I do all those different kind of squats I like to sprint I have a rowing machine I have a air cycle I do a lot of burpees it's kind of like there's no secret exercise that I do that's different than what normal people that workout do so how did you get the nickname Jocko okay so my real name is John and my dad's name is John and so I was named after my dad so when you have multiple people in the household with the same name that can be confusing because well when every time someone says John then you've got two people turning their head so when that happens it's pretty common for the son to get a nickname and so my dad wanted me to be a jock you know what a jock is yes yes one that's all into sports my dad was very into sports and he wanted me to be a jock have you ever heard of a magazine called

[01:25:03] Sports Illustrated yes so my dad when they found out I was gonna be a boy he covered my whole room with the cover of Sports Illustrated because he wanted me to be a jock now on top of that my dad is named after his uncle and his uncle's name is John and his last name was Oglethorpe but everyone called his uncle they called him John Oh John oh so when my dad was born my dad was named John and they called him John oh that's what they called him and then when I was born or actually was just before I was born my dad said to my mom I hope he's a jock and my mom said Jaco and that's how they came up with my nickname and it stuck smart mmm about face about faces a book it's a note that your dad wrote down it's my favorite book yeah what's your favorite book way or the warrior cat did I pay you to say that yeah no I just read that last night did you read it for the first time last night no oh really the first one the second one okay do you have the second one no I can't believe I didn't bring that I can't believe that and the third one is coming out soon oh I'll get you that one as well I need to get my hands on some of these what did you learn from where the warrior kid what I learned is that the kid mark he wasn't very disciplined in the beginning but then he got the training and he learned to eating right and he learned how to be disciplined and then he had more sex in school and he was better at all of these things yeah it's a big key to life people do this day say what they want to know what the secret is and I always kind of say that the best advice I can give someone is have discipline because then you'll end up with more freedom mm-hmm I saw that video where it was like a joke and you said if you had trouble sticking to your morning routine oh yeah when I was doing my fake yoga meditation thing that was pretty funny when that happened I was in the studio with these people from CNBC and I'm in there and they're asking me a bunch of questions they want me to do stuff and finally this one girl says hey how do you wake up at 4:30 in the morning and I said oh when I wake up the alarm goes off and I get out of bed and she says no but I think she kind of like cuts like that you know what a toad is like yeah she just you know my editor really wants to hear more detail about that and then I decided to have some fun with it yeah because the reality is what do you do if you want to get up early set your own and when the alarm goes off get out of it that's the way a lot of things are your dad and I were just talking and your dad says something along the lines if we'll you know what about if there's something that you want to do but you know you don't really want to do it was a cool if you want to do it then do it [Music]

[01:27:56] I think that's the best policy yeah thank you thank you thanks for the good questions well my friend thank you so much this was so much fun it's amazing how quickly time can go by and yet there's so many things that we didn't get to talk about that I know we'll continue to talk about but I appreciate what you're doing I really I really do and it's so fun to watch you interact with Olivia I know that half of the interactions the really fun interactions actually have just taken place off mic you know it's you are kind of like a superhero to these kids I think and with great power comes great responsibility it's my favorite line from the whole spider-man movie right I think you've seen things that most of us will never see fortunately and again I don't want to get into the whether it's free will or not free will or how much of this you can take credit for or not but the point is a lot of people come back from what you've been through and they're worse for it and I think not only are you better for it but more importantly you've sort of figured out a way to share it with a lot of people and I feel grateful to be one of them well I appreciate it I can definitely tell you for what you just said there's a lot of people that are scared of what war does to people and they think that war has a massively negative impact on people and

[01:29:08] I can tell you without a doubt I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to serve I'm grateful and unbelievably humbled that I had the opportunity to serve with the guys that I served with and fight alongside them on the battlefield and I know that it's made me better being around people like that seeing what real sacrifices and it's an honor to be sitting here and quite frankly when I hear a little girl like

[01:29:35] Olivia who is she's on the path and just the fact that conversation right there means so much to me and it feels so good and I'll be thinking about that for a long time and it's awesome and I'm super happy and stoked that I get to do this and and again I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for other guys that put down their life gave their life to give someone like me a knucklehead this gift and the opportunity to be here so I'm happy to be here I'm thankful that I'm here and I appreciate you having me on thanks for doing what you do men you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Tia MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what
