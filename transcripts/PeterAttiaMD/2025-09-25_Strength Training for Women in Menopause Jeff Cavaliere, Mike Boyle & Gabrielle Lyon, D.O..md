In this clip, they discuss:

- Strength Training in Menopause – Transition into perimenopause and menopause is a key time to prioritize fitness
- Start Early – Women who enter this stage already fit tend to handle hormone changes much better
- Common Challenges – Sleep issues and tendon stiffness, including frozen shoulder, often emerge
- Role of HRT – Hormone replacement therapy can be helpful for some, alongside training
- Myth of “Bulking Up” – Women rarely gain large muscle mass from training

## Transcript

[00:00:00] sort of pivot and talk a little bit about um strength training women across kind of the transition from pmenopause into menopause. Do you have any experience with that? I'm guessing you do. And Mike, you must just by the fact that they're coming in your So start with you Gabriel. What what do you what are you noticing as the most important things as women are making the transition from pmenopause straight on into menopause? The first thing is to don't don't wait until they start to feel that their body composition is changing. The fitter they are going into pmenopause and menopause, the better they're going to be both metabolically and just activities of daily life, everything. Those women seem to suffer much less. When hormones are changing, I think what I end up seeing is that maybe sleep is poor, their tendons, you know, one of the signs of menopause is this frozen shoulder.

[00:00:56] So if someone is a candidate for HRT, we do certainly believe in that or um menopause u therapy. When it comes to training in the literature, I haven't seen huge evidence or a variation evidence that good training doesn't incl. There is not something specific for women that needs to happen rather than following good foundational principles of strength training, hypertrophy and cardiovascular activity. >> So you don't say, "Hey, now that you're making this transition, we have to alter your periodization or change the way change the amount of time you're spending doing one form of training, say cardio versus resistance or even the number of reps you would do. We're not changing any of that stuff." I don't um one of the things that we do look at though is if they are at risk for injury for tendons or joints because we do see that that changes but then once we treat them um I do not see a reason to change.

[00:01:58] Good programming is good programming. Progressive stimulus is progressive stimulus. >> No. No, it was great cuz when I read your book, it was very reinforcing for me cuz where I'm getting that question more and more now from our female clients just because because of people like you who are talking about it more people are more comfortable then talking to us about it. And it's exactly that.

[00:02:19] It's the whole thing I I always come back it always comes back to strength and conditioning, right? Get stronger, get in better shape, get them to challenge themselves more with weights and not be content. The females are very I always think there's there's an ego component that's absent in females that is very present in in males. Like males will look at, you know, if I looked at what Jeff did, I might think, "Oh, I'm going to try that." Females just don't have that. They're just very internally driven and sometimes that will cause them to underachieve in the weight room because they're not they're not worried about being top dog. They're not worried about who lifted the most weight. It just isn't >> makes them better snipers, you know? >> I believe it. It makes them better clients. Trust me, if I could I would do nothing. I have a lot of really elite females like that are great hockey players and lacrosse players and stuff and they're the best people to train by far because they don't have a lot of the kind of extra baggage sometimes that the guys have. They're just way more compliant. They just listen to what you say. They don't argue with you. They don't again they're not worried about what Jeff is doing. But just encouraging them to continually get stronger and encouraging them to continue to and we would look at it as conditioning versus cardiovascular work. That's just kind of how we always use the term, but pushing them to to do more intervals. Pushing them to do I want more >> aggressive intervals. So, you know, you want to call it a V2 max workout, but >> I want to get that like I loved Andy

[00:03:40] Galpin's idea like Andy Galpin's thing was like, hey, you just want to get your heart rate up really high once a week. >> I think that's a really good concept. And starting to just get people to think, hey, get your heart rate up. Wear a heart rate monitor. Don't be afraid to push your heart rate to uh to X, you know, whatever that is. And don't be afraid to be, you know, out of breath or get off the bike and feel like you want to land on the floor kind of thing cuz we're big assault bike aerodyine people because it's just the I think it's the most efficient way to to hit your cardiovascular system with what I would call no orthopedic cost. Like I can kill you on the bike and nothing bad is going to happen. Even like you were saying with the hamstring, I'm going to bet you can going to be able to bike with that. planning on trying it later today. >> And then you'll be perfectly fine because you're non you're nonweightbearing and you're not getting a lot of aggressive hip extension and a lot of aggressive hip flexion and you can probably torture yourself on there for a long time without having any negative effects. But the biggest thing, like I said, with women is just getting them over that

[00:04:40] I'm going to get big so I don't push myself kind of thing. And so it's funny, I film a lot of my women and ask them to talk about how much they weigh and how much weight they've haven't gained because I have I have two of the best lacrosse attackers on our US team that are in their mid20s now and they've been here for 5 years and they've gained no weight. They're stronger, they're faster. But females gaining lean mass is really difficult. You have to really be a super responder. >> And usually I always say apples end up like apples, oranges end up like oranges. It's not like suddenly one day the apple is going to wake up and the the next day going to be an orange. Like you're going to be if you're an ectomorph, you're an ectomorph.

[00:05:16] You will get the occasional really messorphic female where you do think, "Oh wow, she really does respond to weights." But they're rare. They're super rare. >> So Jeeoff, what about you? What are you seeing in women specifically that you're training, especially during that transition uh through menopause? >> I I think as Gabriel pointed out, like the training specifics are are pretty much the same. what applies and what is good smart training for for men is equally uh applicable to women. Um the only thing that I would say from a a PT standpoint biomechanically there are some differences in terms of something called the Q angle right the the the angle of the hip or the femur coming down to the knee it does create a lot more valgus at the knee for for women than than uh than it does for for men.

[00:06:00] So I think you just have to be aware of those things. So when you're doing certain activities, you want to be able to coach better in terms of being aware of positioning. So like the tendency for a lot of women when they jump is to land in a in a much more vgous knee state, which could put more and more stress.

[00:06:16] And even if it's not, like we're not fearful of them blowing out in a training session. But as we talked about before, that cumulative stress of every time you land, you're getting more and more stress on the MCL or the ACL. That would be something that you'd want to coach around and make them aware of because you could strengthen that. You could work on biomechanic biomechanically improving those things.

[00:06:36] You know, you put a band around their knees and have them jump that way and land that way. They're they're learning how to activate their abductors and their hip. Um, that is probably something that isn't even really a require. We all men could benefit from that, but it's not an additional requirement because we're not dealing with the same biomechanical angles. Also um because of of hormones, women will have more laxity of hormones at different times of the month that will be make them susceptible to different stresses. So I think you just have to be aware of the education side of it and and coaching through that. But as far as the exercises, the programming, um, we also found that, you know, women just tend to be much stronger than men in terms of their their their output pound-for-pound and and given the the differences in sex, they're able to proportionally push more weight, especially with their lower body, than men can. >> So interesting. Yeah, very strong. Much much stronger. Have you found that, too,

[00:07:31] Mike? the the women are are incredibly strong in terms of their their their output and strength comparative to to men. When you >> I really thought about it in terms of pound-for-pound. The one thing we found is that they're much stronger in their upper body than they think they are. That's the one thing that we've seen is that we've got more We've got women doing >> weighted chins with set, you know, 45 lbs for five >> and >> what? >> Oh, yeah. Our best one is the 45 for seven is the best I've seen. >> 45 lbs wrapped around her waist and she's doing seven chin-ups. Alex

[00:08:01] Carpenter, who's my >> How many men can do that? >> Oh, every in our gym we we really emphasize it. Like most of ours >> Wow. >> My son's did 90 for two the other day. He weighs 180. A bunch of kids on his team. We really pushed We push pulling. That doesn't sound right, but we emphasize pulling. >> We like to push pulling. >> Yes. We like to Yeah. That I'm leading the league in redundancy. >> I want to come back to something you said at the outset, Mike. You were talking about kids. The youngest you train is 11. You drew a hard line in the sand. How come?
