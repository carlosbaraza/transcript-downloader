Richard Miller is a professor of pathology and the Director of the Center for Aging Research at the University of Michigan, as wells as a previous guest on The Drive. In this episode, Rich provides an update on the exciting work of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), an initiative designed to assess potential life-extending interventions in mice. Rich covers the notable successes like rapamycin, 17⍺-estradiol, and acarbose as well as notable failures like nicotinamide riboside, metformin, and resveratrol, providing valuable lessons about the intricacies of the aging process. Rich delves deep into aging biomarkers and aging rate indicators, unraveling crucial insights into the science of geroprotective molecules. Additionally, Rich discusses some surprising successes of recent molecules tested by the ITP and concludes with an optimistic look at future frontiers, including bridging the gap from mice to humans.

[00:00:00] to make me happy it has to be an anti-aging drug and the evidence has to be effects on many different age sensitive properties but we have great evidence now for at least three mutants and the calor restriction diet and the methionine restriction diet and we're getting there for rapy and several of the other drugs that came along you know five years eight years after that so I think there will be a very strong case that these drugs are acting by slowing the aging process and delaying maybe not quite all but maybe all of the um aspects of Aging that make people unhappy about getting older hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:46] AA hey Rich great to uh sit down with you again I don't remember exactly when we did this before but I know I enjoyed it thoroughly and it's actually one of the few podcasts I've gone back and listen to I don't often for obvious reasons go back and listen to podcasts that I've recorded because I already heard them but there was so much in that one that I've I've at times gone back and listened to to parts of it so excited to sit down and chat with you again um but uh assuming that maybe people who listen to us in the past or maybe even haven't aren't familiar with the ITP I think it's always great to start with sort of an overview of what the interventions testing program is I certainly refer to it a lot in both um podcasts and and even in things I write uh sure it was uh developed by the national aging Institute under the leadership of Huber Warner about 20 years ago we are just now finishing our 20th year and we've sent in applications so if the peer reviewers like it we may get five more years of funding it represents work being done uh by three different Research Laboratories mine at the University of Michigan Randy strongs at the University of Texas Health

[00:01:55] Science Center at San Antonio and a program at the Jackson Labs where Dave David Harrison was in charge uh David will be stepping down uh next April and he will be replaced by Ron corena uh as the the first uh uh new appointment for the ITP leadership at the Jackson Labs what we try to do is uh quite simple we try to find drugs that will slow aging and extend Mouse lifespan um we have a national announcement every year International anyone who wants to suggest a drug sends us an application and they tell us why they think we should test their drug and why they think it will be good and not hurt the mice we have a committee that evaluates those and then uh we pick five or six or seven each year to see if indeed giving them to the mice will give them a lifespan extension um we've had four published significant hits and another two or three that are significant really small and another two that are in press uh that should be I hope accepted soon so this gives us um a range of successful drugs and we can then and we do uh try again we give them toise at varying doses to see if it's dose sensitive we look at the pathology we make tissues that we can give away to other investigators for collaborative studies and we try to reason uh about mechanisms of aging and control points for aging based upon which drugs work and which drugs don't work a lot of people see this and I can understand that I agree with this as a stalking horse for the important goal of finding drugs that would extend lifespan by slowing Aging in people and that that is an important element but there are many steps between a a mouse drug and a human drug the other major things that our program does is it really gives us a lot of insight into the biology of Aging which um in the moderate term should give us many Clues as to what to look at that may be successful there's a lot in there that I want to kind of talk about rich so I think I'll start with just a couple of simple questions first um in a given year how many candidates do you typically get nominated it varies a lot from year to year um this year was our our winner we had 28 suggestions and we only have enough money to do five or six or seven of them in a typical year it's uh 10 to 15 from which we pick uh about about six annually sometimes we fill up those slots with things that we want to do for instance we found uh a couple years ago that a a drug capap Pro which is FDA approved in in people for blood pressure kind of to my surprise gave a really small increase in lifespan in mice mice don't die of hypertension they don't get strokes Etc so I was betting against that but it was a really small effect so we decided in the current year try cap to pill again but at a higher dose maybe it'll work give us a nice big effect if we use a higher dose some of those slots each year then are taken up with other doses other dosage forms often if a drug works when you give it to young adults we say okay great now let's test it in middle-aged mice everyone would like to know as we would of course whether a drug would only work if you give it to young adults we would love to find drugs that work in middle age as well so that's often fills up one of those available slots well we'll we'll definitely talk about a couple of those drugs um tell me what the budget is what is the Nia provide to the three

[00:05:30] Laboratories they give $1 million a year to each of the three sites in direct costs the actual cost to the taxpayer is probably about 50% more than that because each University will also receive um indirect costs to pay for the building and the Heat and the police force and the library and the president and all of that stuff but it's basically sub5 million a year about 4.5 million total per year of which 3 million actually goes into Direct per year direct cost to each lab yeah yeah so again a relatively poultry sum of money um when you consider the insights that I think come out of the ITP so maybe that's my way of lobbying for the budget being increased I agree I do not think we get too little money yeah the original the first 10 years we had half a million dollars and the

[00:06:22] Nia uh thought of us I'm pleased to say as something that was really working well and doing good stuff so 10 years ago they doubled our budget um which I I think is a sign of their endorsement and their ability to recognize good stuff and it certainly made us feel good what's the and there are obviously 17 instit or 17 kind of Divisions within

[00:06:43] NIH of which ni is one um what is the ni's annual intramural uh and extramural budget yeah I don't know I'd have to look that up it's uh actually one of the larger institutes now it didn't used to be but in in that misleading because more than half of their budget goes to Alzheimer's disease they have um through a variety of negotiations been designated sort of the lead Agency for

[00:07:09] Alzheimer's there are good reasons for wanting to spend money on Alzheimer's research and all of that goes through the National Institute on Aging so their budget is big but their budget for biology all put together is only one sixth of the ni budget and for the kind of biology I care about it's much much less than that uh a lot of the good biology is what happens to Bone aging what happens to eye aging what happens to uh aging of the immune system that's interesting research but the of course the kind of stuff I care most about is aging as a global phenomenon what can you do to slow aging and how is it that aging uh increases your risk basically of almost everything that you don't want to happen to you that part of the Nia budget is small one last question on budgeting um is there an opportunity for philanthropic uh giving to plus up the ni contributions in other words the 3 million in direct costs or the million to each site is there an opportunity for those numbers to go up with donations I don't believe that ni accepts donations however a philanthropist should he or she be listening to this podcast can certainly set up inde dependent arrangements for instance if they wish to have uh support for all three sites in the ITP um one can imagine a situation in which a foundation makes Awards to each of those three the universities do have the flexibility to take gifts and Target them to specific research groups or specific research projects either independently or as a Consortium great okay let's talk a little bit about Mice and Men or I guess let's just talk about mice actually so one of the Hallmarks of the ITP is the mouse model that is used and how it differs from some of the more typical Mouse models that um shall we say run rampant in biomedical research um yeah maybe tell us a little bit about what the standard off-the-shelf Mouse model is where it came from and maybe some of the problems or limitations associated with that 97% sent the last time I checked of requests for Aged mice to the National aging Institute were for the same kind of inbred Mouse it's formal name is c-57 black 6 and everybody calls it the B6 Mouse so um these are the standard Mouse and it's a really bad thing for science not just aging science but science in generally that relies on an inbred Mouse there are several problems one is that it's a single genotype uh and it has been shown many times s now that if you have a drug that works in black six mice it might work in another kind of mouse it might not work it might have the opposite effect in another kind of mouse they're good strong um papers on those issues so people study the black six mice in the mistaken belief that it's sort of like mice in general despite the now really quite convincing evidence that it isn't so the ITP from the word go made a decision it was it it was controversial but in retrospect was a really good decision instead to use a genetically heterogeneous Mouse the particular kind of mice we use is called um 3 umus that's where it was first arrived and head is for heterogeneous these are mice um essentially which have the same set of grandparents so um any two mice in our population have share half of their genes just like you would share half of your genes with a brother or sister but it's a random half so if we have uh two mice we don't know which genes they'll share though we know it'll be half of them and half of the genes will be different the advantage of the system is you can make as many of these mice as you want anywhere in the world at any time and you'll get this year after year after year you'll get the same population characteristics no two mice are identical but all populations of um3 genetically are identical with one another so it's a form of of reproducible heterogeneity and this way if we if we had by chance tested a drug that worked in black six and only tested in black six we really wouldn't know whether it would work in any other stock and if we had tested a drug that failed to work in black six we would have fooled ourselves into thinking that it was a loser drug since there are thousands tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of genotypes um available in the um head three population it's it's really unlikely that one weird genotype would either trick us into believing something to be true when it really isn't or uh trick Us by missing a good response the other sort of ancillary benefit is you can map genes there's a set of collaborators including Rob Williams at

[00:12:17] Tennessee and Johan Al in Switzerland uh which have taken these mice we've given them uh this point something like 12,000 Tales 20 12,000 DNA samples from mice that have a known lifespan and they have already published a paper it came out last year in science and there's another one in the pipeline now that says oh look here's a gene that tells you how long the females will live here's a gene that tells you how long males and females will live here's a gene that tells you how long you live but it only counts if you've made it past the midpoint it only works on the oldest half of the mice all that is very cool science it there are hints to human genetics lying within that and it gives you new tools for thinking about about and then working out ideas about the ways in which your inheritance modifies your aging and maybe even your response to drugs rich I want to make sure that listeners who maybe aren't as familiar with genetics understand the significance of uh the umet 3 Mouse relative to the black uh six so let's again talk about what it means when you have a black six model they are all identical correct absolutely correct but it's even wor than that not only are they identical they are homozygous that means that the gene they got from their mother and the genene from the father are the same so it's like an inbred form of homozygosity that we can't we don't even have a human phenotype that is that inbred right people avoid inbreeding because it turns out that when you inbreed people you get very sick people a lot of deaths a lot of deformities a lot of uh mental uh disabil abilities and that's true of inbred mice as well inbred mice almost always have something terribly wrong with them nearly every kind of mouse that's used in aging research is fully deaf by one year of age many of them are blind many of them get a single disease which is not representative of mice in general yeah so it's it's almost like a thought experiment where you take a small population of people and you make them breed and breed and breed and breed and breed until they all become one person and and then there's two issues one is the probability that that person is healthy is zero and then secondly even if you accept that fact and do all of your testing what is the likelihood that what you learn is relevant to people who are not in breed yeah you can see it in the form of a clinical trial let's say you have a drug you want to test it to see if it prevents cancer in people or something and you decide your test population will be a set of identical triplets Jim Josh and John they identical triplets and you've decided you're going to test it in them people would laugh at you that's not a good design if you want to see if your drug works you sort of have to test it on people who are not identical genetically to one another yet that sort of thing which is so obvious in you know human analogies is ignored by nearly all mouth scientists yeah I guess I I hate asking people to sort of speculate on the the the motivations of others but why does the black six model still exist why is biomedical research being done in this model um if if we have if we want to have any interest in some translational insight you're a scientist you're setting up your own lab your Mentor in her lab she used black six and so all your preliminary data is in black six and so you do black six if you are aware of these controversies you just might say oh I want to test it in some other kinds of mice but then you say no no no my money is limited I I can only afford one kind of mouse I'm going to take the kind I'm familiar with it's like

[00:16:03] Lemmings you follow the leming in front of you because that's just how Lemmings do it they don't look at a road map or think about the optimal path to take they just follow the person who trained them who's following the person who trained them etc etc inbred mice are good for two things um they're almost always sick and if you want to study some kind of sickness Bingo you've got it if you want to study lymphoma you've got some inbred mice that get lymphoma or get blind or get hereditary deafness or something studying inbred mice is great for that the other thing that they're critical for is for transplantation there are a lot of experimental designs where you have to take cells from one kind of mouse stick it into another kind of mouse for that to work both mice have to have the same genotype inbreds are still bad for that the right ones you want to do are the children of two different kinds of inbred mice that's called an F1 Mouse they're better course they live longer they're less sick but that's what inbred mice are good for you can use them to construct real mice like the had three mice they're good building blocks like

[00:17:07] Lego blocks but to do science all them is almost always a mistake all right let's talk about the um the way in which uh a study is conducted so let's not necessarily even focus on a given molecule but there's a candidate molecule that's been nominated the board has reviewed it and decided there's enough biologic plausibility that we're going to test this um let's talk about the metrics of Interest let's talk about median lifespan maximum lifespan what do those things mean are those always the primary outcomes what are some of the other outcomes you consider the primary outcomes the things that we do our statistics on are uh the proportional Hazard that is the risk of death over the whole lifespan which is to to the closest easily understood term is the median lifespan it's not quite correct statistically but nearly always it's a good shortcut to say see this extended the median lifespan by 20% or 5% or whatever the median lifespan is the age at which half the mice have died and half are still alive so if um half of the mice in the normal group um died by 800 days and in the drug treated group half of the mice were still alive on day 880 that's 80 days later then that's a 10% increase in lifespan that that's a that's a a nice big jump we also always calculate um some measure of Maximum lifespan the actual maximum lifespan the age of death of the last Mouse to die is statistically not very useful not valid because it it varies so much depending on the population size and just the luck of the draw what we do is a better way which was worked out by David Allison about 20 years ago um the test statistic we use is we wait until 90% of the mice are dead in both populations the control and the treated population and then on the date when the 90% Mouse dies we say what fraction of the mice are in the treated group of the ones that are alive and what fraction of the mice are in the control group if if we're lucky if we have a good drug um we might have of the mice in that pool population if 80% of them are treated and only 20% are control we know that we have a drug that will uh give you a much better chance of being alive when you're really really old that's the closest we can come to a statistical test for maximum life spin sorry let's make sure I understand that again so you have to wait until in both groups there's only 10% or less remaining because that's obviously going to occur at a different time yes what you do is you you make your list of all the ages of death in both groups yep then you figure out what age is the the age at which 10% are still alive in the pool together and 90% have died in in the total pool I'm sorry SM smush together yeah so there only one age where 10% of the pool is still alive then you look at the pool and say okay well what fraction of those were in the treated group if it's a 50/50 mix you've lost yeah if it's 80% treated and 20% untreated you've got a winner yep uh was there ever a that looked at like the 95th percentile for each group and compared those time Horizons as a surrogate or proxy for maximum lifespan am I making that up it's possible I am you can no you can you can do that you can do the 99th percenti the there a couple of of concerns and they're technical ones one is that the further you push it up 95 99 99.9 The fewer mice you have to work with and so after a while the statistical power drops is you'll miss a lot of stuff if you only have like one or two mice alive at that age we've picked the 90th percenti because they'll still be a few dozen mice alive at that age at the 90th percentile the other thing you want to be really careful of is defining your test uh uh and then picking the test that looks best we could have some groups excuse me actually do this though it's sort of unethical they look at the 80th percentile the 85th the 90th the 95th and then they say oh it looks best at the 90th let's pick the 90th that's not a good thing you will fool yourself you'll get false positives and so we

[00:21:37] Define arbitrarily 90th we're going to do it at the 90th percentile all the time yeah and so in other words it's sort of pre-specified yeah yeah oh AB right it's pre-specified it's written down before we do any test in fact it was written down 20 years ago do you come up with a new power analysis for each experiment or do you generally power them the same and therefore have the same number of mice in each

[00:22:02] ITP yeah we use the same number of mice in the control group and the same number of mice in the treated group each and every year um before we start of course we don't know whether it'll be a good year or a bad year some years the mice live 5% longer or shorter than in previous years and we also don't know which drugs will work and the ones that do work we don't know how big an effect they'll have so what we've done is um with the assistance of two professional statisticians and again this was 21 years ago we worked out the number of mice we want to have in each group and our Criterion is we wanted to have at least an 80% chance of picking up a significant result even if one of the three sites had a disaster like an air conditioning failure or a viral infection so far we've only had something like that happen once but um we said let's be ultra conservative we want to have an 80% chance of picking up an effect that's at least a 12 12% effect up or down a two-sided test even if only two sites survive um so that we use that amount to determine how many mice we're using now in practice almost always we can combine all three sites together we almost never have a sight specific disaster and that means in practice that we have 80% power to detect drugs will give us like an 8% increase or a 10% increase 12% was kind of conservative and what does that amount to in total mice usage typically for for a given drug so at each site we are using 100 male controls and 100 female controls so pooling that's 300 males and 300 females in the control group each year and for each drug we use 50 males and 50 females that is half as many as the controls again at each site so for any one drug 50 * 3 is 150 we have 150 male mice distributed across three sites and 150 female mice distributed across three sites we over sample the controls that is we double the size of the control group because we're going to compare controls to drug a controls to drug B controls to drug C so in a sense we're reusing we're getting our best mileage out of the controls since uh we can increase statistical power for every one of those pairwise comparisons by adding extra mice to the control group so we do it that way in other words if you're doing a five drug trial there will be a total of 300 male 300 female control but there will be 750 total male 750 total female on the combination of drugs 150 for each yeah seven drugs times 50 is 350 mice getting some drug yeah uh male mice getting some drug oh I thought it was 150 male and 150 female per drug across the three stes oh yeah you're right I was talking about one site three sites you're right it's 150 times the number of drugs okay um and then how much you've done this for now nearly 20 years what is the range or variability in lifespan both median and maximal for the controls we got something we didn't expect to see but we've seen it almost every year for the last 20 years um we were hoping that the three survival curves that is one at each site would always be superimposable course we're all really good at taking care of mice and for females that was correct each and every year the Michigan Texas and Jackson Labs female survival controls are almost always superimposable there's been one year 2017 where that was not the case but most of the time it's the same for males however there is a persistent and consistent difference which we really do not understand males at Michigan always live 5 to to 10% longer than males at the other two sites that's unexpected and problematic and we really don't understand it maybe it's the water tastes funny or there's some smell that the mice can are obsessed about that we don't know about or there's um some contamination in the Sonic environment that is sight specific no we've tried to do everything we can to eliminate it and we have failed we also know that there are sight specific differences that are read out as weight and here it works in both males and females the Michigan mice are always controls are about 10% lighter both in males and females than mice at the other two sites so despite our best efforts we get the food from the same place the bedding from the same place the mice from the same place we breed them in the same months trying desperately to get them to come out the same way in all three sites and it we we gotten close better than many people would do but not perfect and particularly for the survival Curves in males there's been a consistent sight specific difference so it's interesting that both the males and females at

[00:27:16] Michigan are 10% lighter presumably they're eating less or moving more yet it only translates to a survival benefit in the males and not the females you have the fact's right it's the causality that's uncertain we don't know whether the difference in survival in the males has anything to do with what's causing the weight difference we see them both just as you said y we don't know whether the changes in weight contribute to the changes in survival or whether it's just two independent facts the the observation that the females are lightweight too despite the fact that the female survival curves are superimposable suggest that it's not something simple like that now does that allow you to still pull the results for the males yes but we do it with a a very standard not not esoteric statistical trick we we site stratify that is the survival curve for the Michigan males controls is compared to the survival curve for the Michigan drug treated mice and the survival curve for Texas controls to the Texas drug treated mice

[00:28:22] Etc and then what the statistical program does is it pulls the those three uh sets of results to come up with one overall statistic in every paper we also report separately here's what we saw at Michigan here's what we saw at Texas here's what we saw at the Jackson Labs but our primary hypothesis the thing that allows us to put the name of the drug with the word winner in the title of the paper is the pulled result in which the uh results have been stratified and we stratify the the test for maximum lifespan the Wang Allison test we adjusted that to make it stratified also how much complexity is there year after year drug after drug to create a good formulation of the drug to give the mice how are you thinking about the dosing frequency the dose itself and how to ensure that the animals indeed get the amount that you want yeah that's a a very good question and we've put a lot of effort both in planning it and then executing it the University of

[00:29:26] Texas uh is led by Randy strong who's a pharmacologist and he has a a colleague it used to be Marty javor and now Brett Ginsburg has taken over that role who is a uh devotes a lot of his time to asking exactly that sort of question so for example we before we give any food to mice we make a batch of food with drug in it and Brett's lab takes it and measures the amount of drug in the food and if it's 5% of what we thought it would be something as GL Rog and so we try to work out and this is again Brett is an expert at this should we dissolve it first in alcohol should we incorporated in the form of a corn oil suspension what's the best way to get it into the food so once Brett with the uh involvement of Peter rif Snider who's uh who who runs the lab at the Jackson Labs one Brett and pre Peter have shown that they can make food with the stuff in it and is at the right dose we then give it to mice for 8 weeks and tissues from these mice then go back to Brett so

[00:30:30] Brett can say yep the tissue of the drug treated mice has this amount of drug in the liver and this amount of drug in the plasma so it's only at that point that we actually press the button to say yes we are going to use this drug in a lifespan experiment those pilot mice my lab gets their liver and we look at a batch of mrnas because we want to at least satisfy ourselves that the drug did something we've picked rnas in the liver that we know almost always sensitive to drugs and if the drug was given to the mice and nothing happened in the liver we start to get worried maybe the drug was excreted quickly and didn't have any biological effect whatsoever and we've run into problems I mean the famous One the early one was rap ayin about 90% of the Romy that was given to mice in the food never made it into the mouse because it's digested in the stomach and the acid conditions of the stomach it gets degraded and so

[00:31:26] Randy with colleagues of his uh worked out a way to encapsulate the Romy in a capsule plastic capsule that makes it through the stomach and dissolves in the more alkaline conditions of the small intestine so that was a way of tricking the body into getting the ramiz into the portion of of the GI tract where it could be absorbed and uh it's not uncommon for Brett to have to say well you know this is not going to work unless we dissolve it in a little bit of alcohol before we mix it into the food so we do test for that these are all important issues the other thing that the uh the data on blood concentrations they can alert us to potential problems um for instance many of our papers we published

[00:32:09] I think 12 papers now on Rapa and and almost always Rapa has been giving a larger percentage increase in females than in males well um the Texas group showed that the blood concentrations are three-fold higher in females than in males we haven't proven that that's why the females live longer or have a greater percentage increase but it's certainly very plausible we've stumbled onto a similar situation with

[00:32:36] Kagen um kagal floen we found gave a terrif this is published a few years ago lovely lifespan increased but it was in males only not in females which is really weird because it's a a great drug for diabetes in male in men and women without sex differentiation we thought it would work great in both sexes well it it turns out that the blood con concentration in female mice is three times higher than in males and as they get older and older and older it the the blood concentration in the old females is 10 times the concentration of young males and it's probably toxic um with we now are going back to say okay well let's give it to females at a much lower dose maybe that'll work or let's give it to females but stop when they're middle-aged so it won't ever reach the really high toxic concentrations all of these assessments of drug levels allow us to be on the alert for problems of that sort and to come up with ideas uh for how we might solve them rich I assume it's the case that every candidate drug must be administered in the food you're not testing intravenous drugs into muscular drugs yes this is correct there's a footnote which I'll get to we could give a a drug in water if there was some reason in which it wouldn't get into the food but you could give it in the water this would be compatible with our protocol we can't give it to animals intravenously or intramuscularly because it's so much work to give we have you know 150 males 150 females giving 300 shots a day or a week or a month would be a mess in addition to which we'd have to have a separate control group that got a sailing shot and we couldn't use regular old mice as our control we'd have to have a separate control group to do that you can imagine a specific situation if someone said I've got a an antibody or something all you really have to do is give it to them once and it will flip their immune system forever into a good configuration please give my drug has to be given by injection but only one time we could consider that we might need a separate once only sham group also but I think that's the only exception to the rule that we would think seriously about okay final question on that um again just a folks understand how are you regulating the actual dose in other words how are you monitoring the amount of chow that's consumed since the amount of chow that's consumed is proportional to the drug that's consumed we have no idea how much food any one Mouse eats and therefore we have no measurement on a mouse by- mouse basis on how much of the drug they've consumed we know of course that smaller mice eat less food than larger mice and so they will get less drug per Mouse but probably about the same amount of drug per gram of lean body mass or something like that um there's no way to control that other than by putting individual mice in individual cages which has its own major problems there the mice are very social creatures and they don't like isolation cages any worn people do and uh in addition monitoring the actual amount of food a mouse eats is a fiction no one can really do it um they they can put a number down and get into the paper but it's it's a fictitious number and the reason is that mice chew their food and leave a lot on the cage on the floor of the cage so you don't know how much food the mouse has actually gotten into itself because you haven't measured little crumbs on the cage floor in total how many drugs have been uh run through the protocol in the last 20 years uh I I would have to go to our recent review article and then add some more drugs to it's about 100 yeah and of course many of those you've already alluded to this have been run through multiple times so that there are many more experiments than a 100 um but to the point you made at the outset there really are some notable successes I want to talk about those I also would like to talk about some notable failures um but let's let's start with the successes so what was the first uh exogenous molecule that proved a lifespan extension success for the ITP yeah well Rapa uh in in our 2009 paper had a really big effect uh at we picked a dose um that seemed like it it might work and it did it's not the optimal dose it's less than the optimal dose but it's the dose we chose both males and females had a significant lifespan extension to put this into perspective these drugs are giving like 15 to at at the M middle dose 15 to 20% increase in median lifespan to to give a sense of what that means if you had a cure for cancer in people no one over the age of 5050 ever got cancer again median lifespan of humans would go up by 3% and the same is true if you had a drug that abolished heart attacks no one over the age of 50 ever got a heart attack again uh median lifespan for people would go up by less than 3% that's work done by Jay olshansky and Bruce KS and published in science in 1990 so the drugs that we consider you know we have four of these now that give more than a 10% increase in lifespan in terms of proportional change of healthy lifespan are doing about three times better than some hypothetical drug that abolished cancer in people or abolished heart attacks in people so there that's a really significant chunk of additional uh healthy lifespan rapy um in that first paper was also the first drug I believe where anyone had showed we we found that it works quite well even if you start in really old mice some of the mice that were exposed in that paper didn't start until 20 months of age where the median survival is about 24 for males and 26 for females it took me very much by surprise we thought only drugs if a drug was going to slow aging you really do have to start it when you're young because a lot of Aging is what happens between the ages of 20 and 60 or something like that as everyone knows so it was stunning that a drug could start as late as that and still have a full lifespan benefit that's really was news scientifically and I think that's one of the reasons why the editors of nature were interested in it but that turns out not to be a fluke um 17 alestra Dial which is male specific works just great if you start it at 16 or 20 months of age in the males a carbos which is significant in males and females though better for males if you started in middle age it still works it's only about half as good starting early is smart for a carbos but even if you started at uh 16 to 20 months of age it still works just fine and um canag

[00:39:33] Flo and are data in in that group um haven't been published yet um for males it's still terrific for females as I mentioned it actually isn't good but we suspect it's because the the drug dose the drug concentrations in the blood of females may be toxic so we really want to do that again but with lower concentrations of the drug do you have a sense of why rap Amy and kagaoan are being more concentrated in females and are you seeing that with any of the other successful candid drugs such as uh can such as a carbos for example or 17 uh beta estradi 17 Alpha estrad sorry that we don't know the answers for any one of those drugs it wouldn't be too hard to find out you know a pharmacologist could look at how quickly is absorbed how quickly is it conjugated how quickly is it excreted does it go out in the urine does it go out in the feces all of that there're very standard 50-year-old methods for answering that question and you know it's I think would be important to address there's a generic answer which is really quite firly established the enzymes that the liver uses to deal with foreign drugs these are called enzymes of xenom xenobiotic metabolism xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes are radically different between men and women and between male and female mice most of them not all but most of them are a lot higher in females but some are a lot higher in males and this is also true for people so the pace at which drugs are conjugated put into the bile or put into the urine or excreted in the feces or excreted in the urine very often are sex specific um it it's would not it's not it doesn't surprise anyone to find that the blood concentrations may be different in men and women or different between uh male and female mice the details on a drug by drug basis we haven't looked at yet the the one thing

[00:41:26] I I would want to um add here as a footnote is for AC carbos it has nothing to do with that AC caros nearly all of it stays in the gide it doesn't get absorbed into the body so excretion is not the key issue um why the acaros has such a big effect in males and a small significant but small effect in females is unknown it presumably has to do with males being more sensitive to high glucose levels a carbos probably works by limiting very high glucose levels maybe for unknown reasons that triggers something horrible in the males and not so much in females Rich when you talk about the difference in the pharmacokinetics between male and female mice we can only extrapolate and say that our you know cytochrome p450 system as humans must have sex differences oh yeah that's well documented absolutely but what I can't tell you for the life of me rich is one drug that I'm aware of that we really differentially dose in males and females Beyond a weight difference in other words we don't seem to take into account that difference when we give a person an antibiotic or a

[00:42:39] Statin or a chemotherapy they're all based on either weight or nothing at all and yet if I guess what I'm saying is I'm this is kind of remarkable to me that we don't have a better set of the pharmacokinetics of these drugs and their differences in human sex and how that maybe should factor into how we think about dosing them I would love to see you have on your show a real pharmacologist who knows the answers to that question I would love to talk to a real pharmacologist and ask him or her hey aren't there differences between men and women in the rate at which drugs are excreted and why isn't that informing our recommendations for drug Doses and people I think it's a really good question but I don't know the answer okay well let's that's something we're going to have to dig into a little bit because it seems like um an enormous missed opportunity to get that level of granularity um you've rattled off a bunch of the successes I think it's worth a bit of a double click on each we can take them chronologically so again people who listen to uh this podcast are are very familiar with Raa mice and recently had David sabatini and Matt cllin on together so we did a pretty good Deep dive on on Raa um but again just on the off chance that someone's coming to this as their first exposure to rap a mice and uh do you remember who made that nomination for the 2009 paper Dave sharp okay so came inhouse almost um and the um obviously the the logic at the time was what I mean it was a you know 10 years earlier the drug had been approved uh by the FDA for uh solid organ transplants and yeah um so it was a known immune suppressant um what was the logical step that took it too but we also think it could boost longevity people had just begun to make invertebrates that is worms and flies with the genetic modulation of the tour pathway tour is the target of rapy and the enzyme that rapy inhibits and you know they were long lived and in fact when you studied some of the yeast stuff that Matt cabine was was in on this early on with Brian Kennedy many of the um things that seem to influence yeast lifespan were also related to the tour pathway so Dave said I wonder whether if you inhibited T in mice they would also live longer it really didn't have to do with the notion of immune suppression it had more to do with control of growth and following up on the genetic data in the invertebrates now in retrospect 20 some years later um we understand that the notion of Ramy as immune suppressant um is the sort of tip of the iceberg there are some immune functions which it increases there are some that it decreases it's dose dependent and context dependent by an interesting coincidence uh the same year that our lifespan paper appeared there was another paper where rap also from

[00:45:45] Michigan though not my lab at all in which they gave Rapa M to some old mice and shown that their influenza vaccine response was terrific if they'd had Rapa what rap mice and appears to do in their model is increases the production of B cells from the bone marrow so the mice would respond to influenza vaccine and then they were exposed to live virus and they surviv whereas the UN untreated controls did not survive so in some circumstances at least it's actually immuno boosting and that was also demonstrated by Joan manik and Lloyd klickstein six years later um using everol it improves that's right in humans it also improves uh vaccine responses on some circumstances to influen in vaccination in humans yeah so you've already alluded to this but I think it's again just worth making sure folks understand this you had a little bit of a challenge getting the rap ay formulated uh why did you decide not to abort the study when you finally got the food formulation done you've got these geriatric mice you finally get to start feeding them Raa I mean obviously Chance favors the prepared mind according to someone famous um you elected to take a chance uh do you remember the the decision I mean the odds were long right there are two decisions step one was Randy Strong saying I'll bet we can get this into mice I've got buddies who do encapsulation let's encapsulate it and see if that stuff works so Randy's initiative and creativity were a a the first important step now we have a batch of mice they're uh 20 months of age they were orally going to get rap ay when they were four months of age we could either a throw them out or B give them the rap ay so we picked be we were sure it wouldn't work now we were wrong so when Randy finally with his colleagues figured out how to make the protected version the encapsulated version rapid mice and we actually used it twice the same batches some of it went to the mice that were already 20 months of age so we wouldn't have to throw them out and then we executed we gave the rest to the young mice that had been produced in uh the following year um expecting that the old mice it would fail the young mice it might work and as as you know it worked well in both ages what was the difference between the uh male females in the 20mon onset versus the four-month onset both by sex Scott Pletcher actually did that analysis that when you compare within sex so you're comparing older females to younger females there's no difference surprising L the benefits you get starting in old age and the benefit you get starting in young mice is statistically insignificant in females and it's statistically insignificant in males in both sexes starting as late as 20 months of age does not diminish the um uh ability of the drug to extend lifespan this is just really remarkable what what I mean let's let's try to philosophize a little bit about what that tells us about the biology of Aging or does it tell us more about does it tell us more about aging or does it tell us more about the drug well I think it tells you something about both about the drug and its interaction with the aging process the the sort of inevitable conclusion which I would have bet a lot of money against is that by the time you're 20 months of age in a mouse which is sort of like 55 or 60 years old in a person something like that not yet at the median survival but getting pretty close that's damage will have occurred that's irreversible collagen cross-linking and death of some brain cells and uh clogging of the arteries or whatever is going to get you it started already by the time you're in your 50s and 60s or for mous by the time you're in your 20th or 21st month but apparently there's still some further stages of that process that occur afterwards after we started to administer the drug at 20 months of age which are dependent on aging and the drug inhibits so that's the news that we would not have known if we hadn't done an experiment starting in late middle age now what those processes are whether they are same processes as affected by many different drugs that's unknown um if we have time at some point to talk about these new aging rate indicators uh that has come out of the ITP program we can begin to ask questions about whether the

[00:50:22] Aging rate indicators are effective in the old mice or the middle-aged mice or the young mice um clearly we've got a lot to learn now about what is happening that is drug sensitive even in middle-aged mice the fact that a carbus Works half as well in middle-aged mice canag floen works at least in males quite well in middle-aged mice which is unpublished and that 17 Alpha estradiol works great even in middle-aged male mice suggests that it's a general phenomenon it's not Rapa and only uh but it applies to a lot of phenomena Mike

[00:50:59] Garrett when he was in my lab he's he's now set up his own lab uh in New Zealand but he took a lot of mice and he put them on um 17 alester Dial or a carbos in middle age and he found and this is all published that their grip strength is great much better than untreated old mice and their ability to stay on a rotating Rod which is a complex phenomenon having to do with balance and muscle strength and motivation that is much better even if they started the 17 alestra Dial or a carbos in middle age it's not just a matter of the things that are going to kill you these mice don't die of dizziness or loss of grip strength or something but a whole batch of stuff uh that is is age sensitive is slowed by these mice the next Frontier that I really want our lab and other labs in the ITP to dive into is cognition of Michigan has just recruited an absolutely top-notch Mouse neurobiologist woman named Katherine kerosi and we already have several studies planned or underway in which we're going to be treating mice with these drugs and in addition to looking at their lifespan test them for cognition the obvious hypothesis is that the drugs that's extend lifespan will also postpone loss of cognitive function for complicated reasons kather thinks that will be untrue and I think it is true so we'll see which of us is correct what other measures of Health span are you capturing obviously cognition is a piece of Health span but you already mentioned grip strength and then some Complex

[00:52:37] Motor tasks and some complex stamina tasks um do you look at for example muscle mass at the time of demise in these mice though it's you know not a direct uh driver of Health span it's a highly correlated driver of Health span I mean what what else can you say about these mice and their health Beyond just the elongation of life right so we we have um uh stage one and stage two studies in a stage one study which we do for every new drug lifespan is the only thing we measure in addition to body weight at four ages we could throw in other tests but it's really expensive to do that and to standardize it so that all three Labs get the same numbers proed to be really tricky so if we did devote lots of efforts to looking at these sub secondary measures of Health in addition to lifespan we would test only three drugs e four drugs but once you've got candidates I mean yeah once we've got candidates yes then we go into stage two every drug that makes it to stage two we develop a protocol that takes advantage of the strengths and weaknesses and interests of each site so uh Dave

[00:53:49] Harrison for instance had many tests of visual Acuity hearing Acuity uh strength uh body temperature regulation so the stage two experiments at the Jackson Labs Incorporated many of those tests Randy strong and his colleagues were interested in glucose control and glucose homeostasis so the stage two stuff that was done at Texas always had some taste of that my lab is interested in pathology so we would take a lot of these stage two mice euthanize them at 22 months of age send them to a

[00:54:20] Veterinary pathologist and come back with a long list of here's what's happening in the liver but look it didn't happen in the drug treated mice here's what's happening in the gut but look it didn't happen in the drug treated mice so our other hope of course is that once we have a winter the Laboratories that have a specific interest in aging of the aorta and aging of the heart and aging of the lung and who know what they're doing will just ask us for tissues um either they can buy the drug and treat their own mice hopefully not black six but they can treat sub mice like het three mice with the drug and test their organ specific uh functional or pathological outcome tests or if we have tissues in our freezer they can ask us for tissues um we since 2015 every drug whether it's a winner or a loser we've been putting aside 20 or 30 or 40 mice to be euthanized at age uh 22 months and Frozen and anyone this is changing next year I'll get to that in a minute but anyone who wants those tissues just writes us a note saying here's what I want uh this is the tissue

[00:55:29] I need here's what I'm going to do with it uh here's my power analysis and we just send in the tissue uh it's clearly a national or International resource we've sent tissues overseas to other labs um to make use of tissues that have tons of useful information in them but um we can't study everything we can hopefully attract the interest of people who can study everything this uh program which we call CIP the collaborative interactions program unfortunately I think is going away next year the national aging Institute has decided that instead they want to replace it with a new program which they're calling the um uh uh Interventional biogerontology repository in which the the tissues will not be requested from us they will be requested directly from the national aging Institute and the national aging

[00:56:22] Institute will make all decisions as to who gets the tissues who doesn't get the tissues how much tissue they get um I'm not so sure that's a grand idea but the worst thing is that they will have only once a year uh call when people send us a note we generally can make a decision within two or three weeks and they can generally get the tissue within a month or two uh adding an extra year of time for the

[00:56:49] Nia staff to sort of figure out who gets the tissue or not is not going to speed things up so I I view that as a step backwards but I'm not in charge of it rich based on these um tissue blocks what have you learned if anything through collaborations with people looking at epigenetic changes in the treated versus untreated mice I mean we have to imagine that there's some difference in gene expression and that would be at least one way to look at it correct yes that is one way to look at it um and we have indeed you know there are some Labs Steve horbath I think is is well established and does lovely work um Steve has asked for tissues and we have sent him tissues and we've explained to anybody else who is working on some aspect of either Global or localized tissue specific epigenetic change we' be delighted to send them tissues uh to look whatever I know Steve has done some of that work I think some of our uh drug treated mice have gone to him um Vadim Glades shev has gotten lots of at Harvard has gotten lots of tissues from us and has published metabolomic assays for instance I don't think any of his epigenetic stuff has come out yet though I'm not certain of that the paper that Johan aars just published with Rob

[00:58:08] Williams and uh maroon bu slayman in science had some epigenetic materials in it the problem is that no one at this point knows enough to know what tissue to look at so um it maybe that a particular drug is working because it sensitizes the liver to high glucose levels or something so you'd want to then look at liver tissue or pancreas tissue or isid tissue or fat tissue or quite plausibly tissue of some obscure cell type in the hypothalamus which regulates uh uh uh the um hormones that make you hungry or not hungry and sort of doing I'm I'm going to guess that I'm the liver is important I'm going to look at all the epigenetic changes in the liver is a very crude way of addressing that in my view the progress will come when someone says hey look this drug works by hitting this enzyme in this set of hypothalamic neurons now let's look at the epigenetic change in those neurons but we're we're not there yet so you've already alluded to the Aging rate indicators um say a little bit more about that and and how that's factoring of the work everybody is familiar with the idea of concept of biomarkers of aging and by analogy it's sort of like the odometer in your car your odometer tells you how far the car has been driven and a biomarker of Aging in a crude sense tells you how far your body has been driven if but what what would you say they are rich I mean like what what biomarkers do you think we really have of Aging what what are the odometers yeah that's a whole separate complicated issue I B personally don't think we have very many at all yeah I would agree with that I don't I don't even think we have the odometer so I'm

[01:00:00] I'm but yeah there there I agree with you but conceptually um you can imagine if someone comes into your test facility and they've got a lot of high Affinity antibody and their vision is terrific and they've got no cataracts and they're great at hearing and they can do a 100 push-ups and they're great at running up and down a hill and their skin is smooth etc etc all 10 or 20 domain they sort of look like they're 40 you could say okay they are biologically young that's a yeah yeah although although it's a bit I mean you know I put that in the realm of function right so I agree we have lots of functional tests that give you odometer like insights um yeah but when you when you think about a biomarker that is assay based I think we're both saying the same thing I share that there's nothing there yeah yeah I wasn't I wasn't um attempting to to praise uh um biomarkers aging I'm wanted to set that up as a familiar concept you know because I mostly wanted to say that aging rate indicators are not that aging rate indicators by this analogy are the speedometer they tell you how quickly you're aging and not how far you've gone so what we were looking for and I'll in a moment I'll tell you the evidence that we think suggests this is a good idea we were looking for things that always change in the same direction in every kind of slow aging mouse that would distinguish not how old they were but how rapidly they were going to be aging so um we have nine published and one unpublished slow aging mice we have four genetic mutants the

[01:01:42] Snell the growth home receptor knockout the as dwarf and the Pape we have a famous diet calorie restriction and we have at least four well vetted drugs uh a carbos kagos and 17 Al estrad and rap a so we we said let's find something that is changed in the same direction in all nine kinds of mice and this is true for a tenth kind P10 ere expressors though we've just submitted that for publication so the next time we talk we'll have at least 10 mice for which these things are true and the pleasant surprise is that we now have 13 things that always change in the same direction in all 10 kinds of slow aging mice even when they are young adults and that's the crucial thing the biomarkers are useless until the animal or the person gets old they've got to have a certain amount of Aging behind them to see if they are young like in comparison to control untreated people or people with a different Gene you have to wait the

[01:02:42] Aging rate indicators because they are measures of speed you can look even when the animal is Young and hypothetically when a human is a young adult so most of the work um that we've done on the mutant mice was done on animals that were four to six months of age and the work on the drug treated mice was an animals were only 12 months of age there are changes that are in famous molecules molecules whose connection disease is not just fanciful one of these is ucp1 uncoupling protein one it's a mitochondrial protein that allows your mitochondria to burn fat without doing a lot of work it just turns the fat into heat it's involved in thermogenesis and it's long been known that having a lot of ucp1 um is something happens when you do exercise exercise increases ucp1 and mice that have a lot of ucp1 live a long time so it's thought to play a major role in protecting you from obesity from diabetes from metabolic syndrome from some sorts of inflammation well everyone of our slow aging mice has a lot of ucp1 in the white fat under the um skin and the white fat uh in the abdomen and also in the um the brown fat between uh the scapula all three of these fat Depot have elevated ucp1 the exception to that rule is very informative you remember two of those drugs kagin and 17 Alpha estradiol extend lifespan in males only and ucp1 goes up in males only for those two drugs which is a a strong indication that whatever process is making the drugs slow the uh uh mortality rate and increased longevity is the same process at least in its sex specificity as the ucp1 story and and tell me ucp1 you are measuring that how the fat and we look at the protein by Western block okay how much biologic noise do you think exists in that on a day-to-day basis in so so let's now talk about a normal Mouse a control mouse on the control diet if you sample his fat every day for a month and some days you put him on a treadmill uh wheel some days you don't some days he doesn't eat that much some days he does in other words he replicates for short bursts of time some of the activities that might either be associated with a longer life and or associated with a behavior that increases the protein of

[01:05:29] Interest it would be really Troublesome even if everything you said were true it would be really Troublesome if ucp1 spiked on those days because then it wouldn't really be a useful odometer or rather speedometer so you brought up three separate interesting issues and they need to be treated separately the first uh is in a normal Mouse where you're not making exercise and you're not not feeding them uh fagra uh if hypothetically you get a little bit of fat from that same Mouse every single day or every hour over the day would there be much change in ucp1 that experiment of course can't be done uh but it doesn't invalidate our findings because even if that would introduce Some Noise the consistent difference between the mutant mice or drug treated mice and the controls the noise is already built in uh budgeted into that if there was a lot of noise too much noise we wouldn't see a significant effect of the drug or the diet or the genetic intervention the second point you raise is could one perturb this by getting an animal to exercise and people have done that ucp1 is changed by chronic exercise um and that's one of the it's one of the reasons why it's thought to be amongst the mediators of the health benefits that tribute in people and in mice to to exercise the Third I was asking a slightly different question on that rich although that's good to know the question I was asking was if you took an otherwise SED Harry Mouse and exercised the hell out of him for a day and checked it then would you be fooled by an elevated level and you in other words could somebody cram for the test I don't know I I there may be some people out there who have done that uh but I'm not one of them and I don't know that literature very well it's it's an empirical question not not hard to address already have been done yeah and the related question is about time of day uh we try to normalize it that is our mice are always euthanized uh between 99 in the morning and 10: in the morning so we're not it's not the case that some of the mice are morning mice some of them are afternoon mice some of them are evening mice um and we feed them add lib so that does introduce some variation some may have had a early morning snack and some may have had their last meal 4 hours ago before uh the lights go on that also is going to introduce some noise into the into the measure how are the animals euthanized yeah we use a method that uh uh makes them go unconscious within 5

[01:08:08] Seconds that is we put them into a bag a plastic bag and then we fill the bag quickly with carbon dioxide gas they take a few breaths and within 5 Seconds they're unconscious and within 10 seconds they stop breathing okay so in other words it kind of minimizes to some extent the the hormonal stress at the end of life given that carbon dioxide is highly sedating that is exactly why we do it um the American Veterinary Medical

[01:08:39] Association has uh recently that is five years ago made the method we use a suspect method we still have permission to use it and we've we've talked to the vets about it so we're not violating any of the the rules but they recommend now I think this a rotten decision that mice be placed in a cage and that carbon dioxide gas be added gradually um it takes them seven we we

[01:09:04] Ed this on a batch of mice to see what it would take it takes seven minutes for them to stop breathing or to lose Consciousness and over that seven minutes um their um adrenaline level goes up as you can imagine their glucose doubles their blood becomes acidic right the pH drops so we would never want to do that because who knows what's that what is that doing to all the protein kyes and the metabolites anything that is glucose or hormone sensitive is gone going haywire there so we uh asked our Animal Care committee for that reason could we do it the way that it had been approved for the previous hundred years because doing it the new way would spoil all of our experiments they said yeah you're right which I think is both most more Humane and also better science yeah yeah I agree there's a there's an interesting parallel here with the way animals are harvested uh for human consumption which is unfortunate that the way most animals are harvested is very stressful on the animal and therefore that's right it actually erodes the quality of the the food that you're about to consume based on the stressful environment of the animal that's in the way at times yeah I can see that so are there any other candidates besides ucp1 that serve as a fantastic let me just list a few of them because a few of them are really interesting and exciting stuff um the same woman that did the ucp1 study her name is Jina Lee which is Li also looked at macrofagos in the fat they're two kinds one makes a lot of inflammation and all of these slow aging mice they go down and the other prevents inflammation the M2 cells all these mice that goes up so at least in the fat all of these influences genes diet and drugs make the fat much less inflammatory that's likely to be important because you are fully aware of all of those studies suggesting a lot of diseases involve inflammation High inflammation is a Sor sign of stress it's really bad for you so it may be that these drugs and diets and genes are working in part by reducing inflammatory tone now in addition we have looked at proteins in the brain the two we looked at in the brain one is called bdnf brain derived neurotrophic factor and it's thought to protect brain cells from stress the other is double Corton dcx which is a sign that the brain cells are making new brain cells it's a sign of neurogenesis these go up in the brain in all of the slow aging mice again the exception being the two drugs that are sexp specific and here the bdnf and double Cordon changes are also sex specific and seen in males only one quick question Rich sorry um the macroasia and M2 were in the fat cell was ucp1 also not in the fat cells in the macras is in the fat Depot okay where was the ucp1 was that in the liver or was that no we looked at in the brown fat in the ingano white fat which is subcutaneous and in the perigonadal white fat which is an abdominal three different fat

[01:12:20] Depot and the maccrage changes are seen in each of those Depot and the ucp1 which is in the adipocytes is also seen in all three of those Depot got it and I'm sorry I interrupted you you're about to say one more yeah the last one I was to sort of round we have many others now but the last one that's really I think thrilling is a protein called gpld1 um gpld1 it's made by the liver it's also made by the fat uh what it does is it there are lots of proteins that are sticking out outside on the outside of a cell and the linkage is a specific sugar Bridge uh glucose phos phosphoinositide that GPI Bridge gld1

[01:13:03] Cleaves that and so it releases lots of different kinds of proteins from cellular surfaces the reason we thought it was interesting was another lab Horowitz had shown this is just two or three years ago that if you exercise gpld1 goes up it's true for mice it's true for people and and more exciting even than that if you have gpld1 go up cognition goes up so Horowitz and his colleagues have argued that one of the reasons exercise is so good for your cognitive Powers is that it tricks the liver maybe the fat they said liver but we we found it from fat also into making gld1 which in an unknown way improves cognition so what we found now in our lab was that all nine kinds of slow aging mice 10 now um also have elevated gld1 production in the liver and amount of it in the plasma of the mice we can't prove that that's why bdnf goes up in the brain double

[01:14:09] Corton goes up in the brain some of these mice are known to have great cognition we can't prove that it's due to gld1 but obviously we we are hoping uh that that is the case the reason that the gld1 result was to me so extremely exciting was that in another part of the forest another part of the lab a guy named Gonzalo Garcia was looking on differential mRNA translation and he had discovered that slow aging mice it turns out all of them have a lot of cap independent translation that is they can pick a subset of the messenger rnas and translate them in a special way and cause proteins to be made in ways that are independent of the amount of RNA for that protein well we proved and published now that gld1 is one of those proteins it is controlled Not By changes in the transcription of the DNA into the

[01:15:01] RNA but by the differential translation of the RNA into protein in a cap independent translation uh module so this is our first serious link between the molecular biology of protein translation gonzala stuff and the physiological effects like cognition and uh bdnf which was uh uh Jenna's domain how it's really very pleasant to see these two different lines of experimentation sort of get tied together here uh through the same protein through the gld1 protein and tying this back to what we said earlier this is an example of where for example the epome might not matter as much because that presumably would have a greater impact on transcription and here you're saying actually this seems kind of independent of transcription this is a purely translational phenomenon yeah let me let me agree with that about 90% so the the 90% I agree with um many many Labs just look at RNA levels transcripton biology is relatively easy and now you can follow it up with epigenetic exploration of what controlled trans most of the published omix information is lists of rnas that go up or down however RNA is very poorly correlated with protein and it's the protein that counts a lovely pair of studies from the Jackson Labs Ron cango was involved in one of these they measured um a lot of this is Gary

[01:16:31] Churchill's work they took mice of four different age groups black six but what can you do and they uh measured the changes in proteins they made a long list of proteins that change with age good they did it in two tissues then they looked at the same mice a long list of rnas that changed with age in the same mice and the same tissues it turned turns out that the correlation between the RNA and the protein was 30% that is only 30% of the age effect on protein level could be blamed on attributed to changes in the underlying transcription data so if all you've got is the transcription data which is what most people have you have sort of blinded yourself to the 70 to other 70% of what is controlling protein levels and it's the proteins that actually do stuff uh in in the cell um I think uh until people come to grips with that discontinuity um they won't really be motivated to look at the proteins which are harder to study but doable and I think it is the proteomic data collection that will be valuable our lab has shown that the proteines can be modified we're not the first to show this both by differential RNA translation this cap independent translation and Joe Endicott has found that there's also differential degradation subsets of proteins that are degraded by the lomes through shapon mediat autophagy they mold the proteome in ways that are completely independent of the MRNA for the underlying proteins

[01:18:10] I think that's a big part of the story which people are just gradually waking up to yeah I think this is so important I'm going to just slow you down and I want to make sure we we go through this again in some detail I I understand what you're saying I want to make sure everybody does because I hadn't actually known that fact about the poor correlation between a protein translation and mRNA transcription that's a very big deal I would have guessed that to be a much higher number um me too so can can can you just go back and give everybody the sort of bio11 explanation for how we turn DNA into mRNA into TRNA and protein where that's occurring in this cell and you know so so people I want people to understand the point that you just made which I think I wrote down it's so vital um which is without the proteomic assessment the story is incomplete that that's to me the takeaway from what you just said not only incomplete but mostly wrong uh so yeah sure I mean um uh you learn nowadays I guess in in high school that um the the DNA can be transcribed into messenger r that has the same sequence more or less and encodes proteins that's where epigenetic control comes in they're the cells that are made only proteins made only by the liver are in large part because the liver has turned some transcripts on and others off the same as grp of the eye and the Brain Etc so now each cell has its own complement of RNA let's let's make sure people see that point again right the liver and the eye and the muscle have the same DNA why does the hepatocyte that the liver needs where whereas the neuron makes a protein that it needs this is where turning on and off the gene the epigenome matters okay so it certainly does matter people used to think it was the only thing that mattered and I think that's probably wrong but it's certainly an important thing many of the differences between the neurons and the skin cells and the blood cells and the liver cells are because they express different messenger rnas from the same DNA template it's just like if you have a library of of books and someone decides to uh read the trop and somebody else wants to read

[01:20:25] Emily Dickinson they they have different experiences even though they have the same Library uh to work with so now you've got a batch of rnas that you've transcribed selectively depending on the cell now you have to make them into proteins so the ribosome will generally bind to them and turn out protein and the sequence of the protein will be based upon the sequence of the bases in the messenger RNA most ribosomes start this by binding to the very end of the message at a place called the cap the five Prime cap that's not where the translation starts that's a sort of start here signal then the ribosome bumbles its way down to the place where it's going to start and then it starts making proteins so most translation is

[01:21:08] Cap dependent the ribosome can only find and get working on that messenger RNA by binding to the cap bumbling down to the start site and then making the protein so the default presumption which turns out to be wrong is that once you've got those rnas out there because of transcription into the MRNA the rest is automated they just churn out proteins based upon the RNA that they've got so there are now many studies and I quoted my favorite ones because they come from friends of mine and because it's related to aging there are now lots of studies that say the idea that the set of proteins depends only on what mRNA you've got got is really a poor approximation what Gary Churchill and

[01:21:58] Rod corena and their buddies uh accomplished was they actually looked at this in the context of Aging in a systematic way they looked at a tissue like kidney which is Ron's special favorite tissue they looked at kidneys of 6 12 18 24-month old mice and the made a long list of which genes change at the RNA level as a progressed and now they did the same thing but at the protein level same tissue same age same genetic stock the same mice as far as I know and so now they have two parallel lists and the old-fashioned default assumption would be that if you were on the winner list for a sensitivity for the MRNA you're going to be on the winner list for the proteins encoded by that messenger RNA and that was right 30% of the time not 100% but 30% there were big differences with age in the kidney and one other tissue I don't remember what other tissue they looked at there were big differences in proteins as aging went on but only 30% of those changes were uh corresponded to the same change uh same amount same direction in the messenger

[01:23:14] RNA the rest came in somewhere else so this could in and by the way is it post transational how much of that question and just going to get to that's what we don't know um there are a batch of possibilities I've pointed to differential translation this is the Garcia's work on cap independent translation where the ribosome doesn't care about the cap it can bind to something else on some of the mrnas and do those instead even if the cap is no longer working so that could be selective RNA trans translation now there's also selective RNA sequestration the RNA can be hidden and not made available there's selective RNA degradation this plays a role uh once the protein has been made it can be degraded chopped up into amino acids in many different ways the the prosome can do that and uh Jo endicot specialty there are lomes that can take in some but not all proteins a fairly small percentage of the proteins get degraded by the isome so there are changes in RNA stability changes in RNA location RNA translation protein degradation of many different flavors that will um in important ways modify the amount of the protein independent of any underlying changes in the messenger

[01:24:43] RNA I think more people learn about the non-transcriptional pathways that mold the proteome in in our case of course in the context of aging and anti-aging drugs but these same principles apply to any disease specific process any health process any drug response I'm just talking about it in in aging terms once people buckle down and sort of learn this they will not devote their entire labs to analysis of transcripts they'll pay more attention to proteins and also to the subtleties of what happens between transcription of the DNA to the

[01:25:24] RNA stage and then eventually the stable steady state level of the protein well I mean that's there's at least five I lost count right at least five uh plausible explanations and none of them are mutually exclusive so you could obviously have hybrids of these um absolutely as to all the places where you can quote unquote go wrong between transcription and the final protein output um this or go right I mean it you mold it whether it's bad for you or good for you is interesting um let's go back to the speedometer the Aging speedometer obviously one of the so so you used these 10 known cases of slower aging right so four genetic mutations that result in slower aging the tried andrue caloric restriction and then five drugs it's actually four four drugs published one is actually another mutant okay oh I see got it so four drugs um so you've got these 10 slowly aging phenotypes and now you've identified consistent very consistent even down to sex specific uh differences is there a dose effect that you're seeing because presumably these nine or 10 phenotypes technically have slightly different lifespans and therefore are slightly uh differentially aging yeah so let let me I I'll address that question in the context of a battery of things we don't know want to know and could find out in the next few years uh if we're given the opportunity um one of the things we would really like to know is what about the next three drugs do they do the same things to the same aging rate indicators that's a test of our hypothesis if the answer is yes yes and yes that is great if the answer is no no and no something has gone wrong and we need to reconsider the whole foundational idea another important area which is getting closer to what you were just asking is if you give a drug to a mouse how long does it take for the

[01:27:32] Aging rate indicators to switch if it takes a few months that is terrific because that means we can take a hundred drugs and test all 100 of them not for lifespan which is really expensive but test all hundred of them for the ability to switch aging rate indicators if we test a 100 drugs off the shelf or that some some colleague suggests to us and five of them switch all of the Aging rate indicators those are the five that are most likely we think to be winners for the lifespan experiment so we could use these as a a screen to try to identify drugs that are more likely than not to work in the context of a lifespan experiment we also don't know how long they stay switched so let's say we give a mouse rap a or 17 out Fester dial or mystery drugs ab and c and yes all the

[01:28:32] Aging rate indicators eight weeks later they're at the slow aging level okay now we remove the drugs will they stay the Aging rate indicators will they stay where they are we don't know that for drugs we do know it however because of a great experiment that we did with anj bartkey he was the inventor of the AMS dworf Mouse he's the first person who showed they were long lived anj had found that if you you take these as dwarf mice they're mice that have very low growth hormone very low igf1 and they live 40% longer he is found he published this 10 years ago if you give them growth hormone shots when they're a little baby just starting at two weeks of age and only for six weeks so we stopped giving them shots when they're 8 weeks old that's enough to turn off the whole anti aging program they are no longer long lived we found that they no longer have stress resistant cells and we found they no longer have low inflammation in the brain they go back to normal so what we did was we got from from anj bartkey some 20-month-old mice that were treated but only when they were babies so any epigenetic change that happened to them they'd have to do it in that growth hormone treatment period and remember it for 20 more months and the answer is that the changes in all the Aging rate indicators easily seen in the 20-month-old mutant mice they all went away in the mice that had gotten the growth hormone shots in the juvenile period so the exposure to growth hormone shots by injection for a brief period of time in youth was sufficient to lead to lifelong reversion of the

[01:30:19] Aging rate indicators to to the normal that is away from the slow aging position what we want to do now is the inverse of that we want to give them something good for them and see if we turn them on that is to slow aging and then it stays up forever that's what we're hoping to see of course we can also use these for people that's the sort of next Frontier if you give these drugs to people do the people change the Aging rate indicators if the answer there is yes that opens up of course course a massively productive

[01:30:55] Frontier for aging research in people one quick question about the am mice um what happens with the reverse experiment when you wait until they are you know 20 or call it even 12 months of age and give them growth hormone once they've fully matured do you shorten their life or revert their life back to normal no we we tried that my lab failed that is we started our shots at four weeks of age we did it in Snell dwarf mice which are more or less the same we started at four weeks and then 3 years later we had found that it had no effect whatever it took you know three years for the Bice to age it had no effect on life spin so bkey then did it starting at four weeks of age and he failed too that made me feel great we had just messed up I would have given up I had given up at that point bky did not give up he did it over again but this time starting at two weeks and when you start at two weeks it works when you start at four weeks at it doesn't okay going back to the biomarkers uh bdnf dcsf you're measuring dcx I'm sorry you're measuring those directly in sections of the brain you're measuring those in CSF where are you getting that we take uh bits and pieces of the hippocampus uh make a suspension of the proteins and do a western blot it's just measuring the amount of protein right in the brain okay as you think about the application of bringing this to humans what would what would it look like to bridge that Gap in other words if if if you wanted to know if this type of exercise routine versus that type of exercise routine this type of diet versus that type of diet or your home brew of Romy versus not is having a benefit at some level we will need to get this out of plasma it will be very difficult to do this out of CSF or even fat biopsies uh how difficult a bridge is that I'll tell you about uh two steps we're taking uh one of them is a collaboration with Steven Cummings and Teresa Mau and their colleagues they have a project at

[01:33:05] UCSF called Som s so they have a collection of several hundred human volunteers all in their 70s in good health these people took a lot of functional tests how good are they at thinking how fast are they how strong are they and then they allowed tiny tiny muscle biopsies and Tiny fat biopsies so we have requested and I think are likely to receive tiny bits of muscle and fat from these Brave volunteers and we will test do those that have a lot of the muscle specific change which is a protein called fndc5 and the fat specific change like ucp1 for instance our prediction is that amongst the 7-year-olds the really fit ones will be the ones that look as though they have always had uh youthful aging rate indicators so that will be one way in humans and we'll have plasma from these same people as well so that will be one way in humans of beginning to test internal tissues to compare with plasma but that's impractical for clinical use so what we really need now is ways of extending our results to plasma two of the things that we can measure uh we have measured and published in plasma it turns out that iin which is the product of G of uh fndc5 the thing that goes from muscle to fat that's in plasma and in fact it goes up in all of our slow aging mice and the other is gld1 which I was talking about previously gld1 is also in plasma and it also goes up in all of our slow aging mice so we'll be able to evaluate that in human plasma samples but we really want more than that so one of the studies that we will be doing in the next few years um with

[01:34:52] Katherine karowski and with a colleague named costus latas at Michigan he's a metabolomics expert we will take a batch of mice healthy young um3 mice the same kind that the ITP uses we'll take blood samples from them we will measure the Aging rate indicators in the blood but also in the muscle fat liver and brain of all these mice and costus will measure um several hundred metabolites in the blood of the same mice and our goal will be to ask which two or 10 or 20 or 100 metabolites correlate plasma metabolites correlate with the plasma and the internal tissue Aris if we can derive from this exploratory exercise a list of five or 10 things you can measure in

[01:35:44] Mouse and human plasma that tell you where the Aris would be internally that's great we think it can be done in principle there's a a terrific uh scholar younger scholar named Hamilton o working at Stanford with Tony Weiss coray Hamilton has been able to deconvolute plasma signals by saying these represent changes in the pancreas these represent changes in the liver these represent changes in the brain he's not working in in in mice yet I'm trying to twist his arm to get him to do it but in principle it it can be done you will be able we hope to detect plasma molecules which correlate with tissue specific levels of Aris that will be the bridge to human studies now is he doing that by looking at self-free

[01:36:34] DNA I can't tell you for two reasons a I don't understand it and B it was at a Gordon conference and I'm not allowed to talk about it but you could call Hilton his last name is spelled o or Tony Weiss K who runs the lab and maybe they'll tell you going back to um irisin or irisin that is the product from what protein well um it is a cleavage product of a muscle protein called fnd dc5 so we do two things we measure fndc5 as a protein in muscle and we measure iin as a peptide or protein in the plasma and they always in our hands go up and down together all the slow aging mice have more of the protein in the muscle and more of the ires in their blood there was um a study in nature God

[01:37:27] I I I want to say it was about 2011 maybe 2012 that made all this promise that um it was basically I think identifying that I Reon concentrations were high in people post exercise and the the the the the promise of the paper was we now have the exercise drug right it was we're going to we're going to just give people

[01:37:50] I and and that's you're giving them an exercise pill um the Temptation I suspect for any of these things is the same right presumably uh uh gpld1 in a pill is is something that someone's going to think hey that's got to be a good thing uh do you think that's a good thing and if not why not and by good thing I mean do you think it's going to have efficacy let's not let's take a moral judgment out of that and just talk about sort of clinical efficacy I recent has had a checkered past history the original papers that said what you just said turned out to be using an essay for IIs that was highly inaccurate in the sense that they overestimated the actual concentration of IIs by a factor of about a hundred not that's a problem okay and and people who were skeptical of the original results they actually worked out a mass spec based essay for

[01:38:48] Iris gold standard and proved that the original antibodies were not specific enough to be useful to actually measure irisin levels and so many people who had felt those original papers were highly promising as indeed they were sort of discounted the whole system but I now looks as though they were throwing out the proverbial baby with the bath water now there are good antibodies that are sensitive enough to detect Iris at actual levels when Jina Lee brought me her irisin data I said oh okay I sort of believe it but you know ir and antibodies have a terrible reputation let's look at the precursor protein FN dc5 in the muscle and uh we decided not to publish it until we had both the irin in plasma and the fndc5 by Western blot in muscle and they were they were paralleling one another so very well that I believed that I believe both of them now because they always came out same and why not just do the mass spec on the IR in that situation and avoid the we're no good at M spec and we know how to do Western blots okay um so back to the point do we think that these molecules are merely biomarkers of all of the Myriad good things that these behaviors drugs or exercises do I I will bet you I don't have any Secret inside dope I will bet you that that pharmaceutical companies thrilled with what OIC and its competitors are doing have devoted tons of money to f figuring out whether they can get something like

[01:40:22] Iris into you in a way that doesn't hurt you and does you some good you neither you nor I is the first person to have thought of this idea I'll bet the farm farm companies have devoted tons of money into looking at that I think is a highly promising area of research although I imagine a lot of it currently is proprietary gld1 is um a protein and swallowing a pill might not work because it might be digested in the stomach just like every every bit of meat you eat is digested the same is the same is true with ir as well it's also a peptide isn't it so these are going to need to be injectables presumably yes unless you can come up with a a more a small factor that turns on f& dc5 in your muscles that's what we want to get and you know we have we have those they're called anti-aging drugs right rapy does that a car that's sort of the part here that

[01:41:20] I'm really kind trying to wrap my head around philosoph philosophically is the wrong word but but metaphysically I suppose because on the one hand we have molecules that are now doing things that are impacting aging at a fundamental level again this is counterintuitive it's not counterintuitive to me that exercise or calorie restriction induce a longer life in the right model it's a little counterintuitive to me that rap ay does to be completely honest like I I don't dispute it for a moment because

[01:41:54] I've seen it now over and over and over again just as you have but it's still remarkable to me that a molecule is able to act at a fundamental level of Aging as opposed to way way way Downstream at the you know in the way that a lipid lowering drug Works where it works on one disease pretty much and it works through you know One path and the proof of that is indeed your aging accelerator that is in fact the proof of Jiro protection it almost becomes the sinanan of a molecule being geroprotective versus simply targeting a disease well let me let me phrase that in another way if you have a an a drug that extends M lifespan I think that's a critically important step towards making a case that it's slowing aging but it's not the last step I would not fully endorse that hypothesis unless someone has shown that the treated with that drug in addition to living a long time they also retain lots of youthful function their muscles are great their hearing is great their cognition is improved their bones are better we've made we've gone through all those steps with the Snell dwarf mice the as dwarf mice uh for the calorie restricted diet for the growth from receptor knockout mice um we're beginning to make that kind of a story for a carbos our first a carbos paper uh had grip rength and blood glucose control we're beginning to make that case for 17 alestra Dial as well and a carbos so by building those case Brick by Brick by Brick is really necessary to say it's not merely an anti-cancer drug that's right and something that was a broad spectrum anti-cancer drug I'll bet people are interested in that but it's not necessarily an anti-aging drug to make me happy it has to be an anti-aging drug and the evidence has to be effects on many different age sensitive properties but we have great evidence now for at least three mutants and the calor restriction diet and the methionine restriction diet and we're getting there for rapamycin and several of the other drugs that came along you know five years eight years after that so I think there will be a very strong case that these drugs are acting by slowing the aging process and delaying maybe not quite all but maybe all of the um aspects of Aging that make people unhappy about getting older and I agree with you it's a fundamental reorientation of instinct that's what this experimentation is designed to do it's designed to reset one's Instinct on these points we've already talked a lot about why the black six Mouse has a lot of problems you've also alluded to the fact that they're basically genetically programmed to die of cancer what is the uh natural history of your mice and how does the uh natural death of the mice in the control group by cause we've already obviously talked about length of Life uh but what is the cause of death in the controls typically versus the treated in the success cases yeah two two very good questions um the context that's necessary here is that nearly all of the mice that are available throughout the world for medical experimentation um come from the Jackson laboratory which for 30 or 40 years was mostly interested in cancer so when ever mouse got cancer they kept it so most of the strains that became the world positively selected for cancer they were selected for getting a lot of cancer so the um had three mice four different grandparents and cancer is the cause of death in about 80% of our mice but it's varied uh some sort of lymphoid or leukemia cancer maybe 30 or 35% of the deaths uh in the males pulmonary cancer liver cancer uh are both prominent in the female it's uh um not pulmonary so much but breast cancer liver cancer again humio saroma and then maybe 30% of the mice if both sexes die of you know 1% will die of this kind of cancer 2% will die of this kind of cancer 3% of that kind of cancer so it's 80% of the time it's some sort of neoplasia that is the the lethal uh injury um and that's why one could make initially a case all these drugs are doing is slowing down every single kind of cancer it's why we have to look at a lot of things that are not cancer the second part of your question is does the proportion of different kinds of cancers or causes of death change in these different mice and that's a hard question to answer because when we do a necropsy series at the endend of life which is you have to do it the end of life to see what they died of then we usually have only about 60 mice in the treated group and about 60 mice in the control group so if if a particular kind of of cancer let's say liver cancer kills 10% of the mice you only have six cases and yeah if that goes up to nine or goes down to three that would answer your question with a yes but statistically we just don't have enough cases to be confident only once did we come across a statistically significant alteration and could have been a fluke we had a drug that was extending lifespan in males and females but it did not increase the age at death of the females ding of breast cancer so one could have made a case that breast cancer is caused by something that is not related to this drugs anti-aging mode that's something we're always on the lookout for but the number of autopsy cases is almost always too small to really have a good grip on it well that's why I think it makes it very interesting that we're going to see your colleague coming on board who specializes in the neuroscience and the

[01:47:52] Neurology of the mice because I think to make this truly exciting we want to continue to see functional improvements and functional improvements in both strength uh and cognition would go a long way and by the way it also is worth I guess asking I haven't asked you this but do you know if there are cases of drugs that do not improve lifespan but do improve say grip strength and treadmill time um in other words are there are there drugs that are improving

[01:48:26] Health span without lifespan in the ITP that you've documented yeah this is this is a chestnut that always comes up and the Aging Institute in particular is passionately interested in the notion maybe a drug will make you healthy and then you'll drop dead right on schedule um I I myself the answer your questions no one has looked forward and that's because in our phase one assays yes too much work you can't do it we we don't do it we only do those detailed studies on things that extended lifespan the reason that things extend lifespan is basically it postpones all the bad stuff that that lead to death so to do it the we could screen a lot of drugs for age sensitive variables and the hopes that we would find one that made age sensitive variables go away but didn't have any effect on lifespan I'm not so sure that we would find any the you know it's trivially easy to do that um if you teach a mouse to do push-ups you will postpone age Associated changes in muscle mass and muscle strength and if you tra teach them they won't get food until they solve a maze they're going to get pretty D good at solving that maze so system specific postponement of uh age sensitive outcomes is not too hard to achieve it's not really relevant I think to the issue of what you can do to postpone all the aspects of Aging together let's pivot and talk about um one of the successes of the ITP that still somewhat perplexes me you've already alluded to it several times which is 17 Alpha estradiol so um

[01:50:05] I I'm pretty sure I asked you this question last time but I will ask you again remind me the difference between 17 Alpha estradi and 17 beta estrad which is the estradi that is the dominant form in both males and females like rolling around with lots of 17 beta traditionally called estrogen yeah so the 17 Alpha estradi is just the same chemically as the 17 beta except for one of the bonds instead of pointing up out of the plane points down in the opposite direction so it's a stereoisomer same chemical formula all the atoms are attached in the same place it's just that two of them are pointing up instead of pointing down and because of that manipulation it doesn't bind very well to the traditional as famous estrogen receptors so it's doing something it's got to be binding to something but it it probably is not the traditional estrogen receptors or it might be that plus something else to get um an effect on estrogen sensitive tissues you can do it with 17 alest you just have to use a lot more I think tenfold more is what Jim

[01:51:12] Nelson found when when he did that titration and what was the rationale when this was proposed to the ITP what was the scientific rationale for why would be a a recommended it he's a steroid physiologist neuroendocrinologist he reasoned and a lot of this was wrong but this is the rationale estrogens are good for you that's why females live longer than males let's find an estrogen we can give to males we don't want to give them 17 bait estradi because they'll turn into girls and they won't like that no one wants to be a girl so let's use 17 Alpha estradiol because they won't turn into girls it does not turn on secondary sexual characteristics maybe it will do all the good stuff that estrogen 17 beta actually does that was Jim's argument very plausible now it turns out that if you give 17 alrol to male mice it pushes their lifespan Way Beyond females it's not merely mimicking the good stuff if if there is good stuff that estrogen 17 beta does in females if so it wouldn't go fur than seven females are and it goes well beyond significantly Beyond normal females or drug treated females because the drug doesn't affect female longevity at all what it binds to in which cells in which tissues what it's turning on biochemically is at this point quite obscure there at least two

[01:52:40] Labs that I know of Mike Stouts I think Mike is now in Oklahoma and um my former student Mariana sersi Mariana is at Wayne State they've published some really nice papers getting at the issue of what a 17 Alpha estral actually doing physiologically what does it bind to Mariana her last three papers and her just awarded Grant are focused on what 7

[01:53:05] Al estral does in the brain what it does to estrogen sensitive and estrogen insensitive parts of the brain so there are a small number of labs I wish there were more that are diving into that question what is the target what is the receptor what is the physic ological effect and the more people that work on that I think the happier we will be and again there's no 17 Alpha estradi is as potent in males as

[01:53:33] Ramy I'd have to double check I think it's about a 19% increase don't quote me on this I need to look it up uh okay yeah we'll have it in the show notes but in N something around there in in the optimal dose in males uh and the original dose of rapamycin is there or slightly below that we now have a better result with rapamycin when we combine it with a carbos we can kick the male lifespan up to 29% increase unbelievable that's our that's our winner uh it's the first time simply unbelievable it's the largest percent increase we've ever gotten and also it's the first time we've gotten an increase by combining two drugs together uh so that that's the best we've been able to do and we so far we can't get 17

[01:54:18] Alpha estral to 29% but I think we can get it up to 19% have you combined 17 Alpha restor with Raa yet what a good idea we're testing that now yeah are you okay I mean several several other groups are testing it also it because it is a good idea I'm not making fun of you um it is such a good idea that we're trying it and I know of at least one startup company that's trying that as well I mean again there's something about this

[01:54:43] Alpha 17 Alpha estral story that is so fascinating to me one there's the total lack lack of clarity around the mechanism of action and then there's this sex difference which can't be attributed to any mimicking of 17 beta estradiol given the two facts you mentioned that the males LeapFrog the females and the females acrew no benefit um you know I I I'm yeah I guess I'm a little bit disappointed to hear there you know

[01:55:12] I guess only Marana and Mike working on this problem there may be others I mean those are just friends of mine that I know of there may be others as well I don't know the literature well enough to tell you okay I can I can give you an insight into what we thought was going on with the 17 alestra and how badly Rog we were um Mike Garrett whom I've mentioned earlier he uh collaborated with a guy named Mo Jane to look at among other things steroids in the tissues of mice treated with 17 alestra

[01:55:42] Dial and he noticed something really interesting he found two steroids they were members of the estriol family not estro die all but est3 all that were elevated at least 20 fold in males that got the drug and they were not elevated in females at all it was a male specific production of estriol when 17 Alpha estradiol was given to the males and we knew it was sex specific because if he castrated the males before the drug you didn't see the estriol production the conversion from estradiol to estriol dependent upon testosterone or some other testicular hormone so we said okay great we've got a winner estriol that's going to be the one that is going to work in both males and females that's the active ingredient and the data set that's 90% complete and we'll probably start writing it up in uh uh a month or two when we're when we have 90% of the mice dead but we have 50% of the mice dead so

[01:56:45] I'm we've presented at meetings and I'm allowed to talk about it says that that guess was was partially right and partially wrong the hydroxy version of estriol is great for males it's actually at least as good as 17 alestra Dial we won't know till we have the last few deaths but it's terrific that was a good guess you don't need 17 Al estra diol because the estriol works terrific however we thought it would work in females and it is the first drug we found that diminishes lives sped females so the idea that it would work to benefit females was wrong it is for mysterious reasons harmful in females so we really don't know yet why and to be clear this is just straight estriol H 16 hydroxy estriol okay why did you pick 16 hydroxy as opposed to four hydroxy 2 hydroxy or just pure estriol was that because that's the only one that went up with the administration of self 17 Alpha estrad in the males this is a very good question and you've stumped me I don't know the answer Mike Garrett who told us which estriol to buy does know the answer and okay uh we could ask him but I don't know what uh prompted Mike maybe it was commercial availability maybe it was Prior studies of toxicity in mice Mike has his reasons and I read the application three years ago and I don't remember what specifically led him to suggest this compound it wasn't you know just stab at the sigma catalog what did the the female mice that are dying at an accelerated rate anything specific about this the the manner of death okay we don't know yet we haven't done any net crops yet okay we'll have to do that what is the let's talk about a couple notable failures in the ITP I.E drugs that everybody thought were home runs that didn't pan out I guess the three that come to my mind are RIS veratrol metformin nicotinamide riboside uh any other should be on that list most people who suggest drug think their drug is going to work but I think the three you've pointed out are the ones that have gotten the largest numbers of notices in AARP bulletins and on social media and at uh the conventions where people uh want to mingle with snake oil salesman so um they are certainly the most the most famous and I think there's a different level of enthusiasm for each one of them met foran I think has been very sensitively proposed as a potential anti-aging drug in people I I don't know enough about its benefits and side effects I know that you yourself have you know 10 times more information about this than I do but a case has been made because it's so very safe uh in people that it could be used in people to postpone aspects of Aging I can see reasons not to believe that but at least you can make a case for that it doesn't seem to work in mice um the ITP showed that it didn't work in mice and now several other groups have confirmed that result Rafa diabo at one point claimed that it worked in mice but he used a very weird statistical test and I suspect that if you had if he had used the standard statistical test it would have failed in his lab as well I haven't seen the data so I'm not sure of that but that's my guess Resveratrol was was hyped um for uh many years people often with commercial interests or who had a grant or who wanted to get a lot of money for clinical trial would start their talk with a beautiful bottle of red wine and then say R veratrol is in red wine and cerin are uh uh important and

[02:00:35] Resveratrol influences cerin and just take some of my Resveratrol or cerin activating agent and you'll live forever none of that was right I mean it's been shown very clearly now that the amount of Resveratrol and red wine is to get enough of it you need to uh drink 30 bottles a day it status as a cin activator has been questioned by very serious and skilled biochemists the original data on worms has been disconfirmed by a couple of very good

[02:01:06] Labs uh so it was mostly hype people made a lot of money by selling companies that had an interest in certu and activators we tested it um because um the director of the national aging Institute Richard hotus for the first and last time said you will test Resveratrol or you will not get anybody this year we said yes sir yes sir so we we tested it we used we checked with

[02:01:31] David Sinclair and asked David what is the concentration we ought to use he said use this concentration and this concentration we said sure we'll do it your way let's find out and it didn't work and subsequently many groups now including groups that Dr Sinclair is associated with have shown that it doesn't work to extend lifespan of regular mice the famous paper was one in which the mice were Poisoned With a 60% coconut oil diet and they weren't dying of Aging they were dying because their liver swelled up to the point that it crushed their lungs and they couldn't inhale uh they couldn't breathe this is not I believe a pretty good model for the Aging response so I think the evidence that Resveratrol by itself should have been tested was quite weak and the fact the evidence that it works is U very bad it it almost certainly doesn't do anything at least in mice in terms of Aging an anec does it surprise you how ubiquitous RIS veratrol supplements are still on the internet I mean go to Amazon sorry to be cynical people are very easy to fool it's easy to come up with eight or 10 things that people believe because they read them on the Internet or they watch them on Fox news or whatever and they're just strong about this but they're very people are very very gullible the the anecdote about resat trol that I think is um gives you a sense of what that time was like I had a friend a neurologist at Michigan who had been given a huge Grant to give

[02:02:59] Resveratrol to Alzheimer's patients or P at the early stage to see if it would slow Alzheimer's tons of money and he came around to a meeting of R veratrol biologists I was attending it and he asked people what dose to use and the range of suggested doses as milligrams of drug per person per day uh ranged over a million fold that is among the the experts the world's experts on

[02:03:30] Resveratrol the consensus ranged from one to a million as to what dose was the most logical one so this is a sign of a field that is making it up as it goes along NR is the last of the three drugs that you mentioned yeah I had High Hopes so probably more hype with NR than RIS truthfully on some level somebody's making a lot of money yeah many people are um so tell us about uh tell us about the the findings and what it tells us or doesn't tell us we tested it and it didn't didn't work um that is it didn't extend Mouse lifespan some people said oh well you have to use nmn a metabolite that would have a more bioavailability and better profiles and this is reasonable and um if someone makes a good case that we should test nmn and we could afford it the commercial sources are expensive um we would probably test that as well I think the notion that I I would have to imagine that some commercial party would donate the the the drug at this point right we are in negotiations with one such company yes I'm hoping you're right

[02:04:38] I hope we could we could accomplish that um so I'm I'm I'm not a non-believer uh I am a non-believer Who for NM and the whole nicotinamide modulating family I think the book is still open and there's a reasonable chance that some really good stuff could come out of that it might be that you'd have to give an enzyme that modifi the metabol an inhibitor of one of the metabolizing enzymes or a a different form um I have a colleague who has suggested um I don't know if this is public yet but there's someone who suggested that NR may work in combination with another drug and his ideas are good ones and they've been accepted by the ITP we're going to try the NR plus something else that this colleague has recommended to us so although NR by itself did not extend

[02:05:35] Mouse lifespan uh it could be that some other trick will uh lead to physiologically important modulation of NAD availability in some cell of Interest it could be the what counts is changing the availability in a Cell in the hypothalamus or in the pancreatic beta cell or in the lymph nodes or something finding a dose that is appropriately good for the cells that count but doesn't produce side effects in other cells may be tricky but it might work I'm I'd love to test it other things in that General nature and of course I mean it goes without saying I I should have said this earlier the fact that something fails mice doesn't mean it's going to fail in people testing it in people is going to be much harder it's easier to sell stuff that's untested but in principle one could actually test it in people and see if it does anything good I I'd love to see someone do that well that's why I I think with those three failures if I'm going to sort of summarize your point of view yeah I think the failure of RIS veratrol in the ITP I think you view as dispositive that that drug never worked in any circum irance anywhere it doesn't work in humans it doesn't work in mice and you just demonstrated that more well our evidence is not dispositive that is it could be true that it doesn't work in mice but it works great in people or it could be it would work in mice at a 20 times well I mean yeah but I think I think your your point is the plausibility for that is very low given that it fa building the case that verro has been overhyped if you look in deta at the evidence suggesting it has health benefits most of those studies are unconvincing and many of the ones that are convincing were submitted by people who are trying to sell something and and by the way even putting that aside it's the only study that's really convincing is the one you described with the you know the force feeding of coconut oil um so so that's sort of problematic what I hear you saying with NR and met foran is even if we repeat these studies over and over again in itps which you won't directly but you will potentially in other combinations um you have more faith in the possibility that those could still be viable in humans yeah I'm I mean the theoretical case that metformin might be good for you that's plausible it's not completely proven but it sensible and the same is true for things that are attempting to rescue age Associated changes in NAD the the I'm no expert in either of those fields but the little bit I know is consistent with what it's these sponsors are saying there's a good plausible case we get as I said you know in a good year 20 or 25 applications for eight or 10 of them there's a good plausible case to be made that this drug deserves testing and most of those good plausible cases yield negative results and that's expected that's one of the nice things about aging rate indicators if it if they work if they are flipped by drugs in a short period of time then um we hope our hit rate will right now it's about 10% give us big effects and a total of 15% give us significant effects if we can get that up to 50% by pre-screening with aging rate indicators so that half of the drugs we throw into lifespan studies actually give a lifespan benefit that would be that would be nice so rich I don't know if you know this about me but oh I don't know 15 to years ago I used to spend an awful lot of time on boats now these these weren't big boats these are typically small boats so these are kind of 30 foot boats where you're out in really really really rough water um yeah so hours in hours I don't know how many hours of my life

[02:09:36] I've spent out in you know 30 40 miles off the coast of California uh getting thrown around like crazy and um I was pretty lucky I'm I've only been seasick once in my life which when you consider the amount of time I've spent out there I I consider pretty pretty fortunate but but most of the people I uh I I I spent time with out there got seasick a lot more and um one of the drugs that people used to take care of their seasickness was an over-the-counter uh drug called

[02:10:13] Meine so um I would occasionally take it I didn't take it that often cuz again I I almost never got seasick but sometimes just to be safe I would say you know what the water looks unbelievably rough today uh I'm going to take my my mezine over the counter uh bony I think is the brand name B NN b n i n e bon bon yeah so um why am I telling you this story

[02:10:39] Rick I'm sure the listener is wondering why is Peter bringing I have a I have an answer for you I'm spending two weeks in December in a small boat actually off the coast of C we're going to go up and down the archipelago uh doing photography and the Seas there can be very choppy and we've been told to take um Meine uh or some other anti- seasickness remedy so that we'll be able to photograph to our hearts content without feeling ill and Meine is also included in the latest paper for the ITP which which also makes it of Interest the the paper that we've just submitted it hasn't been accepted yet but uh again because is complete I'm allowed to to present it at meetings and in talks like this there are two drugs one is Meine one is estane which in males led to a significant increase about 10% in the lifespan of the males um Meine was suggested to us by Gino copasi um he knew that Rapa was good as an anti-aging drug and it was a tour inhibitor so he took um several thousand

[02:11:50] FDA approved drugs and in a tissue culture asset he said which of these inhibit tour maybe a safe drug that inhibits tour could find a place as an anti-aging remedy and at the top of his list to everyone's surprise certainly his was megazine it was famous as an anti-histamine and also has mysterious CNS effects which is why it's so good for seasickness it wasn't I believe known as a tour inhibitor but found that it was and so he suggested that we test it and uh it does indeed lead to at the dose we used a significant increase about 10% in a lifespan of the male mice it did not affect females so we're going to try it again at higher concentrations and see if we can get that to go we haven't proven that the effect is mediated by tour inhibition it has a lot of CNS effects and maybe the good stuff that it's doing to the male mice is unrelated to tour maybe it has to do with changes in um serotonin or histamine production in some critical nucleus in in the brain we need to now look at that but that that's the the cool news the other thing that same paper has um there two points of interest one is aanin asanin is also available over the counter you can buy it in your your local drugstore it is alleged to have health benefits but they're all over the map and I can't assess strength of the evidence for health benefits it's also alleged to have many different physiological effects like an anti-histamine or uh uh an anti-inflammatory or an antioxidant it's been alleged to do a little bit of everything but there's a company in food

[02:13:34] Dy isn't it uh yeah it's fam we eat it all the time it's famous because it's what's turned salmon pink the reason if you want to make your far farm grown salmon pink you dump tons I mean tons you know dump truck loads of AA into the water and the salmon turned pink it's not that you dip the salmon into as theanine the natural salmon eat a lot of crustaceans which have this stuff in their shells and you can mimic that effect in farm grown uh salmon by giving them synthetic or naturally derived ASD anine in any case there's a company Hawaii that believes it might have health benefits and they asked us to test it and we did test it and that also has a significant effect and also it's males only so this paper hopefully will be accepted soon and out for people to judge the strengths of the evidence neither of these led to a change in our measurement of Maximum lifespan this test of percentage of live mice at the 90th percentile it's possible that at a higher or maybe even a lower dose it might have done that we're going to need to go back and do a more complete dose response curves the the reason this paper is I think likely to be of particular interest to the general public uh is that it is the first time we've gotten winners that you can buy without a prescription over the counter they're not as strong in terms of lifespan benefit as the four drugs we were talking about earlier on in our discussion but um uh and of course we don't know if they will work in humans at all but um the uh position of the FDA that you can't test a drug claiming it has an anti-aging effect will be of less relevance if some of the uh over-the-counter non-prescription medicines actually slow aging first in mice and then maybe also eventually in people um I think that's an interesting political and legal question in terms of the science we now need to figure out what is ananth doing and is Meine acting through tour or through some other

[02:15:43] Target it opens up as as any new drug does it opens up um new possibilities for mechanistic exploration you can bet we're going to be looking at the AG grade indicators at tissues from Meine treated and aanin treated mice well you know the last thing in the paper so the last thing in the paper that many people will be interested to know is we've tested ftin um this was suggested to us by poor

[02:16:11] Robbins and Jim Kirkland and tamaron and their colleagues um if I see is undergoing a lot of human trials because of claims that it is a senolytic drug there are some people though I not in that group who think that there's such a thing as a sence cell and that you get a lot of them when you get old and that they're bad for you and that a drug that removes sin essent cells therefore will be good for you I'm not convinced but this is a very popular line of thought so fan was given to us as a drug to test the hypothesis that if you remove ccent cells from mice by giving them fistin they would live longer a very I thought it wouldn't work but it was a very reasonable and important thing to do so we gave fetin uh two different dose regimes suggested by Dr Kirkland he had found in his lab with his kind of mice that they did work at this dose so that was good news we thought we were trying to replicate his stuff in our mice at much larger scale and the take messages were two first it had no effect whatsoever on lifespan of male or female mice using either of the dosage regimes that that uh Dr Kirkland recommended however that is not dispositive because it turns out it didn't remove any ccent cells either um what we can do is you can there are quite a number of surface markers like p16 that the sessen cell gurus say this will tell you whether you've got sin essent cells they do go up with age they go up with age and we looked at three different tissues ises that is um Paul

[02:17:49] Robins lab and Jim Kirkland's lab we we sent them tissue it was blind so they wouldn't know which ones were controls and which ones were treated they sent us back this number of beta galac aidas positive cells this number of P6 positive cells this number this amount of p21 and when we unblinded it there was no effect of fistin on brain on liver on muscle on kidney um at either lab for any marker that we looked at so we thought we were testing the notion that removing siness and cells would be good for you and it turned out we were testing the notion that feden removes sesd cells now maybe it works in people this is not my area but uh we our colleagues were disappointed and I can understand why they were disappointed in this in both results Rich say more about your lack of belief around the role of senescent cells I you you made it sound like you don't believe in ccent cells I assume what you meant was that actually what you meant or did you mean you don't believe that ccent cells Drive aging or that you don't believe removal of sessen cells slows or reverses an aging phenotype let say say a bit more on that whole thing I'm in a slightly awkward position because to tell you the details of why all that is true and the details require you know just don't say you'll have to kill me if you tell me that's the only thing I don't want to hear no no no no I don't do that um it's it's a long long story but let me give you an analogy if if someone says do you believe in stress the answer is sure I believe in stress right but that doesn't end the conversation because there's the stress of being about to undergo a tense podcast discussion or the tension of having to give a talk be the national aging institutes committee or the stress of dental work I hate dental work or the chronic stress of being locked into a marriage or a job that you really hate or getting a diagnosis of Cancer all of the or dropping a bit of of poison into your GI tract all of those produce stress but they're radically different things they produce different physiological effects and to say Do You

[02:20:08] Believe In stress or is this caused by stress is a way of blinding yourself accidentally to the critically important distinctions so do I believe that there is such a thing as a ccent cell yeah if you take cells in human cells in culture they stop dividing and those have been called ccent cells they exist no question about it and they're caused by

[02:20:29] TI shortening now if you take another kind of cell and you zap it with x-rays you get a different kind of cell they make different proteins they don't have TMR problems people have referred to those as ccent cells if you have cells when you get older they have p16 on them people have referred to those as ccent cells and by saying that this drug removes senescent cells they are hoping you won't begin to think about what the vague definition of what a syence cell is in laboratory a these proteins are called the sence secreted proteins in lab B it's two of those plus seven more in lab C well they don't see those but they do see changes in the nucleis which they view as ccent so I believe that there certainly are cells that accumulate in mice and in people when you get old that do stuff that's bad for you some of them might make this set of cyto kindes some of them maybe they can't divide anymore and that's bad for you some of them may even have uh two of these problems together maybe some of that has changed because

[02:21:43] Ras has been mutated or DNA has been damaged or something and exploring what causes those things how they become bad for you whether moving that cell type is good I think that's wonderful now if you say ah these are ccent cells I've got a drug that removes ccent cells you are skipping all the interesting stuff that's my view got it so it's as it's as much a lack of nuance and a um semantics issue as it is potentially or even more so than a biology problem and when people talk about analytics uh you're saying hey we can't really talk about cytic without understanding which sessen cell you're targeting or which secretory product of sessen cells you're targeting that's a that's a part of it although the problem is much deeper than that let me let me tell you a story there's this famous paper Judy cesy was the key author yes she measured the number of senescent cells this is the paper that introduced beta galacti sitas as the way to count sessen cells and she looked at the skin of a lot of people young and old people and she counted the number of sessen cells and proved that it went up a lot with age that was a very influential paper if you look at the paper she's at the she's at the buck Institute correct if I'm not mistaken Dr cesy yeah Judy is

[02:23:06] I believe at the buck Institute yeah yeah um so in this original paper which is many years ago the scores were 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus and four plus not actually a percentage of cells that were betag gal positive in the skin sections and only one person was four positive there was a 90 some yearold grandmother well the the actual cell counting was done by a Friend of Mine Monica peacock who is a dermatopathologist we were all at bu at that time so I called Monica and I said okay Monica so four plus how many cells do you have to get to be four plus and she said yeah that's 10 the minus 4th that is the the the skin section that had the highest number of betaal positive cells had only one positive cell or 10,000 yeah one in 10 to the fourth cells everybody else all the 70s 60s 50s all of those people had um fewer than one cell in 10,000 so the statement is literally true sessen cells go up with age these people wouldn't make up the data but they didn't emphasize the fact that even in the very oldest sections the oldest people the number of actual sessen cells was was really quite small by the way what was the difference between the 10 to the 3s 10 to the or sorry the 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus because it clearly those aren't those numbers don't refer to log differences so what I don't know that would be worth knowing right I mean because if it goes from if it goes from one and 100,000 to one if if there's a 10 if there's a log full jump between every group You could argue maybe there's something interesting but then at that point it's pretty hard to count that was the high limit I mean all the take message here is that ccent cells at least as indicated by that one marker beta galacti cdas are so rare that they're virtually absent from the skin of people of any age that is virtually absent I would consider 10 the minus 4th and and lower um but it's been a very influential I believe overly emphasized over influential concept so I was hoping we would show that ftin would remove ccent cells from mice and it would had no lifespan effect that was what I was betting on but uh in fact that didn't seem to actually remove p16 or p21 positive cells from any of the tissues that we evaluated so we're we're back at square one so we're still back what we have learned is that fettin doesn't do Jack what we haven't learned is if removing senescent cells is or is not beneficial yeah and by working people you know Jim

[02:25:50] Jim Kirkland believes and he could be right that you can get it to work even in mice if you administered as a Bolis dose a huge dose once a day rather than gradually in the food that's that's reasonable he might be right about that there's another very popular anti- um ccent drug out there God it's a it's a chemotherapy actually um begins with a d anything ring in a Bell I I'm blanking on the name of it yeah there's a combination people often give cortin plus the that's the right yep yep has that been proposed yet as part of the

[02:26:26] ITP yes and I can't discuss it because we're not allowed to discuss anything that comes in except the things we accept it was not accepted so it sounds like we have a lot to catch up on in a few years we're going to need to do a rundown on the repeat studies of 177 Alpha estrad plus uh Romy we're going to need to understand the tier 2 studies of uh

[02:26:55] Meine and um uh uh the estan correct um and we're going to also have to see how they validated against the Aging indicators as well presumably we'll also have a little bit more insight into the crossbridge or the link between the Aging indic s and plasma biomarkers that may start to bridge that Gap towards um actually assessing interventions in in humans so I guess there's no shortage of stuff we'll we'll have to catch up on

[02:27:29] Rich yeah I I I I like that whole list and I would add one point to it that we touched upon a little earlier I'd love to know whether these drugs slow cognitive failure of course yep that's right I think the the the addition of your colleague now coming on board for all tier 2 studies to to have a cognitive component I think is incredibly exciting again I think this point about really understanding Health span fully uh can't be overstated some might argue even more important in lifespan one of the nice things about this program is that it's designed merely to stim not merely but one of the things is designed to do is to stimulate work in other labs there are a lot of labs that are really good at cognition or heart failure or bone failure we send these people tissues all the time papers have begun to appear showing that the drug does this or it fails to do this or whatever so the hope is that for every paper we publish with a new drug that works this will trigger working a couple dozen Labs using that drug either with our tissues or with their own tissues and that some of those will come up with disease specific indications disease specific functional benefits uh the ITP can't do everything by itself but we're really hoping that um public publicization of our um results will trigger others into uh doing good work one of the reasons I was so pleased to be invited to back to speak with you was that the last time I was invited to speak with you was the most productive uh interaction I had had not just in the sense of how enjoyable it was to chat with you but also for several weeks after that I got a lot of people writing to me saying hey here's a good idea and often it was a good idea or let's collaborate on this or can you send me this tissue or uh you know it was a this particular podcast is listened to by a lot of smart people who uh uh pay attention to what is going on and that's a major resource so I'm glad that you're invited me thank you well I

[02:29:31] I would I would Echo that rich I I mean we certainly don't have the largest audience on the planet but I would argue we have the most intelligent um and the most curious and um also those who participate a lot that's the other reason I asked the question about under other mechanisms for funding um again I think it's a it's a it's a it's a remarkably poultry sum that is spent on this when you consider the utility that can come of this especially with some of the other um I don't want to use the word ancillary because that's almost disparaging in the sense but these other sort of ACC creative tools that are being bundled onto it such as the neurocognitive assessment uh and the and the Aging biomarkers but I really see this as a very important program that even when you include the indirect cost is a $4.5 million program per year um there are lots of philanthropists out there who would happily put their dollars to work if they could double the throughput of these molecules and the biomarkers and the insights so I know that there are going to be people listening to this um who who are probably going to say look I I'm kind of interested in doubling down on some of that funding uh it's probably more it's a higher Roi than giving a couple million dollars to a university to put an endowed chair in place um uh and and so um anyway I think I think a lot of good and I'm hopeful a lot of good comes in this good well Rich that would be nice thank you again uh always enjoyable to speak and um enjoy your uh your your trip tomorrow and not to mention your trip but to Chile uh later on I'll send you a picture I know you will I can't wait from the boat thanks byebye thank you bye [Music]
