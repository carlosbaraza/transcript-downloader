## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:41] this podcast episode I'm speaking with my friend dr. Bret countless brett is a New York city-based eye and facial plastic surgeon who specializes in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery of the face but particularly specializing around things to do with everything with the eyes including the skin around the eyes he's trained both in general oculoplastic surgery and general cosmetic surgery I met Brett about three years ago and I still remember our first meeting we met for the first time when he just came by my office at some point and we sat around having coffee and as he walked me through not just his training but which is actually quite unique but also his particular approach

[00:01:26] I realized we were kind of kindred spirits in our appreciation for nuance as you'll learn in this episode I know pretty much nothing about looking good and skin and eyes and all that stuff and in many ways to spend time with Brett is to spend time with someone who thinks a lot about how to make small and subtle changes over time that lead to long lasting effects and I think the reason that resonated so much with me is my belief in longevity of course is that it's a compounding issue and therefore making small but consistent changes that lead to seemingly small improvements over the short run is actually what leads to amazing results over the long run with respect to the reduction of risk of disease etc Brett's approach to cosmesis is the same way and I suspect that my bias is probably what has me thinking that that's really the right way to do it and once I got to know Brett better and we started to collaborate and work together and I've sent a number of patients to Brett I was always amazed by the responses because to me the right way to for example do Botox is to be able to look at a patient after the procedure and say I didn't know you had

[00:02:41] Botox and so things that we talk about here are a bunch of things that you can do to make a huge impact on the health and vitality of your skin and he does get into a number of these things specifically around Botox he also gets into a growing list of sort of all the facial treatments and cosmetic procedures that are out there lasers peels all of these sorts of things and most importantly I think he also helps you as the listener think about how to pick someone because again you know many of you listening to this might find this stuff interesting and sure if you happen to be in New York and you want to meet Brett that's great but most likely you're not and so the more important question is how do you sort of separate the good from the great or even the great from the not-so-great in this space so again like I said I don't think a lot about this personally

[00:03:27] I realize I should probably think about it more when I look at pictures of myself today versus pictures of myself when I was 30 I am sort of surprised at how much I feel like I look like I've aged and I guess part of this was a bit of a wake-up call for me that I might need to pay a little more attention to that if for no other reason than just to have the option allottee to look a little better when I'm 80 then I'm probably on the course to looking Brett does a great job here explaining why our faces change over time what he considers the three most important tools for skin care and rejuvenation he gets into all the procedures as I mentioned the lasers the peels the needles the devices I really enjoyed his discussion of the right way to do Botox because I'd heard this before because of course Brett and

[00:04:08] I had discussed this a lot but I I'm glad we were able to sort of revisit that for people here and he also talks a little bit about the current trends and future trends of cosmetic and plastic surgery you can follow Brett on Instagram he's doctor countless dr K OTL us where he puts up lots of before-and-after especially around the eyes which I find particularly interesting that's something about my self that I've always been curious about making better and his website has the same URL lastly you can see some stuff in the show notes here I asked for Brett to give us kind of his recommendations on products that he suggests that his patients get that if anyone is interested in they'll at least be able to sort of get that and you can see that at Peter attea MV com forward slash podcast so without further delay here's my conversation with dr. Brett Carlos well I'd like to welcome to the show today dr. Brett countless who is an oculoplastic guru and also a close friend of mine Brett we met what about three years ago I would say maybe it's two okay yeah it just seems like we've known each other a long time the first time we met I remember being really impressed by kind of the nuance of your training thank you I tend to think and talk a lot about longevity but I don't tend to think and talk a lot about or know anything about looking younger and you have learned an awful lot about that so remind me how how did you train what was your medical training when I was in medical school I was drawn to this specialized field that was sort of a cross between ophthalmology and plastic surgery and it's called oculoplastic surgery I was watching this doctor do an orbital tumor resection and so I decided this is what I want to do and I learned that I needed to do a residency in ophthalmology before I can do a fellowship in oculoplastic surgery which the field basically revolves around the eyes in the face and plastic procedures related to that so I found out that I had to do an ophthalmology residency first so I did that and then I matched in this training program the match process is sort of like of the medical matchmakers and you are assigned to a program based on a ranking system which you've been through that as well and

[00:06:36] I matched with this doctor and Tucson who happened to have transitioned his practice into cosmetic surgery and so when I arrived I thought I was going to be doing mostly orbital tumors and tear duct surgery and eyelid reconstruction and that was part of what we did but we were also doing a lot of facelifts and fat grafting and liposuction and lasers and so my fellowship training qualified for two different organizations the

[00:07:07] American Society of oculoplastic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and then also the American Academy of cosmetic surgery so when I finished my fellowship I ended up working in this practice in Michigan that was the largest medical spa in the Midwest and it was an exposure to even more lasers and more technology that was on the cutting edge of what doctors are doing for our appearance I remember one of the things that really surprised me when we spoke was just understanding that basically anybody with an MD can hang a shingle and do kind of whatever the heck they want with respect to facial plastic stuff I mean anybody can be injecting Botox and fillers and all of these things and of course not everybody's doing this stuff well and not everybody's doing this stuff with the eye towards how will this look down the road right and I think your approach seemed very nuanced and sophisticated so

[00:08:05] I hope to certainly touch on that today but I kind of want to start with some just fundamentals so I saw a picture of myself 20 years ago meaning I recently saw a picture of myself from 20 years ago and I was like God you were like a better looking dude back then why is it that at 25 I looked better than 45 and part of it I think is just my skin looked so much better so even though by most people's standards are not an old guy today clearly my skin doesn't look like it used to what has changed it's interesting because there does happen to be a double standard for men and women and we have the benefit of looking more distinguished as we age so it's I don't think all men feel that way that we're looking worse as we age but we certainly we're faces are changing and there are some aging changes that are intrinsic and some that are extrinsic right so your genetics you're programmed to have certain changes over your lifespan right your we lose bone as we age which happens in our faces we are losing facial fat as we age and in some ways we're losing it in maybe the wrong places and the Sun that we're exposed to over many many years causes something called solar alas ptosis so we are losing collagen and elastin the thickness of our skin is decreasing in many areas and we're also gaining small blood vessels the telangiectasias and we are gaining brown spots and the combination of these things on every layer your skin your fat your muscle your bone the ligaments that connect the interplay between these layers are all losing support and they're getting thinner and they're degrading so from the time that you're born until now you started off with really chubby round cheeks if you look at your one-year-old son and it's all downhill from there now there seems to be something about the face in particular so I used to swim a lot and I used to swim outdoors obviously so I did spend sometimes six or eight hours just swimming in the out in the ocean and I didn't even bother putting sunscreen on because you know I have dark skin I have olive skin I never get sunburned so I'm pretty used to being the guy that's getting a ton of

[00:10:32] Sun and while I accept that that's probably caused some damage to my face why does it not seem to have caused that same damage to say my back which was even more exposed to the Sun when you know I'm swimming in a prone position well if you think about the tension at play and based on your face and your back I mean they're they're different so your face has more movement but there's also because you need to move in certain ways there's also more areas of laxity whereas your back the skin is stretched and it's taut even though you can certainly get brown spots and wrinkles on your back think about scars on the back tend to spread they look wide and stretched and they don't heal well because it's under constant tension but I think that tension makes the back skin look different than the facial skin but you also have different oil glands in different parts of your body so you have a higher density of sebaceous glands in your face and the must look muscular expression I think it affects the way that you age more than it does in other areas now I read once that by about the age of 35 you you'll lose about 10% of the fat in your face which is kind of amazing to me given that by the age of 35 I probably gained 10% of the fat in my body what is it about the face that doesn't do what the rest of the body does which is accumulate fat yeah well I think there's probably local hormone effects that are making you accumulate in other areas and in the face we have the fat cells come from different embryologic origins and for some reason that's what's happening there and you're talking about very small amounts of fat so you'll see those small differences but think about your facial fat as insulation and as you lose that insulation you start to see the structures that are underlying the surface and so you can see where the ligaments are tethered and you can see the places where they're not tethered which would be an outpouching and so all of those tight areas opposed and just directly next to the areas that are not tightly attached you see these contours and so as you age and you deflate and you have gravity pulling down I mean the fact of gravity is real have you ever seen a like a slow-motion video of a runner and you see their face and the way that the face bounces up and down and there's so much force on those facial ligaments and so you can imagine what happens as you're just walking and running up and down the stairs and over and you're smiling and you're doing all these things with your face so there's wear and tear just like it happens on our joints it happens on our facial ligaments have you ever lied down on your back and take a picture and then stand up and take a photo that lying down image that eliminates the effect of gravity on your face and that shows you what is gravity doing in combination with the deflation so that's how you take a selfie is when you're lying down and take a lying-down selfie yeah there's tip number one antigravity selfie in longevity

[00:13:36] I used to use to I still do and I'm gonna certainly don't that don't deserve credit for the smarter people than me have said this first but the joke is the most important thing you can do to live longer is choose the right parents so there are lots of things that you can do to live longer but genes really play a role now in the longevity space we have a pretty good sense of what those genes are there are somewhere between about eight and twelve genes that offer pretty remarkable protection in delaying the onset of chronic disease and therefore centenarians people who live to be a hundred or longer tend to be bestowed with a greater proportion of those genes but you mentioned a second ago that genetic factors can also influence these sort of intrinsic changes that occur do we have a sense of what those genetic factors are clearly there are people who just have remarkable skin and they age with remarkable skin and you know you'll see a woman who's 40 who looks like she's 20 and her mom is 65 and she looks like she's 45 well we know that there are some correlations between certain genetic types and certain traits and the way we age I mean if you know I see a lot of people for under-eye backs and it's almost everybody says hey this is this is genetic well yes I know it's genetic I mean your parents have it you came in with your mom and she has it too so the structure of your face obviously comes from your appearance but when we talk about skin types in the skin color darker skin types tend to have more connective tissue or denser connective tissue and tend to look better as they age so maybe it's a generalization but a lot of Asians in my practice tend to look better longer darker skinned individuals the same thing and so that darker pigment and skin does give you some UV protection doesn't mean that you don't have to wear sunscreen but it offers photo protection and I I fear eyes that UV exposure from sunlight causes fat atrophy over many many years

[00:15:41] Wow what do you base that hypothesis on we use heat and we use laser procedures in a very highly focused way and we know that it destroys fat cells so these externally applied devices that are available now and they effectively remove subcutaneous fat and I believe that UV radiation does the same thing over a long period of time and if you've seen people that have always protected themselves from the Sun they look like they have white porcelain skin they have less wrinkles and they have younger looking faces I know we're moving away from the genetic question you're asking me but I think you can often overcome many of the genetic things just like with chronic diseases or with your lifestyle modifications but I think that there is also an internal Drive that we have to perpetuate our gene pool we each have our own internal motivation to do that that's just our evolutionary goals and I think some of the more favorable genes become selected over time and so I think there's a genetic motivation for people to want to look good because they want to present themselves in their best possible way to a possible mate kind of like a peacock one of the things that

[00:17:01] I'm sure anybody listening to this and certainly I've always found a little bit I don't know the worrisome is God if I had a dollar for every time I saw someone walking down the street and the hood looked like they'd had a million procedures done and you just feel bad for them you feel like god something went wrong there I'm you don't look natural or normal and I think for many people it becomes off-putting and they think well gosh like I don't want to do anything so it begs the question are there strategies that one should take to consider gracefully aging in as much as one cares I mean look I think in the end some people are going to say

[00:17:39] I don't care about any of this stuff but presumably if someone is still listening to us talking now a few minutes into this they probably care how do you think about this and maybe how does that differ from what other Doc's think or you know what what would be a traditional point of view think about all the people that are walking by you on the street that have had work done and you haven't you don't notice it because it's done well so I think you're seeing that every day but you just don't know it yeah I only see I only see the the numerator I don't see the denominator and one of the reasons for the unnatural appearance why do people get to that point I think in some cases maybe it's unlimited access or unlimited resources I think there are forces that push people in that direction your appearance is a very emotional subject and I think we tie ourselves to that may be an age that we feel like that was our best age I think about the actress that everyone knows for the role that they played when they were 20 years old and in our minds we think of them as that person and it's almost hard for us to imagine them aging and you see them and you're like oh look how old they look and it's it's I think it's a natural tendency to think that because you're remembering that favorite movie that you saw them in but think about the pressure they feel in that situation like my career is based on my image and so if you try to hold on to that 20-year old version of yourself at some point you're going to cross the line into an unnatural distorted look so there's probably a rough guideline your goal shouldn't you know if you want to look your best maybe I'd like to be look a little like seven years younger than where I am now or ten years but if you go beyond that it's a little too much that's one part of it I think the images that we see around us if you look at some of this is part of like what I call the Instagram effect where you're scrolling through and you see these photos of celebrities that have blown up their lips and their cheeks are over the top or whatever it is and some of it is photoshopped but some of it is from medical augmentation you start to think but that's the new normal but it's overdone and that exaggerated appearance that people around you in your circles might be doing some of these procedures and so you all see each other like that and then you want to get a little bigger and just push it a little more and then before you know it you've gone too far and it can be a slippery slope so I think people start to lose sight of where they started and what their goals were your goals may be change and maybe you've found a provider there's a doctor or a nurse injector that said okay you know let's take this a little further a little further and then they say you know I think you're good here let's stop it but you want to go further so you'll find somebody and so you'll you'll get to another provider and they'll do it I personally feel this way if someone comes into my office and they've had something done I think I can fix them but maybe you can't or maybe it's time to say okay let's put the brakes on so I think there's different reasons why people get to that point but the technical reason that someone looks unnatural is when you either try to enlarge something beyond its natural dimensions there's only a certain point is how far the skin will stretch before you start to lose the contours and we say like you can't have light without dark so the goal of your face the goal of a natural-looking face is not to be totally smooth and to have no curves and no shadows and no lines when you smile you're supposed to you see my brow elevate and you see some lines in my forehead you know I'm I'm conveying expression I'm conveying a message to you that I'm surprised or that I'm angry and so if you lose those expressions if you lose the shape of your lip you have a Cupid's bow where it looks like it dips down in the middle or you have two pillows in the butt lower lip and if you distort that by just blowing past all of that and filling it up and so you have a sausage now for your lower lip I mean your eye will pick up on that very quickly that that's not natural you might not know how to describe what is natural but you know what isn't and so you distort the natural dimensions and pulling will achieve the same type of distortion if you go too far facelifts when they're pulled back too tight because someone is being too aggressive on the surface of the skin you see the windswept look those type of things where you know you see it in all actresses or even actors maybe they feel like ok I can spend this much money to look like this version of myself well there's no amount of money that will make you look naturally 30 years younger than where you are you know if you compare I think people's bodies today to people's bodies 30 years ago based on augmentation there are some inevitable trends now I don't have any data to back this up but I can only imagine that breast size is larger today

[00:22:32] I think breast augmentation must be more common than it was 30 years ago when it comes to facial augmentation what are the trends and I'm not talking about - just the extremes where people have like gone too far but it would seem to me that people tend to have fuller lips these days is that would that be true I would say yes and for good and bad reasons I think we recognize now more and more that global volume loss is something that's happening to our faces as we age and that includes the lips so lips can be reinflates volume in a natural-looking way that you wouldn't know about I think that there is a tendency now to focus on these areas so look when you come into my office and you say hey look at my face what should

[00:23:18] I do I'm probably not gonna just say like okay you should do this this and this I'm gonna focus on what you're seeing but I might point out certain things like you know you've lost a lot of volume in this part of your face and I know you're focusing on your your brows first and me let's say but but I see you know I want to maintain a balance so it's been you know popular to fill these nasolabial lines next to the lips you know the lines that go from the corner of your nose to the outer corner of your mouth or to inflate the cheeks but we have to look at the neighboring areas like you're a car guy and you get a scratch on your car well you have to paint the panel's next to it in order to make it look good and so a good provider a good physician will look at you and say okay your concern is your your nasal labial lines but I think we should also just at least consider your lips because let's look back at your photo from 10 years ago and look what your volume status was then and let's look at it now so I think in a good people are focusing on lips but also I think the negative is that there's always going to be some people that are over the top and I see it a lot when you know when you have a lip injection you know typically we're using hyaluronic acid fillers which is something that's a constituent of our skin to begin with so these are very safe in terms of that they're not they're biocompatible there's no allergic reactions to them in general and they're reversible so we have an enzyme that can take them back if there's something that doesn't look right or there's an issue but with these gel fillers they tend to be hydrophilic meaning that they absorb water and for the first two or three days after you do it your lips look like that person that you're trying to not look like take it pretty big so most people for about two days they're sort of like homebound or everything out there wondering if they overdid it yes but it's almost a hundred percent of the time the first time someone does lip filler and they come back and I said okay you were pretty swollen I bet for the first two days and they say yeah but

[00:25:22] I sort of missed some of that swelling and so the next time around we do a little bit more and that's sort of like where you have to determine that's that's some it's a personality thing it's a personal decision in terms of like what is good and and it's a discussion between you know myself and my patient and then we don't always agree like my patient might say you know

[00:25:45] I hear what you're saying you're telling me this is natural I want to go a little further and you know I'm open to that now that's something that doesn't like a facelift once you get a facelift you're kind of stuck with it right I mean a redo procedure there is going to be cumbersome it depends on you know what the reason is for doing you can there's a big role for a revision facelift surgery but you're right when you take something out right are you over reduce the nose or you over stretch someone that can be very difficult to to repair but obviously the hyaluronic acid doesn't last forever right right so if someone is doing whether it's an extreme or incremental strategy of filling how often do they have to do that it depends on the area so you know lips tend to not last as long as other parts of the face like I I do a lot of under eye filler under your eyes you don't have a lot of movement there even though you're blinking under-eye filler lasts you know a year or two years I've seen it last four or five years in some people whereas the lips you're always talking and person your lips and eating maybe six to eight months now you have a very interesting technique of doing the under eye filler which I've sent a number of patients to you because I've been so impressed by just how amazing it looks and how minimally invasive it is what what do you do different there so this has sort of become my niche in my practice and I probably do that one procedure more than anything else and it wasn't by design I didn't plan for this to happen but it was definitely an interest of mine and you know when you look at someone's face the first thing that starts to age is would be the eyes because that's where we have so much movement we're blinking all the time and we have the thinnest skin in our body and combine that with the fat pads under your eyes which can enlarge with time because they have a different embryologic origin and we're losing fat in our cheeks in the upper part of our cheek which that groove where you get that shadow is called the tear trough which I don't really like that term makes me think of like pigs eating at a trough but that trough would be if you were to cry would sort of spill down that kind of slide in the inner corner of your eyes this is what makes people look like they have almost a black eye so I'm rice from this shadow right and people think you know that everyone says

[00:28:00] I'm tired but I'm not and so when you combine the puffy under eyes with the tear trough area you look tired and you might not be or maybe you are be used to want people to know it so what I do with fillers I use a hyaluronic gel filler and I inject it there but with a cannula so a cannula what's a cannula for people who don't know it's like a needle but the tip is dull it's a blond tips needle so what I do is I approach that area from the cheek we make a little needle hole in the cheek and then I introduced this cannula through that little needle hole so you have no needles under your eye and I can use that cannula in a very accurate way and at this point I know exactly where my tip is all the time even though I don't always see the tip I know where it and when I'm doing this I'm imagining the surgical procedures that I do very frequently which is blepharoplasty and so because I know the eyes were so that's a blepharoplasty just means that modification of the eyelids through surgery and so cosmetic blepharoplasty is often either removing the fat pads the bags removing skin from the upper lids or shifting the fat whatever I have to do to make your eyes look younger or the way that they used to look so I do a lot of blepharoplasty and because of that I know what it looks like inside and so I imagine that in my mind when

[00:29:19] I'm placing the filler and I'm placing this gel that takes up space and it's replacing the fat that you've lost or it's also disguising the fat pad that might be bulging and so by putting it in the right place and using the right filler because there certainly there are hyaluronic gel fillers that are incorrect for that area because they just have their own properties the wrong stiffness the wrong amount of water attraction by placing it in the right area and the right amount is rest'll on how your honor-- acid paste filler that's one of the fillers that I use and it's also amount of its having restraint so I understand at which point that this will become puffy or look unnatural and that's where we stop and sometimes we stage it but this procedure will brighten up people's faces who look like they have bags and look like they're tired and it's really gratifying to see what you know people's reactions to this when they look in the mirror especially when you do one side and you look in the mirror and then you see the difference it's pretty remarkable and so it's one of the things

[00:30:22] I really enjoy doing and I think that there's a lot of doctors that sort of stray away from it either because they're not comfortable with the idea of injecting under the eyes there's risks with everything we do to me that's not a high-risk procedure but I think it's perceived as one I think part of it too is this gets back to your unique training I mean you trained first as an ophthalmologist which you know if I think about it like I trained in general surgery like my my scope of what I needed to know was so broad but when you look at someone who's training in ophthalmology like you get to focus five years on like two inches of a person's body so your knowledge of that Anatomy is unparalleled that has an arrow to begin with and then I became and then you become even more narrower so it seems to me that the advantage that you have and this is certainly why I've always felt very comfortable sending people to you is I know that people who understand the anatomy because they've operated they've actually been beneath the surface can do exactly what you described which is they're sort of they know what the art is put it this way when I was in residency there was never any confusion that I would go into plastic surgery when I was in medical school like I just don't have that artistic capacity but I would say you know at the same time you know I like to talk about my skills but

[00:31:34] I don't I think there's like a political part of this conversation where the question is like who do you go to and who's the right kind of provider if you want to do something like this I don't think it has to be a certain person or a certain kind of person I think that there are good injectors and bad injectors I think there's good doctors how can people distinguish so if you're if someone's listening to this podcast and they're saying well you know what these bags under my eyes are driving me crazy let's say they don't live in New York so that you're coming to see you wouldn't even be an option well people come from other places our countries to see me but I think when you're looking for a provider for anything obviously everyone everyone says oh I did my research put it this way if your wife needed a procedure and you decided you know what I don't want to be the one to do it because there's an emotional connection to this person and how would you pick the person that would do this to your wife or your mom I think you have to find out first what are the organizations that certify people from my field and let's say talking about blepharoplasty I think there's a handful of specialists that would be competent you could be a plastic surgeon a facial plastic surgeon an oculoplastic surgeon I have unbiased towards oculoplastic surgeons because that's a big part of what we do I would look at that first references like referrals from other people obviously you know look if you wanted to find out the best surgeon in your in the hospital you probably asked the nurses or the scrub techs and say tell me where the anesthesiologists because they have first-hand knowledge so I think referrals go a very long way and if you know somebody that had a great result or you know someone who's done something but you have to meet with a few people because you might have the best surgeon or the best under-eye injector or lip filler person and that person could also be a physician assistant it could be a nurse I mean I've seen some amazing physician assistant injectors that I would have inject myself you know without hesitation but it's like or do you have a good rapport with that person do you think you're on the same page you have the same goals and style so it's almost like an interview when you go for a consultation sometimes you have to pay for a consultation fee but I think it's worth doing that at least for two or three or four doctors to meet with someone and say I get the wrong feeling here or this office seems frantic or the doctor just didn't even really look at me or listen to me I mean those things I think are all really important so I know doctors that are family practice doctors that are exquisite Botox injectors and so I think it's wrong to fall into the political trap of you have to have this label next to your name or you have to be this kind of like training I think that a lot of the training that I've done was post post your formal trial and some of the training is there are things that I developed on my own but for blepharoplasty rie procedures I recommend looking at the oculoplastic organization but for things in general I think you should look you look at photos of people all have their galleries online they're going to show you their best work so you look at those pictures and you say oh those look good or and some I look at some well-known doctors and surgeons and I look at their photos and then I think this does not look good to me at all I don't think this is natural and they're promoting it as their best work there are a lot of things that I see around the eyes where you know I preserve fat and sometimes

[00:34:53] I'm often adding fat which a lot of people don't like to do because they don't maybe have the same philosophy that I do but I see hollowed out eyes and people are pushing that putting that forward is that there this is my best blepharoplasty maybe for someone that is maybe that's the look they're going for you should want to ask how many procedures the person has done is there a certain number above which you sort of hit that threshold of okay now I've really you should ask all of these questions like how many procedures I mean look I've done well over a thousand two thousand of fillers blepharoplasty is like it's thousands so but in early in my career I did lots of procedures and was probably hundreds so you should ask and your doctor shouldn't be defensive about those questions you can say hey can I talk to somebody who's had this with you and we do that all the time we connect patients with previous patients who are who are open about it and say hey what was your experience ORS and you say well tell me about the complications you've had and if I get one of those what are you gonna do for me how do you how do I manage that do I have to pay to fix the complication those are questions you should be asking that's such an important thing in medicine in general it's amazing how easy it is to gloss over consent forms and you just sort of list a whole bunch of generic complications but you don't actually talk about what probabilistically or expected complications could look like and to your point what are the next steps so for example you know with breast augmentation I know a woman who had these really horrible contractures develop and I was like god I'd never even heard of that you know I didn't even realize that was a complication obviously I'm not in the loop in that space it's actually a common complication yeah it's about 3% I've learned I think it could be even higher depending on the type of implant in the placement so those are things that surgeons we should be saying to every patient that the 3% is a you know relatively high rate yeah and you're right it could be I mean it depends on the implant so if you're using the different textured implants it could be as high as 5% I mean 5% complication is is really high right one in 20 people who do this is going to have this and a lot of times on reduce it still happens which is not to say one shouldn't have an augmentation but boy

[00:37:06] I'd I'd be very upset if someone I cared about had that procedure wasn't told about that complication and then developed it especially if they required redo redo of course and so that going into it you know let's say this busy surgeons doing 20 breast dogs a week and so one one patient every week is going to have potential reoperation so going in you should know hey I might have to do something else and that's what I think any procedure the risk is relatively low with certain with many of these things and we talk sometimes we're talking about one certain complications might be one in a million and so you don't have to put it's like this is likely for you to have but yes that's part of the discussion so let's go back to Botox for a second I think about like six years ago one of my good buddies from residency who's a plastic surgeon I was just hanging out with him we were just sort of playing patty-cakes one day and he was like hey dude why don't I throw some Botox on your wrinkly forehead and I was like all right fine so I like sat down in his little chair and he whipped out some

[00:38:01] Botox and put like what felt like three thousand injections into my forehead and you know put an ice pack on it went home classic mistake though I think is what you're starting to describe treating your forehead directly well let me tell you oh my god I don't remember how long it took to wear off I think it was about two to three months the most miserable two to three months of my life because this was at a time when I was a very active cyclist and I didn't realize it until of course I lost the ability to do so but not being able to lift my brow meant I had absolutely no way to keep the sweat out of my eyes even when I was wearing my kind of do-rag under my helmet so I couldn't believe how miserable I was not being able to lift my eyebrows so it's uncomfortable and then it's also a dead giveaway so when you look around let's say you're watching the Oscars on TV or something and you want to know which people have had poorly done Botox and it's a lot it's when the the frontalis muscle right which is the only so where is that for the people who are forehead muscle right between the eyebrows and your hairline okay okay so for some of us further back than others but the frontalis muscle is the only muscle that raises your eyebrows so you get those transverse those horizontal lines across your forehead and your instinct it's like oh

[00:39:23] I should do Botox to get rid of these well if you inject the frontalis to degree with the degree where you smooth those lines because you know those lines are formed by the muscle contraction so your muscles don't contract anymore and I said they're the only muscles that raise the brow so now you can't raise your brows in fact they drop but your forehead will be shiny smooth so if you see somebody and they can't raise their brows at all you just see smoothness they were over botoxed in their forehead and we say Botox as a generic term it's actually that's a and there's SVM Jen product right that one is Allergan go to allergen currently

[00:39:58] FDA approved his Botox Zeeman and Dysport so those are all types of botulinum toxin type a there's slight differences in the molecules but they all have the same effect so the mistake that was made for you is going after the horizontal forehead lines and in fact what which seems like a common mistake given on the frequency with which we see this yeah I think people know a little bit more about it now but still I think they use too many units up there so the unit is the strength of how much is being injected but what would have been better would be to inject the corrugator and press Harris muscles which are the ones that are just at the top of your nose but the ones that furrow your brow you treat that and then just a light sprinkling in the forehead so you can still elevate your brows but you weak in that that muscle contraction then over time if you do it a couple it'll last you about four months and then over time as you repeat it then those lines will soften because you're not making as much of that contraction so if somebody comes to you and says Brett when should I start doing this stuff let's say someone takes the long view right someone says look I'm you know whatever I'm 40 I'm 30

[00:40:59] I don't know what the age is but I want to know that when I'm 70 I look more like I would otherwise when I'm 50 they want to take that view which is I'm not trying to look like I did when I was 16 but I want to really take a long view of plenty of iterative interactions are you looking at a magnitude of wrinkling or are you saying you know we start with very very small for example just looking at that area that furrows the brows but not touching anything on the frontalis muscle above it I mean how do you think about this from that standpoint I think we have to think from the beginning that you don't have to do anything right nobody has to do Botox nobody has to even spend this much time thinking about their appearance right the people do it because it's important to them and what's important to you might not be important to someone else so with that aside let's say your goal is to look your best as long as you can you should probably first start focusing on the preventive things which can include neurotoxins like Botox but it should start

[00:42:05] Sun avoidance at a young age you should do Botox or something like that before you start to get etched lines is an etched line one that means when your forehead is relaxed the line still shows right and I think it's okay you know I have some etched lines and horizontal forehead slides in my forehead and I think it's acceptable for me and I'm okay with it I mean look there's a range of what's acceptable I used to look at

[00:42:28] Bill Clinton on TV all the time and I'd see his big eye bags and when I was in my training I'm thinking I would just die to be able to take out those nice juicy fat pads but he doesn't care about them at all right and so it's meaningless to him maybe he thought about it but you know he obviously didn't pursue it so it doesn't really matter if it doesn't matter to you and I think you know it's interesting at the root of all of this is you know why do we do cosmetic procedures and why does some people think it's so important why did people think it's nonsense it's about your confidence it's about how you feel about yourself your self-image and I think that there are some people that will chase after confidence and may never be able to achieve it and it's because of what happened to us in our childhood our upbringing the I guess the stability that we had when we were growing up and it's being able to experience love and your family experience acceptance people that were proud of you people can say that they love you but and if you didn't experience that it's much harder to be self-confident and to have a good self-image and so I think it all goes back to that I think there's a healthy way to do it and I think it's not something that we should frown upon I think is becoming more accepted in our society to to have a focus on how we look and how we project ourselves and I think the best way to do that is to have a healthy attitude about it in terms of look I'm doing this for me

[00:43:55] I'm not trying to impress somebody I'm not trying to fit in with somebody and what's amazing is sometimes a little tiny thing that you wouldn't even know you wouldn't notice it but I see people walk out of the office with a different gait or they're smiling when they weren't before and we barely even did anything but it's a little shift and the way that they were thinking about themselves so it's not so much exactly what you do but how you help somebody to feel better so in terms of doing like a neurotoxin and I like doing your first Botox injection if you're looking at your parents and you see these lines you think I don't really want those lines so you do it before they start to become fixed lines those edge creases you do it before you get that so there's not really an age I mean I've I've injected people in their 20s I've injected people in their 80s I think it's never too late but there's certainly times where it can be too early now have you ever found yourself in a situation where you felt it was unethical to participate in the care of a patient because you felt that they were just being too neurotic or they were asking for something that you felt was too much I mean did you find yourself in that situation all the time all the time I think that's the nature of what I do alright it goes along with it and so the way that you look is tied in very closely to your emotions and when you especially when it's your eyes and I see people all the time that have had poorly done procedures and they're tearful when they're talking to me and I see people I think they're unrealistic and I try to guide them I my goal is to be on their side all the time so in order to sort of focus on overall wellness not just appearance but but there's I think there's a connection between appearance and wellness and if you seem to me like you know there's something else going on here why are you chasing after this this one line when you look anyone who would look at you objectively would say oh yes you look younger you look more relaxed you look refreshed like what are we really talking about here well maybe there's something else to talk about so you're almost having to try to be a psychologist psychiatrist at the same time in a way I mean maybe it's also my my wife as a therapist and so some of that probably has brushed off on me in terms of how important it is having somebody to talk to that's outside of judgment and so I think sometimes people need to maybe it's not just one thing it's both it's having someone to talk to maybe there's some other issues going on and you know what is your goal in doing this let's go back a little bit further let's say someone's listening to this and maybe this is a lot of people and they think looked it's really good to know that there are people out there like you who can do the most nuanced complicated grafting injecting techniques above below the eye the forehead etc but what if they say look I don't want to do anything that I can't do is the patient myself meaning lotions potions behavioral changes let's start you you alluded to son let's start there

[00:47:01] I get asked all the time and I'm kind of embarrassed because I just don't know the answer and I have to say I have no clue I get asked all the time Peter what sunscreen should I be wearing like I feel like it's easier for me to answer like how would you solve the Iran nuclear missile crisis or you know before it like I don't have a clue what sunscreen to wear it's a complex marketplace let's say because the way that sunscreens are marketed the way that the labeling is done can be a little bit confusing and there are technologies that are being employed now that are newer that we don't fully understand so let's so let me start with the first question which is there are some people out there who say sunscreen is horrible you should never wear it I'm assuming you don't think that that's the right approach it's absolutely untrue I mean I can feel strongly enough about look I see a lot of skin cancer and I treat skin cancer and it's like it's obvious and it's been well scientifically proven that there's a correlation between UV radiation and skin cancer all right so I have to reconstruct people's eyelids their faces their noses because they've had basal cells which basal cell carcinoma which is related to sun exposure my wife has had several most procedures where which means a dermatologist with special surgical training has to remove pieces of skin and then there has to be reconstructed and you know I don't think anybody wants to go through that I looked the recommendations the American

[00:48:29] Academy of Dermatology is to protect children from Sun and there's recommendations about levels of sunscreen so you can get your vitamin D even with you're using sunscreen so when we talk about UV they talk about UV a UVB and you'll see these things on sunscreen can you explain what UVA and B are traditionally UV you can think about it as UVA the eight might stand for aging and the UV p is for burning UVB is what's responsible for your skin turning red okay they're just different different wavelength wavelengths of ultraviolet light and when you're looking at SPF they're talking about UVB the way that they determine SPF is they will take a subject they'll do it probably I think you need to have ten subjects this is just done on a person it's not like a laboratory test that works well for this they still use on people so they would put you under a light in a laboratory with UVB and they would wait and see how long it takes for you turn red and then an SPF so that's

[00:49:31] UVB radiation SPF 15 means what do we need to put on you that will make you turn red 15 times longer 15 times long longer to turn red and 30 and and this is messy a silly question but is there an objective metric for what redness is like there's a color you know how like you can define colors by the percent red

[00:49:55] I mean you can measure the you can adjust its it's a purely objective measurement so it's interesting SP 15 which seems like very mild sunscreen still gives you 15 more times so if it takes you ten minutes this is gonna take you to you know what 150 minutes is like to two and a half hours basically if you look at the difference between SPF 30 and SPF 50 you're getting a difference of I think it's like a ninety six or ninety ninety six percent protection against UV during that time versus ninety-eight percent protection so it's it actually becomes less of a difference in protection from those race as you go up higher so over thirty you don't get that much more benefit so at but you should be using at least a thirty but that's talking about UVB if you want to protect yourself from uva and UVB which you should you should be using a sunscreen that says broad-spectrum okay and it's still the same SPF system well no SPF does not apply to uva doesn't measure uva in sectors measurement of UVA so if you buy a broad spectrum sunscreen it will not have an

[00:51:03] SPF number on it or if it has SPF but it relates amazingly it would be okay I got it UVA doesn't cause redness so you can use that test which of the two is more responsible for vitamin D synthesis that's a good question I don't have the answer for you all right we will we will find out the answer to that question at some point that should be known Mike my intuition is its UVA but I I I don't know but both are responsible for skin cancer got it so UVA is can can lead to melanoma now I remember reading that yeah I mean I've read so many things like you should always have zinc in your sunscreen you should never have zinc in your sunscreen so there's other divisions of sunscreen types and so there's something called organic and inorganic which we also more commonly as termed chemical versus physical so the inorganic sunscreens are physical and those typically use zinc or titanium which are metals as a reflective agent and it just reflects the Rays of Sun so those are the ones that you think of like Baywatch and you have like the white under your eyes but they don't look like that anymore because now they have micronized versions of those inks and they have nanoparticle alright so smaller particles mean that it looks clearer you still get a little bit of that lightish I didn't gave you an my sunscreens before Italy you get a little bit of a white issue but it's not like a pasty white those are the ones I recommend because it reflects the light now there are some newer chemical sunscreens that are thought to be safe but there are some issues with the so the way the chemical sunscreens work which are considered the organic sunscreens they absorbed the UV light and they convert them into heat which disperses locally in your skin so if your melasma those type of sunscreens could potentially worse in your melasma and tell us what melasma sorry so it's also termed like the mask of pregnancy you see darkness or hyperpigmentation on the cheeks the upper lip the forehead any disc Romeo or brown spots can be made worse by heat which is why I recommend against some of the chemical

[00:53:11] Sun screens I wouldn't say it's a blanket statement some of the chemical sunscreens also have hormonal disruptive effects which is why they're not recommended for children but I wouldn't recommend it for myself either so what are some may be what we'll do in the show notes will link to like brands that you really really like versus brands that people should really avoid if you're sitting there at the CVS and you're trying to get some sunscreen before you go to the beach are there any ingredients that are red flags that you should avoid so you know

[00:53:40] I don't like Octonauts aid which is a hormonal disrupter yeah I think it's debated and you know how much dose do you need in order to really disrupt hormones but I don't really need that at all if I I just would look for physical sunscreen that has broad-spectrum in at least an SPF 30 that's pretty simple some of them say they're waterproof versus not waterproof is that a gimmick or is that the real deal it's hard to measure the waterproof effect but you they do that the same test but they're spraying down with water in the lab and then they're waiting to see how long you turn red I think the the key is that you have to apply enough most people don't put enough sunscreen on I'm guilty of that as well I mean I was in Florida a month ago and I'm still sort of 10 and I was wearing a wide brim hat and I'm applying sunscreen but it obviously wasn't enough so and you apply every couple hours I mean every two hours you should probably reapply understand I know but if you care about how your face looks then at least focus on that and maybe your hands too and maybe your chat level we call the decolletage like your chest those are the areas that are going to be exposed and if you want to look your best don't forget about your hands because when you're 70 you'll have brown spots and you'll have wrinkly skin on your hands if you don't protect yourself your face you don't want to get wrinkles all right so put on sunscreen wear a hat it has a wide brim and then particularly for women or if you wear a low-cut shirt are you wearing a v-neck t-shirt and put it on your chest are there certain moisturizing creams that people can apply that have sunscreen in them but they're primarily like they're not necessarily sunscreen per se like CeraVe is a product that I have used from time to time it's not a very high SPF it might be a 15 but I really like it because it's odorless like I think part of the thing I hate about sunscreens I can't stand the smell of it and the greasiness of it but the

[00:55:31] CeraVe I really I'm like yeah I can actually wear this yeah I think 15 is probably low look if we're here in New York City and you know you're walking from your home to your office and you're probably getting a blast of Sun on your face I put on a 30 in the morning you can do a trial now you go to your cosmetic store you go to you know your dermatologist office and you ask to try a couple of them and you feel in your skin I mean the technology is getting better and the cents are I think it have a wide range to appeal to a wide range of people you'll find something that will suit you if you look for it what brands do you like I don't necessarily want to promote a specific brand because

[00:56:10] I think that there are so many good products out there if you look at the medical grade brands which are sold in doctors offices but you can find them also online you can find them on some of the online vendors Alta is known to be a good brand MD solar science I like replenish skin suta khals you'll find the long list of potential products I don't mean to leave any out or focus on those but yeah yeah okay so then the next thing I want to talk about this far is just sort of nuts and bolts maintenance stuff is something I've heard quite a bit about and also have tried from time to time is retinoic acid so first of all what is it and why does one use it or how does it work well so we're talking about a form of vitamin A and it acts like a hormone in fact that it works in the intracellular in the DNA level so it's affecting transcription of particular genes it's promoting collagen synthesis it's increasing the turnover of skin cells it's one of the few things that's proven for anti-aging but also for acne so there are a wide range of forms of vitamin A but it's one of the top three things I would recommend for everyone to be using if they are interested in having a skin care regimen that's effective now retin-a cannot be bought over the counter or can it you can get over the kind of retinols okay so the retinol is a less potent version of what you're referring to which is Trenton Owen and do those over-the-counter versions which are obviously less potent do they have the same efficacy or do you have to apply them more frequently they're not as potent but they have less side effects so if you have not used one of these products before and you're looking primarily for anti-aging or Franti wrinkles you want your skin to look younger so it helps that you have less wrinkles it helps reduce pigment in your skin someone who's you've been using retinol from their 20s on they they always look better how often should one use it this stuff can dry your skin out right yeah so it's less drying when you're using the over-the-counter retinol type products I would start with something like that if you haven't done it before and often those have moisturizers or hyaluronic acid or other things in there that avoid some of that drying if you do get dry from that then you can just use it every second or third day or you can do sort of a pulsed treatment where you put it on and then ten minutes later you wash it off so you've sort of gotten a short exposure if you can tolerate that and it's primarily recommended for night time there's a myth that retinol is making you Sun sensitive I mean it's possible because your skin has less pigment in it and your skin is looks younger but it's more that the retinol breaks down from sun exposure right so it because I expect if I always assumed it was for what you said in the first place which is you'll get more burned if you use it in that's okay it's not necessarily true but it is recommended you know we use it at nighttime I use it every night now if you can tolerate that then you can talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for a higher strength and that's usually like point o2 5% or 0.05 percent or 0.1 so I'm up to 0.1 now and I do it every night and I have no side effects but I use just the generic 0.1% right no one yeah that stuff ain't cheap yeah no I know but it's and there's newer generations that also have less side effects but the traditional threatenin works nicely but a little bit goes a really long way I mean you can use one of those 45 grams can last you several months and you put it all over your face yes the other meso for guys so someone like me who's got kind of a beard am I also supposed to apply it over the bearded area that's tough to do the nice thing as someone who shaves everyday that area when you're shaving it you're basically giving yourself like a microdermabrasion so you're mechanically abrading the outer sort of the surface layer of your skin which also promotes skin turnover so you're probably a little bit protected there but I would apply it to your whole face and include your eyelids a lot of people say don't put on your eyes that there's a myth I think that you have skin on your eyes right on your eyelids so that skin if anything it's more effective because that skin is thinner so you might not use it as often there but I close my eyes I apply it to my upper lids I apply it all the way up to the eyelash line so if we're gonna do we've got two things in our tool kit so far we're gonna put sunscreen on in the morning we're gonna put retinoic acid on at night is there anything else that you recommend as part of a kind of overall maintenance plan so like vitamin C would be the third part of the trifecta

[01:00:58] Mayon vitamin C is all vitamin C which most people think of as like a vitamin you take to avoid getting cold so that seems to be kind of bogus so topical vitamin C and this one might be a little bit more controversial I mean it's it's not thought to be controversial because every skincare line promotes their vitamin C and the question is what type of vitamin C is effective but think about vitamin C deficiency right what happens to your skin yeah well you get scurvy you go to college and deficiency right so we know that lack of vitamin C is a problem for the way you look in your skin if you're healthy does vitamin C help your skin well we know it's a very powerful antioxidant so it's scavenging free radicals so it's protecting you from UV damage in that way it also is a cofactor for collagen synthesis it turns out it does work better if you have it with vitamin E but here's the thing a lot of the products that are out there they oxidize vitamin C oxidizes very easily and the l-ascorbic acid which is meant to be it's thought to be the form that penetrates the best and is the most effective once it's penetrated it needs to be stabilized and so there's different patents that are developed by these companies and they sort of have these patent Wars like whose patent is better for vitamin C and they try to protect their technology so other companies can use it you'll find a lot of stuff out there and if your vitamin C can oxidize over time in the bottle that's why they always tend to these things come in very dark bottles right and you keep it in your cabinet Sun damaged skin tends to have lower vitamin

[01:02:30] C levels and I think vitamin C is effective in those cases why can't they just add vitamin C to sunscreen for example I don't know if it interacts well isn't there something about iron that they put in this as well I think the one that you're thinking of that product which is the ce4 look so the C in the e we know are synergistic the freulich acid is just another antioxidant so it's just another form of antioxidant that's added into the mix but the issue is and what I've seen in the literature is that if your serum levels of vitamin C are high then your skin doesn't absorb topical vitamin C very well so we don't know if applying vitamin C topically is preventing you from developing sun damage we know that if you already have sun damage that it helps to reverse it and you put this on in the morning or in the evening I typically do it in the morning but you could do two times a day but I use the vitamin C in the morning and I do retinol at night and then the sunscreen goes on top of the vitamins yes but I don't want too many steps if I tell you you need to do ten things you're gonna stop doing all of them so but if you can do these three things which I think that's pretty easy I you know you just have to think about your senior sunscreen the morning and your vitamin A and you have to separate the time between the sunscreen and the vitamin C so they don't interact the serums the C serums so I usually wait a coupla minutes and when it's dry then I apply my sunscreen and you look this isn't a universal plan for everybody we all have different skin needs and but in general this is a pretty good plan for most people yeah if one does this kind of stuff right they say look I'm gonna put the effort into what I do with respect to sunscreen with topical vitamin C retinol as you you know you alluded to earlier I'm gonna take greater care to care for my skin by wearing a hat that kind of thing what percentage of the benefit is some getting in terms of an anti-aging regimen is that like half the battle right there it will go a really long way

[01:04:22] I've had patients where we didn't touch them with a needle it's been no surgery it's just been recommendations and a directed skincare regimen and look I'm not a dermatologist but I a lot of what I do is skin care using these powerful basics I've seen amazing changes and so when you combine that sometimes with some other concerns some directed treatments and it's synergistic it's even better it sounds simple right but it's powerful I mean I think that makes sense I guess anybody can do those things you do need prescriptions for at least the retinol but I think everything else you but only for the purse Coleman for the high grade yeah right so going back to something we talked about earlier what are some of the trends that we're seeing now and we alluded to at least one of them which is lips getting a little fuller Botox has certainly been around for quite a while now are we seeing people using Botox in ways today that they weren't doing it 10 years ago well yeah I mean there's many more indications for Botox we you know we have non cosmetic indications bladder spasms vocal cord spasms torticollis migraines axillary hyperhidrosis Botox is being used for so many different things and I think we've developed a more nuanced approach to how we treat people with Botox I hope so I still see people I even know Botox injectors that have these like Spock brows you know if you've seen that where do you get the over arched Nicole Kidman sort of had that appearance for a little while not to say that she doesn't look good or you know I don't know anything about how she was injected or treated or not but that look is often not desired especially if he didn't have that look before so I still see a lot of those what I would you know consider like amateur mistakes or it may be just not the field has progressed and most of us have kind of gone along with it but there's sort of a pressure I think for a lot of physicians to move into the cosmetic realm because the world of insurance doesn't reimburse as well as they used to and so we're seeing a lot of new providers in the marketplace and some of them have more experience than others but we do have better ways of using

[01:06:25] Botox using it in smaller amounts spread out over a larger area using different facial muscles can turn up the core outer corners of the mouth so you don't look like you're frowning as much we can reduce a gummy smile by injecting above the lip I can treat the lower eyelids so that you can look like your eyes are slightly more open or we can reduce some of the squinching wrinkles that happen under the eyes there's a lot of ways that we can use this that we didn't use them you know 15 years ago or 10 years ago we've talked about some of the stuff in the past and one of the things that I think

[01:06:56] I've taken away from those discussions is that if you're gonna have this kind of stuff done you really want the person who's doing it to understand the anatomy that's because you can see the wrinkle on the surface but you have to understand that the wrinkle is the product of changes in musculature and connective tissue and fat and I'm sure when you look at a face you actually are almost doing so with x-ray vision right like you're not you're seeing beyond the skin you're seeing everything that's underneath it and knowing that well look if I actually want to reduce that wrinkle I I don't necessarily inject into the wrinkle I'm injecting obviously where the where the muscle is yeah and it's not just looking or understanding it's also asking the patient to move I say okay I want you to frown for me and

[01:07:40] I can touch them I can see where the muscle is pulling and there's a variation in the way that we're built and so your muscle might come up at an angle and might be different on the two different sides so it's important to look at those little differences and to see what's happening not just and people say look I like to avoid a cookie cutter approach everything's personalized it's easy to say that everyone markets themselves it's like oh we offer personalized care right every doctor says that that's what they do but do they you know are they really like giving personalized I know then your practice you're giving personalized care because you're diving deep right and you're you're looking at things you're not just ordering you don't just call a lab and say hey give me a CBC and a chem seven and then I'll tell a patient what he needs to do you're diving deep and so that's truly personalized care and when you're looking at a patient and if I have a fellow following me I sort of have to answer to what you know that someone who's training I sort of have to answer to him to in terms of what I'm doing and if he sees me or she sees me doing the same teacher in the same place and every patient they're gonna ask me like why did you do that same thing you know I don't because and I feel that scrutiny for myself as well that your treatment is going to be different from the other person's because you look different in your body's different in your muscles or in different places and you have different concerns I mean so that's that's what personalized treatment is it's not just saying it on your website one of the things I get asked about a lot by patients and this is why I'm really glad I know people like you because I obviously don't know the answer to any of these questions is my friend got such-and-such a laser treatment on his or her skin and I want to do that and all these different types of lasers and these things say that can you give us the kind of the 101 on laser treatment for skin I think lasers are effective in many ways right and the lasers are getting better the technology is getting better there's fractional technology there's different types of energy it's confusing though to consumers because you don't know are you selecting a doctor are you selecting a device anyone can buy a laser if you have a certain amount of money and you have a certain amount of patients and how much of the work is being done by the laser by itself you just turn it on and just happens or is it the provider selecting the right patients and changing the settings so there's a lot of variables there are some devices that doesn't matter who does it for the most part like the cryo lipolysis right

[01:10:10] CoolSculpting it's a device that suctions your fat and it freezes it at a certain temperature and it uses you know an algorithm to figure out what temperature needs to stay at for how long to adequately cause apoptosis of those fat cells right and so basically someone just has to say okay this is the area we're gonna do it and they stick the machine on you there's a little bit of you know understanding and training that goes into it but once you turn it on it's done right it you sit there and it happens and then you and is this cool sculpt procedure effective it's effective yeah and there are other ones too there's other types of the sculpture there's other devices that also effectively non-surgically can reduce fat and but they don't require a lot of it's not an operator dependent from it for the most part all right so you turn them on and they're good and so you can probably go to most places and they'll do good job for that there's a procedure where they use heat and then there's a procedure where they use cold what is more effective they're both effective there's a lot of devices but the two main leaders in the market are both effective and they're probably equally effective they work in different amounts of time but usually you get about 20 20 percent of subcutaneous fat reduction with that course of treatment so if a person wants to take a little bit of fat off presumably you do this on your belly or you can do it letting your flanks anywhere you can pinch fat you can do it right so it's subcutaneous but it's not visceral fat that's under the muscle but it's the subcutaneous fat and it works well as long as you can apply the applicator there are some limitations but they both the main devices have FDA approval for necks as well so those devices doesn't really matter so much about who's doing it you want to go to a reputable place you want to make sure it's the real device there are like there are Chinese knockoffs that are not

[01:11:49] FDA approved so you want to get the real one you know you can go to there's like CoolSculpting is an FDA approved cryo lipolysis device but I've seen fat freeze or something and it's and then you look into it you say this wasn't even approved by the FDA for marketing so got it so at least make sure you're going with an FDA approved procedure or device there are lasers that work on skin there are lasers yeah what are the skin laser like people talk about like getting their face lasered for skin I've had a chemical peel once a little while ago I was really I mean this has got to be is gonna be but five or six years ago

[01:12:23] I was amazed at two things first of all how quick and easy it was to for this dermatologist to apply this stuff to my face that's the first thing the second thing that amazed me was how red I was for like five days and how I had to like lather myself up in aquaphor and then third I was just amazed at how many sunspots vanished yeah well I mean that procedure it can be very effective there's lots of different types of peels there's phenol peels which can have more risk but more benefit in fact for a phenol peel you have to be connected to an EKG so you don't so you're monitoring for arrhythmias there are TCA peels which can be also equally strong there's a lot of experience that goes into selecting the type of peel how they're how it's being applied how many layers what you're seeing that that is a very for your dependent procedure so is there a chemical peel that you would say is if you were gonna have one tomorrow that you would preference I wouldn't say that

[01:13:21] I think it's that's more of a depends on your skin type there are certain things that are not safe for darker skin types so that's a very specific treatment plan for each so what it's questions could people ask the provider to know that that perm is really what you're saying is you have to rely on the providers judgement very know they very heavily and you can get a burn and you can get a scar so how do you screen out for who the right person is well it's asking you know how many of these have you done can you show me examples and is this safe for my skin type and what are the risks so chemical peels are essentially using an acid or a chemical to burn away the outer layer of your skin that's why you look so red and they go at different depths depending on how many layers of chemical are being applied and what type of chemical and the strength so I can use a 10% TCA peel on you and you'll look slightly red and you'll you know look a little better I can use a 35% and you'll your skin will peel off like a snake so there's a wide range and and might not be safe for all skin types so let's look at me right now

[01:14:25] I'm kind of a olive-skinned dude I've probably got I don't know where I would rank on the sun damage scale but I I would say for you either you're looking at it let's say you want to just do a skin rejuvenation you want to look smoother less wrinkles improve texture and brown spots so we would either talk about a chemical peel like it may be a

[01:14:44] TCA peel of 20% and I might recommend three treatments or we would talk about a laser so the laser does the same thing that the chemicals do except it's using energy to burn the surface most lasers today are fractional meaning that they're not taking away everything like a peel would right lit the liquid from the chemical peels gonna take off all of your skin at least the outer layer in a continuous fashion whereas the fractional laser is creating dots and leaving some normal skin in between so the most common lasers for resurfacing would be erbium and co2 carbon dioxide and again with within those there's different levels and different energy settings and certain patients are not candidates for those in some are so that relies heavily also on the experience of the provider now there's some very safe lasers that are very low grade like a laser like clear and brilliant very low risk at causing a problem for most people and doesn't always have to be a doctor provide performing the procedure can in depending on your state laws can be an aesthetician or a nurse and are these painful procedures do people need some sedation for them usually no I mean depends on your pain tolerance the heavier duty lasers and more powerful are going to require some type of anaesthetic whether it's an injection topical anesthesia sometimes sedation and often we do them in combination with surgery so my patients asleep while I'm layering them we're doing one thing and then we're lasering another that is something where you need a consultation and someone to evaluate your skin type and say okay this is my recommendation for you based on my experience and my knowledge my training but there are also I think when you would you would also lump into that that category would be the energy devices that are now becoming more rampant and these are designed for facial rejuvenation in terms of tightening not the skin surface so the first generation where things like

[01:16:40] Thermage that used radiofrequency or today CL therapy which is a focused ultrasound you're seeing more plasma devices the idea is heat is stimulating collagen synthesis and contraction and tightening and for the most part I'm underwhelmed with these technologies in a way it's almost like you know I kind of referred to like the Emperor wears no clothes right where the doctor has invested a lot of money in this device and so they have some stake in it working whether it does or not and the patient is investing a substantial amount of money potentially for them and so you don't want to feel like you're a sucker and you've spent a lot of money on something that doesn't work but you have to look at the before and after photos and if you have a hard time telling which is which then you're not gonna see a lot is anybody doing anything with PRP in terms of facial rejuvenation P

[01:17:34] P platelet-rich plasma has obviously achieved you know some success although I think it is still somewhat questionable but at least anecdotally there are people who are certainly reporting success in the periphery for example treating orthopedic injuries with it and it started out I think for in the dental realm for dry sockets I mean I think they sort of pioneered PRP in a lot of ways so I didn't know it and

[01:17:57] I think you know here in New York I feel like you can get PRP on every corner now it's become so widespread in medical spas and cosmetic practices because it's so accessible for providers to it's always autologous yes okay of course what that means for people is it's your own they take yours out they spin it they return it versus a low which would mean you could use it from a donor so what are they what do people do in skin with this I think you probably feel the same way as me whenever there's something is like touted as like a as a cure-all you have to be a little bit skeptical all right to compete RP help your joint pain and can it make your skin look smoother and can it replace your hair and is it going to heal all your wounds enhance your erections I know so I think it's a nice thought to think that we have that the magic that we were looking for all these years was inside of us right it's like it's like the end of a Disney movie but is it true

[01:18:55] I mean I'm skeptical I've had PRP injected in my head in my scalp for prevention of hair loss and I'm underwhelmed but I mean think about all right so let's talk about for hair loss the mechanisms that are causing hair loss in men the androgenic alopecia are still happening right whether I do an injection or not so how often are you gonna have to do it if let's say it does work right you're creating what does PRP do I mean there's you're talking about the platelets in your blood which are what is their purpose there they're there to help with injuries all right they they clot they send out signals saying we have an injury here so send more growth factors let's heal this injury there's angiogenesis neo College

[01:19:40] Genesis so let's explain those terms so angiogenesis means recruiting more blood vessels yeah building your collagen more I'm trying to create a scaffolding and a framework to heal the wound so when you have a cut on your arm and your platelets go to that that area and they create a clot they send out chemical signals to also do those other things so we do heal ourselves right and if you're an animal in the woods and you get a gash in your leg then you'll get a clot there and it'll contract and hopefully if you don't get infected then you'll just have a scar so for hair growth if you inject it in your scalp then I think there's probably a role for the ideas that you're creating an environment that will help to stimulate the existing stem cells that lie within your hair follicles maybe creating more blood flow to allow for more hair tor prolong the cycle of hair growth all right so this the hairs grow longer so you have more of them and they become potentially thicker but we still have the hormones of 5-ht is still in that area and it's still fighting in the opposite direction so if you do have a benefit and let's say you do three treatments a month apart and you look a little bit thicker than how often you have to repeat it like every four months or every three months or well that's a lot of work but and for me it was uncomfortable I mean look you can do a rainbow you can you can numb the area by injecting all the way around your head

[01:21:02] I drew my own blood but then I had my dermatologist friend inject it for me but by the time I did that the anesthetic that we injected had already worn off and it was uncomfortable but I tolerated it and I don't think it was I didn't get a great result I think it's known to work better for females but the literature is not it doesn't support it very strongly I think maybe it will eventually we just don't have good

[01:21:24] Studies on it and do you stratify by you know patients that are taking 5 alpha reductase inhibitors so a drug like propecia or avodart that blocked the conversion of testosterone to DHT the hormone that's responsible for hair loss and then you can also apply these topical things like right I mean the minoxidil yeah I mean you can go all in and that probably is better or if you're having hair grafting right like transplants then it's often done at the same time you do PRP so I I think I haven't seen any negative to it other than sometimes I think it's ineffective and I think it's one of those things also like these skin tightening lasers the facelift lasers that I think it's oversold and the same thing with facial rejuvenation you know it's very popular to do this thing called vampire facial what's the so that's taking the PRP which is your you know from your own blood that's where the term came from and this was like I think it's probably like a car - how much blood do they need to do a PRP treatment typically if I'm so and I offer this treatment I don't oversell it but I offer it in my practice

[01:22:28] I'll draw let's say ten vials eight cc vials so a total of let's say 80 milliliters and we spin it down I do a double spin method and then we extract the platelets from we separated from the platelet poor plasma and the red blood cells and then we I activate those platelets that's also controversial if there's a lot of different methods of creating PRP and there's a lot of variety and so that's one of the problems with the studies that are out there that there's inconsistent methods and not everybody is also quantifying how much PRP are they collecting some doctors have counters in their offices and they can say okay this is the concentration I'm delivering but there are different methods and so you don't know what you're getting some people are injecting platelet poor plasma and platelet-rich plasma together and calling it PRP but it's not necessarily so if you're gonna get PRP done you should confirm that the person doing this has a way of counting the platelets not necessarily I think you just have to have a proven method of concentrating the platelets they have to know exactly what they're doing I used to have a lot of experience with apheresis when I was back in the lab and this was super complicated I mean at the time we were identifying we were trying to extrapolate her rather identify lymphocytes so you would put a huge 14 gauge needle in one arm draw a bunch of blood out run through the apheresis machine and basically return everything except the lymphocyte that's serious business like you've got to know exactly what you're doing it seems that PRP would be similar wouldn't it so when when I especially because the platelet on the red blood cell are the same color right so you can easily be confused by color contamination but you can see what the difference is when you spin this down you have a density should separate the red blood cells are all that the bottom section is all red

[01:24:11] I don't want any effect but when I first started doing it I did send the samples into the lab and we got an emergency call in the middle of the night your patient has super high platelets and it's okay we were just checking it but I did quantify it initially I don't quantify it every time because I'm still using the same method but then the question is do you activate the platelets or do you just put them there and hope that they're gonna activate and what do you activate them with you can usually use some form of calcium like calcium gluconate or calcium chloride and so you just and you dilute the platelets obviously when you're in jibt before you inject them or do you inject them in that constant so I go from that a DCC of initial blood draw and I end up with about eight CC's total of PRP and that's fully concentrated platelet there's a little bit of platelet poor plasma in there but I've gotten rid of most of that platelet poor plasma so it's platelets suspended in plasma but it's highly concentrated and many fold more than what you'd have in your serum so the vampire facial what we're doing is taking micro needling pen which is a pen that has 12 needles at the tip that are surgical small needles and these are not reusable they're per patient so it's a sterile setting this pen has a motor and it's going up and down driving the needles in and out of your skin that sounds really Plaza selected depth it actually doesn't hurt like you would think it does you come in and I'll do it I just said on my pass okay but I can do it at a depth of a millimeter I can do 1.5 millimeters two millimeters the deeper we go the more you bleed it doesn't hurt like you think we numb you first with a topical anesthetic but as you bleed from those channels the face looks sort of bloody and I think that's where the term vampire facial came but then we're using the PRP on the surface but also applying it as we're doing the needling to drive the PRP into those chambers is a hollow bore or solid bowl solid born you saw it bore needle creates the trauma and then how do you get the PRP into it so this is variable among doctors and providers but you apply you can apply to the surface and then needle over it the idea is that you're driving it into the channel you can apply it to the channel and assume that's going to absorb because you have no like more porosity and you can also inject it directly under the skin and like a filler

[01:26:22] I'm not a major proponent of this procedure I mean besides infection what are the other big risks of this it's actually a pretty low risk procedure I think the biggest risk is financial loss how much does this procedure cost I would say on average it's about you know let's say 800 to 1200 dollars a treatment for the

[01:26:42] PRP with the micro needling you can spend a lot of money trying to look good huh yeah and you know it's recommended to do it every couple months or do it every six months I mean so I wouldn't say I'm not saying I'm against this procedure but I don't think it's well proven because look it's marketed for wrinkles for acne scarring for hyperpigmentation for anti-aging most of the time so again look at the before and afters because everyone's gonna put their best work out so if you look at the before and afters that I've seen like type in Instagram PRP facial or micro micro needling facial or PRP injections and look at the acne scarring pictures and it's very hard to find good results that are not the result of differences in lighting right you have a you have a shadowy picture before and then you have a front-facing light in the after and I would say the majority of the time any benefit that you're seeing is from that there's some evidence there's some evidence that it does help and on a histologic level yes we're building collagen but has to be significant enough to be observable to the people around you otherwise are we just like making ourselves feel better or are we just jumping on to the bandwagon or we or is it a money grab for a doctor's office I mean I'm not criticizing anyone for doing this but I don't think it's been fully vetted and so I think because it's a relatively safe procedure I think it's overall I don't think it's detrimental but let the results speak for themselves you know is it safe to say then that these are three broad categories of facial rejuvenation you've got the chemical peels where you're like physically applying a chemical to the skin and burning it you've got the laser peels where you're fractionating and selectively burning and then you get this whole PRP vampire trick and micro needling there's radiofrequency needles I mean there's there's a huge realm of devices and there's a lot of money in this industry so there's definitely a drive that's motivated financially for companies to come out with the next thing and they have to sell the next thing to the net to the doctor's office what is the typical FDA approval process

[01:28:51] I mean a drug typically takes more than 10 years do you get approve it's not that lengthy and it depends if there's a predicate device so if there's something that's a similar energy it's much easier and you can usually get it based on the previous device a new device can take longer you know it depends but it could be it depends what it is if there's an IRB study that's been already done it could be six months it could be a year it could be two years but you also have to have an understanding that so just because something's FDA approved doesn't mean that it's effective it just means it's safe yeah so there's lots of devices that I think are bogus and I see them all the time and you you have to look at what's really going on here is it that this industry needs to make more devices

[01:29:33] I and I hate to say that like I'm not trying to criticize my friends and my colleagues that are in the industry but I think we do have to step back sometimes and look at this and say who are we serving you know are we serving ourselves are we serving our patients if I do a treatment on you and it's not that effective are you gonna come back to me I mean you might but if I do it again and again and patients are walking you know that's not the foundation in my practice and hopefully it's not like that for everyone but everyone has different motivations and I would say I wouldn't do something I knew that I wouldn't do on a family member and hopefully that's how most people are and it probably is I think most positions most providers have good motivations but it's not universal and so I think you have to be careful if you look for a device or a treatment it's probably better to look for a provider that you trust than to look for the device

[01:30:23] I mean devices you can find the same devices in most cosmetic offices but how are they being used and and who are they being offered to and are they being selective I mean there's a treatment that I do now that's called threat lifting all right it's a dissolving thread that has barbs in it and we sort of lift the skin non-surgically and more than half the people that come in asking for it I turn them away because I think they're not candidates and I think it's effective in a very select group of people and everyone else

[01:30:53] I have to say I'm sorry but I don't want you to walk around saying that it didn't it didn't work so it's interesting when I was in residency I remember one of the attendings saying something that I never forgot which was he said you know your reputation as a surgeon is going to be much more about the patients you choose not to operate on the patients you choose to operate on now

[01:31:13] I think that's night I didn't really understand that at the time but it certainly has made sense later on down the line which is effectively what you're saying you know if you you only need a couple of times where you've done something on someone who shouldn't have had it done and it can out outweigh the benefits of the you know the hundreds of people who responded well yeah and those are the ones you stay awake thinking about right right we stay awake thinking about the mistakes yeah it's true and hopefully learn from them I mean the other phrase that you hear a lot is like to the hammer the world's a nail right and so how that applies to this field is when you go into someone's office are they are they willing to refer you to somebody for something that they don't do or that they don't think that they're the best person to do if someone comes to me and they want tattoo removal you know I might have a laser that can do tattoo removal but it's not the best one if I'm not gonna do it on my wife then and I'd rather you know I'm gonna send her to my dermatologist friend that has the picosecond laser then I'm not gonna push you into that box so you I think you have to be wary too if you're looking for a solution you have a problem and you want a solution and you go to somebody are they giving you the solution they have are they giving the solution that you need so that could be another good filtering question for patients which is when you meet with the doctors say hey dr. so-and-so what are the types of procedures you typically don't do and you refer out and and depending on their honesty with that you may get you know better insight into you know who they are yeah or if there's a procedure let's say there's a problem that you have and you say what is your solution and say are there other solutions that are out there that you can discuss so in my area of interest which is longevity I spend a little bit of time not a tremendous amount of time but maybe 10% of my energy goes into thinking about the future what are the step function changes what are the things that are out there that are not a part of what I do today because they're not ready for primetime or they're still very theoretical but they're the things I want to keep enough tabs on because I hope that within the next decade or maybe beyond they become relevant what fits that description in your field what are the things that maybe aren't ready for use yet but show promise it sort of makes me shudder to think about the future because I imagine myself 20 years from now hopefully I'm still practicing and I'm gonna look back and think like wow you know we were in

[01:33:40] Plato's cave at that time like we were seeing the shadows on the wall and not seeing the true objects right and I think we are in a sense right I mean what is how limited is our understanding and the things that we we don't know that we don't know them yet and so I think there are things and the things that we're doing today that I don't fully understand like things like fat grafting I use it and I think there's some predictability to it but we don't fully understand why it works and how it works and I think some of that relates to the stem cells the stem cell effect and you hear a lot about stem cells being used for all types of Medicine and it's the same with cosmetic procedures and I do some procedures I think of stem cells like I think of Chevy Chase describing ball bearings in Fletch you know that scene when he's like you know that's all ball bearing guys like it's all ball bearings nowadays and it's like that's like stem cells and ball bearings it's just the same to me it's the cure-all it's the PRP of the future so which remains to be seen how viable it is right it's the PRP of today

[01:34:45] I think look there's something there we know there's something there we just can exactly understand we can put our finger quite on it and there's some good science there now but I think there's definitely going to be something and I have colleagues I have friends that are doing a lot of stem-cell treatments whether it's intravenous direct injections I'm in a sense using nano fat as a stem cell you know that our fat is a rich source of stem cells this is counterintuitive isn't it people have always considered fat to be a totally in there right tissue but it's actually an endocrine tissue that's true right and then why are we going to bone marrow for stem cells when it's left closer to the surface it's right there and it's abundant and a lot of people when I do procedures with fat grafting and I'm thinking hey I'm injecting fat and these fat cells are making them look younger but it might be that the fat cells are not none of them cells at all it might be the the out of a kind or the cytokine maybe it's a combination or when I do what I call nano fat which is the stromal vascular fraction or the the soup that's in between the fat cells and now I inject that with the fat am i supporting my fat grafts with these factors maybe I mean I'm seeing results and we and we sort of look at the literature which is limited and we look at large-scale studies which are also limited and we're looking for answers and doing these things and we try to stay safe but there's definitely a lot to learn when it comes to that particular area right we know that we look at other types of growth factors

[01:36:14] I've seen some promise with fibroblast growth factor which is also an injectable like I consider that a biologic there in fgf world which is the abbreviation for fiber brush both factor we there are so many numbers to them are you talking fgf21 or well this is something that's not even it's not approved in the u.s. we don't have it here there's been studies in Asia actually I don't even know which version

[01:36:39] I probably have it in my notes here because I haven't been able to do it but basically are they harvesting autologous fgf from an individual these are laboratory derived got it so they're basically making fgf as a growth factor and just injecting it correct and is this done in Europe it's done in Asia and what's the indication volume is

[01:37:01] Asian facial volume ization and it seems to have long-lasting results so is the FDA evaluating this stuff now I'm not clear about that I don't know I haven't even heard of any studies I don't know what if anyone who's part of an IRB but it seems to hold some promise I think customization like what you do in your practice and you're going to get down to the specific gene level eventually alright and hopefully we'll be able to have a full map of everything in each we'll know exactly what drug is gonna work well for them and we'll be like that I think with you know cosmetic procedures right what how is your skin going to respond to this laser and what energy setting is appropriate for you versus this other person based on what your genetic screening told us I think that's definitely in the future I think customization in terms of 3d printing bio printing so my let's say there's something you don't like you want to change your ear we'll probably be able to print ears we'll be able to print organs I mean there's no question that bio printing is in the future and we'll be able to replace blood vessels organs skin that just seems so far out I mean as an interesting aside I remember once being in your office and you showed me a bunch of surgical instruments that you designed yourself and had 3d printed and they were just perfect right it was like you've knew exactly what you wanted and you were like well this doesn't exist

[01:38:20] I'll just make it right I mean in the past you would have to go to a manufacturer and you'd have to convince this industry person of what you want to make right make a fab they're gonna say well how many people are gonna buy this and how useful well I don't know it's for me it's useful for me but then they're not gonna make an injection mold from me based on you know let's say the the 300 eyelid surgeon specialists in the country that's a limited market so with a 3d printer I just draw what I want and I have it translated into a digital file and then I print it and there's a place in in Long Island City

[01:38:53] Queens and they make it in stainless steel and then it comes to my office and I'm using them every day and I've sent them out to my friends and that kind of thing but we are in the future we'll be able to make what we want imagine a box that is connected to your computer and whatever you can imagine will be in that box and it doesn't have to be just like in silly like doesn't have to be a Hello

[01:39:13] Kitty made in plastic it can be made out of multiple materials and so you can have imagine your phone I mean I'm not trying to promote 3d printing and it's not my my practice isn't 3d printing but let's say just you pay on Amazon and then you press the button and then it prints the phone in your box and then you have the new iPhone I mean I think that's conceivable in the future I mean it's it's easily conceivable and so the same thing with organs I think there's a big see I didn't realize we could go beyond

[01:39:44] I mean I've certainly seen amazing things in 3d printing where you're dealing with something that's homogeneous but a phone is like a completely heterogeneous thing well you can print circuits you can print in different materials right now you can print in different thicknesses and rubbers so you can have a soft rubber inside of a hard rubber so you can print a let's say you can print a silicone breast implant right and you can make it exactly your shape so I would scan your body well I don't know if you want a breast implant yeah I'll probably pass but maybe you want a PEC implant though and I would scan your body are you saying my pecs sir and inferior you just you can use a little bit of bulk okay I know you did the Joe Rogan podcast so maybe you're thinking it to be a little beefier yeah I think a lot of you for looking too scrawny on that but I could scan your body right with a 3d camera I would probably get some CT scans of you as well to look at your bone structure we would design an implant that was and you'd have you know maybe your left PEC needs to be a little bit higher and your right one needs to be a little more projection and it would fit your body exactly and it would be let's say soft on the inside and we'll firmer on the outside so it feels like muscle but when you press on it's kind of squishy like muscle but why stop there why not just make it out of muscle cells right will create a scaffolding and that scaffolding will populate with cells that we cultured from your muscle in a lab and then we populated it onto the scaffolding and we grow it over a week or two and then we just use a small incision and we implanted in you yeah it's interesting when I was in medical school my very first summer the first lab I worked in was the lab of an ENT surgeon and he was interested in growing septal chondrocytes so taking these chondrocytes these cartilage producing progenitor cells and growing ears and at the time a very very popular paper by a

[01:41:34] I'm trying to remember the name it was Langer and Vacanti two very famous guys in the space from MIT and Harvard and this was the year the year in the mouse yeah and we had that picture up in our lab and you know we were trying to replicate and of course the challenge at the time was coming up with biodegradable scaffolds it has that and of course I haven't paid attention to this problem in 20 years but there are scaffolds now there's people that are printing blood-vessel look but I think it's a big regulatory obstacle I think for me what what I was always interested in was printing in materials that are already approved right like silicone and I think the living cell printing will be there but think about the regulation of if you're in the operating room and you want your tissue printing device you have to approve it for every indication so you have to prove it for making this thing for this procedure and you have to it's it's it's like an endless permutation so the FDA now is looking at 3d printing and they do have new guidelines and regard to that and they're recognizing that this is the future and that medical 3d printing is growing but it's definitely going to happen there's been use of 3d printed implants in University of Michigan for infants with trachea Malaysia it's actually considered to be 4d printing because these implants change over time so the implants can grow with the patient and eventually can reabsorb when some with a baby with a narrow trachea they were building 3d printed cages and suturing the trachea to the cage to hold it open externally and then as the patient grows the cage enlarges and then eventually it can absorb so the application here goes far beyond cosmetic surgery and it'll be unbelievable and I mean it is believable to me but I can talk about it for another two hours it's just it's mind-blowing and it's exciting and it's frustrating because I want the next step and where it takes money it takes time and it takes people that are interested but if somebody's listening and wants to talk to me about developing 3d printed materials for surgical procedures I mean

[01:43:43] I have something specific in mind I've been trying to do that for a while I have non-disclosures with a lot of large companies but it's hard to get someone to invest money and something that doesn't give you a return in the next two years right that's that's one of the I think the struggles well speaking of people contacting you I follow you on

[01:44:00] Instagram because I just love looking at your before after photos and how can people follow you what's the best way to follow you on Instagram it's at dr. cutlass CR coyote lus you can look me up on my website i have some videos and procedures in which your URL it's doctor cutlass Comdr KO TL us but yeah i share a lot of my stuff on instagram i think that's kind of fun because people can give me feedback and i've seen my audience grow and i'm following you on instagram too with your racecars and your my nonsense yeah it's fun i I think you know

[01:44:34] Instagram has connected me with a lot of people that I probably wouldn't have met otherwise I mean the the Internet and social media has has made the world a smaller place in a way look there's a lot of garbage to wade through but it's not all bad I don't think there's anything I do clinically that is really relevant to Instagram was not visual but it is right I mean I think people are interested in seeing what you're doing in your day I'm interested in your routines I'm interested in like oh what is he eating what is he what is that indwelling device that you have that's measuring your blood glucose or what's going on your level you posted that picture on your whiteboard of your like it looked like you're Einstein theories right longevity I mean it's actually very poignant breakdown of your longevity approach and I've seen you working on the whiteboard so I'm imagining you'd writing that and sort of like constructing your book that everyone's waiting for but I think people are looking for insight into your life and into your philosophy and it doesn't have to be I mean for me it's a little bit easier maybe because I can show it before and after but that's not

[01:45:37] I think that before and after is not the important thing the important thing is like the story behind them before and after like this is a teacher and she came to me because she was recently divorced and she's thinking about finding a new partner maybe or maybe just feeling better about herself because she's surrounded by younger teachers like those kind of stories to me are the powerful things and and what's important like what I love about what I do is that people bring me into their lives in many ways not just for an injection but to tell me about why they want to do it mm-hmm yeah you have a video on your website that you produced right right yeah so that was just I think trying to convey my philosophy in a way that I thought was you know more powerful about the stories of people or seeking my help or my advice and so

[01:46:26] I'm always thinking about the next one I think it could do it better but that was a fun project well Brett I can't thank you enough for this I've learned a lot from you over the last couple of years and I feel the same way but I appreciate you taking the time to sit down today I hope that people get something out of this and again it could be as Extreme as they know that they want to do some of these procedures and now they feel armed to scrutinize the providers out there and make sure they're getting the best care possible and alternatively it may be I don't want to do any of that stuff but boy if I can just do these three things you know put my sunscreen on use some retinoic acid and maybe a little topical vitamin C that's gonna make a ten-year delta well thank you for inviting me to do this and for leading the way for many of us in terms of searching for the answers and and also sharing those answers it's great to see you and I will well we'll continue this discussion I'm sure all right see if you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter Tia MD com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
