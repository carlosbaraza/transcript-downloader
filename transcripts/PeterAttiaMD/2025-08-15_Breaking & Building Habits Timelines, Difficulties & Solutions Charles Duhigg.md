This clip is from episode 360 ‒ How to change your habits: why they form and how to build or break them

In this clip, they discuss:

- Forming Habits Takes Time: Developing habits like meditation or exercise can take years of reinforcement and repetition
- Neural Pathways Get Reinforced: As habits form, neural pathways strengthen, making behaviors easier to maintain and harder to undo
- No Universal Timeline: There is no set number of days to form a habit—it depends on the individual and the habit type
- Consistency Builds Momentum: Repeating a habit daily makes it feel progressively easier to maintain
- Different Tools for Building vs. Breaking: The strategies needed to build a new habit are different from those required to break an old one

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this segment of The Drive podcast with Charles Duhigg:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on habit formation and breaking, featuring Charles Duhigg discussing the neuroscience and practical aspects of habit change. The conversation explores the misconceptions about habit formation timelines and the neural mechanisms underlying habit development. Key insights include the permanence of neural pathways created by habits and the distinction between creating new habits versus changing existing ones.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Neural pathways connecting cues, routines, and rewards become thicker over time and rarely thin significantly [00:00:22]
- The "21 days to build a habit" is a myth; different habits have different formation timelines [00:01:04]
- Five categories of habit cues: time of day, environment, emotions, presence of others, and preceding ritualized behaviors [00:04:57]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Focus on making habits easier each day rather than perfect execution [00:02:00]
- When building new habits, incorporate multiple cue types for better success [00:06:02]
- Plan specific rewards for desired behaviors [00:06:26]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For habit change, identify existing cues and rewards before attempting modification [00:07:16]
- Don't try to break bad habits; instead, focus on changing them [00:06:26]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Every day you do it, it will get a little bit easier" [00:02:00]
"We can't predict how long it's going to take. But we do know that any habit can be changed" [00:04:57]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are specific strategies for identifying rewards in complex habits?
- How do individual differences in neuroplasticity affect habit formation?
- What role does stress play in habit formation and breaking?
- How do social support systems influence habit change success rates?

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these sections or analyze additional aspects of the transcript?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] What do we know about the length of time or the amount of friction it takes to create a habit and the difficulty in breaking it? So maybe that doesn't make sense. I'll try to come up with an example. If it takes a long time to really create a habit around exercise or meditation, let's pick something new.

[00:00:22] Okay. So, you know, not a not an easy thing to do, right? But but let's say over years and years and years you take a lot of time to build that memory that muscle memory up. I assume that's creating some sort of physiologic headroom that makes it much harder for you to erode that down. Yes, absolutely. So what's happening when you're meditating is that as we mentioned there's these neural neural synapses neural pathways that connect the synapses associated with the Q and the routine and the reward. They're becoming thicker and thicker and thicker over time. What's interesting is they almost never become significantly thinner. So if you develop a meditation habit and then you stop meditating, your life changes the cues.

[00:01:04] When you come back to meditation, you will fall back into it much more quickly than the average person. So we know that creating habits both good and bad creates this neural pathway that we need to be conscious of. But to your question of how long does it take, the answer is we actually don't know. There's this like old there's this myth or this old wives tale that you know it takes 21 days to build a habit and it takes 30 days to break a habit. What the research tells us is that there is no number because different people have different thresholds and different kinds of habits have different timelines associated with them. If you want to create a habit of eating chocolate, you can probably do it in a couple days, right? like it's an immediate it's an immediate positive response. You if you like chocolate, it's something you enjoy, the cues are plentiful around you, you just put chocolate bars in your house. But if you want to build an exercise habit, it's going to take a little bit longer.

[00:02:00] Yeah. But here's the important thing is that regardless of how long it takes to build that habit or change a habit, every day you do it, it will get a little bit easier. And you might not feel that increase in ease the first couple of days, right? But what's going to happen is I'm going to push myself to exercise day 1, day two, day three, I'm going to relapse on day four, I'm going to not do it. But instead of beating up on myself, I'm going to look for the science to what what what went wrong here? What's my plan for next time? And then I get to day 12 or I get to day 20 or I get to day 365. And it occurs to me actually exercising is really easy for me now. Like I hardly even think about it. It just happens almost kind of automatically.

[00:02:39] Now what about the negatives? Right? So if you take two individuals, one who has been smoking for a year, a pack a day for a year, and one who has been smoking a pack a day for 20 years, is it necessarily the case that the latter is going to have a much more difficult time quitting? Probably. Um because it's a much more ingrained behavior.

[00:03:02] But this is where individual differences come into play significantly because if that per first person if they're an athlete, if they've worked on other habits in their life, if they've if they've strengthened that muscle around habit change, they might be able to rely on that to give up smoking. Whereas the 20 20 year smoker doesn't. But but yes, in general, the longer and more consistent a behavior becomes, the more reinforced it becomes in our brain. And does that mean that let's just assume both of these individuals are able to quit smoking?

[00:03:35] Yeah. It's five years later, both of them are at a bar and they both light up a cigarette. Are they both equally susceptible to relapse or is the 20-year person more susceptible because his uh neural connections are more hardwired? Well, there's a lot of compounding factors there, right? So, so when when the 20-year-old smoker lights up his cigarette, we're focusing on the habit loop associated with nicotine use, but there's probably other habit loops that he has developed over time, which is he might feel much more intense sense of shame over smoking than the one-year smoker. He might have emphyma or developing behav and and those are creating mental habits for him that are counterveiling the the positive reinforcement of the nicotine. So the the answer to your question is it's really hard to say universally. What we do know is that the more consistent a reward, whether it's a reward that rewards a positive behavior or a negative behavior, the more consistent that reward and the more consistent that Q, the faster the habit will take hold and the stronger the grip it'll have on us. But when we're trying to change it or create a new habit, there's so many other variables that we don't we can't predict how long it's going to take. But we do know that any habit can be changed.

[00:04:57] Is there a rule of thumb that says on average it is more or less difficult to break habits than to create habits? Not well. So so the science doesn't doesn't sort of address that question. What we do know is that it takes a different technique to build a new habit than to change an old habit. Right? So if I want to build a new habit, if I want to start running, what I need to do is I need to sit down just come up tell come up with a cue, come up with a reward. Okay, my Q is and by the way, all Q's fall into one of five categories. It's a time of day, a particular place or environment, it's a certain emotion you feel, it's the presence of certain other people, or it's a preceding behavior that's become ritualized. So tomorrow I want to start running. I've never run before. I'm going to I'm going to take advantage of as many of those as I can. Right? So, my plan is set my alarm for 7:00. I want to be out the door by 7:30 running and I'm going to put my running shoes and my running clothes on my floor next to my bed so I see them when I wake up. It's super easy to put them on. I know what

[00:06:02] I'm going to wear. I'm going to ask my friend Jim to meet me on the corner. We're going to run together. I'm creating as many cues as I can. If you can tap into all five, you're you're some of them are going to stick. Yep. And then when I get home, I have already decided what reward I'm going to give myself. I'm going to have a nice long shower. I'm going to drink a smoothie. I'm going to take 15 minutes to check social media or whatever else sort of delights me.

[00:06:26] So that's how we build a new habit is we choose a cue and we choose a reward and we link it to a behavior we want to encourage. But for a bad habit, a habit that we want to extinguish, our nomenclature is incorrect. We often talk about breaking a bad habit, but because that neural pathway exists in our brain, I I've smoked for 20 years. I can't just extinguish that those neural connections. What I need to do is instead of thinking about breaking that habit or extinguishing it, I have to think about changing that habit. And in that case, what I do is I identify the cue that prompts this behavior I want to change. I identify the reward that that behavior is giving me. And I'm gonna simply insert a new behavior that corresponds to that old Q that delivers something similar to that old reward.

[00:07:16] And I'm I'm going to let my brain eventually shift. Keep the habit loop inside my head, but change the behavior, the routine. Yeah. I'm Peter Aia.
