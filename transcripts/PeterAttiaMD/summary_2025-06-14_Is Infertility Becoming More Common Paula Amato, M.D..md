This clip is from episode #352 ‒ Female fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility and PCOS, and understanding the IVF process | Paula Amato, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Infertility Rates Have Risen Over the Decades – Lifetime infertility risk is about 1 in 6, and delayed childbearing plays a major role in the observed increase
- STDs Can Scar Fallopian Tubes – Infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia can travel to the fallopian tubes, causing damage that prevents conception
- Scarring Can Lead to Ectopic Pregnancy – If tubes are scarred, embryos can implant outside the uterus, creating a dangerous condition
- One Damaged Tube Can Lower Fertility – Losing a fallopian tube cuts fertility potential but doesn’t eliminate it, as cross-ovary fertilization is rare but possible
