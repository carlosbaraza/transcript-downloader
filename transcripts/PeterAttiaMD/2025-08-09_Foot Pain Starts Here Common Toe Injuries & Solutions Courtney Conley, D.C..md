This clip is from episode 296 ‒ Foot health: preventing common injuries, enhancing strength and mobility, & picking footwear

In this clip, they discuss:

- Common Toe Injuries & Causes - Chronic ankle sprains and poor footwear often contribute to limited mobility in the big toe
-  Why Toe Mobility Matters - You need 40–45° of big toe motion for efficient walking—65° for sprinting
- Turf Toe & Hallux Limitus - NFL players and others suffer from turf toe, leading to joint inflammation and long-term pain
- Avoid Immobilization - Early intervention is key; immobilizing the toe can worsen neurological function and mobility
- Reactivating Foot Mechanics - Lateral band tension and pressure on the big toe can restore functional joint patterns

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of the podcast excerpt:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment of The Drive podcast features a discussion with Dr. Courtney Conley about common toe injuries, focusing particularly on hallux limitus and hallux rigidus. The conversation explores the progression of toe mobility issues, treatment approaches, and the importance of early intervention. The discussion emphasizes how proper foot care and movement patterns can prevent serious toe conditions and their impact on overall body mechanics.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Normal big toe range of motion should be 40-45 degrees for efficient walking [00:00:33]
- Sprinting requires 65 degrees of toe mobility [00:00:33]
- Hallux limitus can progress to hallux rigidus if untreated [00:07:07]
- Wolf's law affects bone changes in chronic conditions [00:08:28]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Don't immobilize injured toes unnecessarily [00:03:01]
- Perform isometric exercises for pain management [00:03:28]
- Early intervention is crucial for preventing progression [00:02:31]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Isometric contractions for toe injuries [00:05:06]
- Band exercises for lateral and medial tension [00:06:37]
- Calf raises with proper toe engagement [00:06:05]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"I call isometrics my pain meds for my patients" [00:03:52]
"Earlier intervention is better" [00:02:31]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific footwear characteristics help prevent hallux limitus?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] There are a couple other toe injuries that are pretty common. Yes. Let's let's talk about those. Okay. Um so you want to start with howis restrict this is. Yeah. We will see this a lot and I think a lot of it has to do with um poor footwear selections. Right. We talked about the chronic ankle sprains and the inability to you know allow the first metatarsal to drop. Um but a functional hex limitus we need about 40 to 45 degrees of range of motion at the big toe. in order to have an efficient walking gate.

[00:00:33] Yeah, this is this is my only superpower. I'm I'm probably like 90 degrees at my hexock. And you know, excess range of motion is great as long as you can control it. Reigns to be seen. So if I wanted to sprint though, I would need 65 degrees, right? Because you're more on your toes. Yeah. And this is where I've seen a lot of former NFL players who get horrible turf toe that have what literally looks like 10°.

[00:01:02] If you can catch these patients before they've had so there's stages, right? So the what will start to happen is you'll get an inflammation on the top of the big toe. Yeah. Okay. Then and and the is the primary pathology just the repeated jamming of that toe, right? the instability at the the first ray and then you they can't drop the b the first met down so they start to irritate the top of the joint it'll be red it'll be swollen and these patients suffer um I'm on a Facebook group for

[00:01:33] Alex rigidus um it's a support group and the reason I'm on it is because I find it like they're it's a constant battle for these people for footwear because they just need they're like I need a shoe that's going to eliminate me using my big toe because it hurts when they try to extend it. And have these patients all experienced trauma?

[00:02:00] No. If they've had like something fall on their toe, if they've had turf toe, then yes. But a lot of them, this is weakness. This is poor footwear. That's why I think a lot of these diagnoses at the foot can be prevented. This is proactive healthcare. Mhm. You know, I mean, you want to talk about your eggs in your book. I love that story. Okay. There's no better way to stop the eggs from being thrown than by taking care of our feet from the ground up. But I digress.

[00:02:31] So, your is your treatment, let's assume that the trauma was in the past. They're not it's not an acute issue. Is the treatment the same where you know you have to get mobility back by strengthening? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, when I I always say earlier intervention is better. Even if there's been trauma, you do not want to immobilize something. We know that when you immobilize, it starts this cascade where, you know, you start to change the neurological input to the tissue.

[00:03:01] Um, and it it just really will create an environment where movement will be altered. So, even in those initial stages, we're doing like big toe ranges of motion. I mean, it seems so um I always tell my patients if I don't get excited about you exercising your big toe, but you have to be now sometimes remember when I had my little toe injury 3 months ago, which still hurts like not as bad, but it's amazingly sore still.

[00:03:28] Um that first weekend when I was, you know, the thing was black and blue. You still had me doing isometrics. I'm still doing them, by the way. And they do anytime I'm in pain, 5 minutes of isometrics actually makes me feel better. Why is that? I am I call isometrics my pain meds for my patients. Yeah. So tell people what I'm doing.

[00:03:52] Yeah. Tell people the exercise you had me do and why it's help with the big toe. What we'll have if there's um an irritation in the joint, per se. And and just so people know the injury, I had an injury where I got hit on the front of the toe. So, it just jammed the toe back. And I I sent you a photo the next day. The I've never seen I mean, you've probably seen this. For me, the entire side of the foot was just black and blue.

[00:04:20] Um, I didn't I didn't get anything x-rayed cuz I didn't think anything was broken. I was going to ride it out. And within a few days, I knew nothing was actually broken cuz I could touch the bone. The pain all seemed to be ligament pain. It was. And to this day, it's still very tender to touch the side.

[00:04:38] And I think when if someone looks at their foot and they see that, they're like, "Oh my gosh, I better just do nothing." Do nothing. But yes, right away, what we had you do was, you know, put the toe in a in a position of a little bit of extension or something that was comfortable. And then you're basically just contracting on both sides of the joint. So you're pressing down and then you're trying to lift up, but you're getting some type of movement. Um, isometrics.

[00:05:06] Um, the reason I call them my pain meds is I will tell my patients whenever you feel pain, isometrics are safe for you to do because what they do is they decrease cortical inhibition. So when we have an injury, think of it, we'll go to a race car, okay? We have a a cortical accelerator, right? So information coming from our brain and we also have brakes. We want the accelerator and the brake to be in balance of one another. When we have an injury, our brains, our foot's on the brake.

[00:05:42] So, if I'm trying to change my movement or improve my movement pattern, I got to let off the break. And that's what isometrics do. They decrease that cortical inhibition. And to be able to do that right out of the gates is extremely important. Yeah. before the damage sets in and you create a long-term pattern of rigidity.

[00:06:05] Yes. So, when you can find these patients that still have, you know, when you're doing a calf raise, for example, someone who has pain at their big toe, they'll be like, I cannot do that. It hurts too much. It's pinching. But I'll have I'll put a band around their ankle, for example, and I'll pull it to the outside. Remember, that's where peronous longus lives on the outside of the leg. So, I'll challenge it a little bit so that they really have to press through their big toe to keep their big toe on the ground.

[00:06:37] When they do that, they're like, "Wow, that pinching is better cuz I dropped the head of the first." Yeah. There is something so magical about using bands for lateral and medial tension to produce the necessary engagement of the foot stabilizing muscles. when you go and do other things. Yeah. I mean it's the kinesthetic queuing I think is so important. So important especially in those planes.

[00:07:07] That's why the foot's I mean it's this multidirectional like beautiful thing that we can train so many ways. So what else are you doing for the rigidest patient? So you obviously isometric a big part of it. How do you get the range of motion? And how do you slowly introduce that range of motion back if they are in a functional hex limitus which means that they can still um utilize their big toe based on if I increase strength of peronous longus for example if we work on range of motion at the big toe all of those things are key if you don't do it then it will progress into hock rigidus and I don't consider those the same diagnosis hex rigidus there's been so much arthritic change to the joint that now you maybe have five degrees so the toes basically fused almost so rigidous you're associating with the bony arthritic changes whereas limitus is hey your bones you still can anatomically move you are limited because of the musculature and you'll see some type on I And on a film, you may start to see like an exostosis or like liipping, right?

[00:08:28] Because they there is, you know, wolf's law. They'll start to have changes within the bone. Mhm. But it's still a functional joint. And that's when I get excited because I'm like, let's do this. Let's fix this thing because if not, if that progresses to hex rigidess, it's game over. Now our treatment has completely changed. meaning that

[00:08:51] I have to look at putting them in a certain type of shoe that's going to rocker them through their toe because they now have lost 4foot rocker. They cannot rock her through their toe. What percentage of people with house limitus will progress to that phase of disease? Unfortunately, quite a bit. Wow. because this uh message isn't quite out there as much as it needs to be because those two diagnoses are often um married. When people start to see um arthritic change at the toe, they're like, "Wow, this is hix rigidous." I'm like, "No, it isn't. Actually, you still if I drop your metatarsal down, I can still give you 40 45 degrees. Hold on a second. Let's train this thing."

[00:09:38] But without knowing that and you start to have pain at your big toe, the a very, you know, the initial intervention is carbon plate under the toe. So they sell these little inserts where you can put in your shoe so that your big toe isn't bending at all, some type of um orthotic or very stiff shoe. And these patients will be like, "Oh, this feels great." And I'm like, "Yes, because you're not moving it anymore." M but if you stay on that path too long you'll lose the ability forever.

[00:10:11] Correct. And you want to talk about what happens up the chain. When I see patients walk with hix rigidist for example they can't roll through their foot. So they can't push off at 45 degrees out of their big toe. So now what they have to adopt is this is what their foot looks like. So they have more knee flexion. for example, and then their hip has to be hiked with everyction, right? And it's like, what are you doing?

[00:10:41] But, you know, I always want to instill hope because there's always hope. You have to um do that. And even if patients have a fusion in their big toe, even if they have hix rigidus, you've lost range at one joint, but you haven't lost range at your ankle and you haven't lost range at your knee or your hip. those range of motion, those ranges of motion will be compromised.

[00:11:08] But let's just train them. Let's rocker you through the big toe. Let's give you drills to give you knee extension, to give you hip extension because we know you're not going to have access to it any longer. So, let's just give you things to work on. And that's where I think I want the two worlds to marry, right? Like often times there is a time and a place for these surgical interventions, but once that's done, there's so much more that can be done so that we don't start seeing squella of that up the kinetic chain.
