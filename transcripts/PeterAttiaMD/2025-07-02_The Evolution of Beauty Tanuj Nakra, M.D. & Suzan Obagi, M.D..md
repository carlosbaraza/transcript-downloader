This clip is from episode 355 – Skincare strategies, the science of facial aging, and cosmetic-intervention guidance | Tanuj Nakra, M.D. & Suzan Obagi, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Evolutionary Purpose of Beauty – The discussion begins by exploring why beauty might have evolved as a trait related to reproductive success
- Hardwired to Prefer Beauty – Citing infant studies, the group notes that even newborns show a preference for attractive faces, suggesting a genetic component to beauty appreciation
- Universal Beauty Standards – Across cultures, people tend to value facial symmetry, balanced proportions, and signs of sexual dimorphism like strong jaws or full lips
- Globalization & Beauty Exposure – The rise of social media and global travel expands the genetic pool and alters perceptions of beauty through constant visual exposure
- Modern Aging Fights Evolution – Evolution didn’t prioritize looking good past reproductive age

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this segment of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. Tanuj Nakra and Dr. Suzan Obagi discussing the evolution of beauty:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment focuses on the evolutionary basis of beauty perception and how it relates to modern aesthetics. The discussion covers three fundamental aspects of beauty perception: facial symmetry, facial proportion, and sexual dimorphism. The experts explain how these traits are hardwired into human biology while acknowledging the influence of modern societal factors.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Infants show innate preference for beautiful faces (Judith Langlaw study from University of Texas) [00:01:27]
- Three universal categories of beauty appreciation:
  * Facial symmetry (indicator of good development)
  * Facial proportion (averageness principle)
  * Sexual dimorphism (fertility indicators) [00:03:20]
- Modern diet has affected facial development and structure [00:08:11]
- Historical evolutionary timeline for attractiveness was primarily important until age 20-25 [00:11:47]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Proper chewing habits for facial development [00:08:11]
- Importance of nose breathing vs. mouth breathing [00:08:29]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Consideration of palate expanders for children instead of tooth extraction [00:08:29]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"Evolutionarily, you know, mother nature is not helping us with our appearance. Our appearance was supposed to carry us through until about 20 or 25" [00:11:47]

5. **References & Resources**:
- Nancy Etcov from Harvard (Psychology of Beauty expert) [00:00:00]
- Book mentioned: "The Evolution of Beauty" [00:00:00]
- Judith Langlaw's preferential looking study [00:01:27]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. How do modern aesthetic interventions align with or conflict with evolutionary beauty markers?
2. What role does epigenetics play in beauty transmission across generations?
3. How has social media influenced our perception of beauty beyond evolutionary preferences?
4. What are the specific measurements referenced regarding facial proportions across different races?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of other aspects of the discussion?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Is there an evolutionary explanation for any of this? I mean, I I don't know if aesthetics, if you think about this through an evolutionary lens, but I mean, historically, we didn't need to look good beyond our 20s. If looking, if the purpose of looking good was to attract a mate, so again, none of us sitting around this table need to look good in Darwinian terms because we're not reproducing. Do you think that factors into any of these observations? 100%. Yes. And so I I think it's also good uh for the sake of um the overall podcast for us to talk about the evolutionary aspects of beauty for just a moment which could be a whole separate podcast. You could invite Nancy Etcov from Harvard to come talk to you about the psychology of beauty. She wrote the definitive book on it um and summarizes all of um evolutionary beauty science. I have all of my fellows read her book because I think it it's just a a beautiful compendium and um evolution the evolution of beauty is a fascinating topic because when you think back to the evolution of humans, you know, why do we even care about beauty? And so the interesting fact is that we're actually genetically hardwired to appreciate beauty. Um, and so there's this famous study from the University of Texas in the 1980s, Judith Langlaw, um, is sort of a a well-known name in psychology.

[00:01:27] She did what's called a preferential looking study of infants. I don't know if you've heard of this study, but it's fascinating. She took newborn infants who were literally weeks old, barely able to see um you know 6 in away from their face and she showed them pictures that are considered beautiful, faces that are beautiful and faces that are less beautiful. And these newborn infants who've not yet been influenced by society, preferentially we're looking at the beautiful faces. And so that that natural drive for us to appreciate beauty is present even at birth. Does that suggest that be that there is a definition of beauty that arcs time? Because I was actually going to ask a question which would be a great you know detour for us to take after this point about how much is the definition of beauty changing. In other words, if you took Matthew McConna and transported him back 10,000 years ago, would he still be a hunk? Is sort of where I was going. But continue with this point and let's come back to the evolution. That's a great um that's a great question and I would say that the answer is generally yes. There's two layers here. The first layer is the genetic biologic um drive that we have to appreciate beauty in men and women. Um and then of course there is a societal impact that conditions us to appreciate certain versions of that beauty. But the fundamentals are uh have been studied in the '9s. Um and the fundamentals are that all humans across ethnicities all over the world have been studied and they appreciate certain features of beauty. So there's symmetry of the face, um facial proportion, and then um they also appreciate uh sexual dimmorphisms.

[00:03:20] Those are kind of the three categories. And so um symmetry when when a face is symmetric, it sort of conotes if you're out there in the reproductive world looking at the pool of your options. Symmetry means that this individual most likely has had good development and nourishment and is most likely going to have good genetics for me to potentially connect with and pass on genetics together with. Um facial proportion is similar. Um, in fact, um, to to go a little deeper into that, um, averess is really what people are looking for. And that doesn't on the surface that doesn't sound so attractive to be average. But if you take a 100 faces of men, 100 faces of women, and average them all down to a single composite, you will um, average someone who has a little bit of a big nose or a small jaw or some aspect of their their forehead shape. And all that gets averaged down into a composite that is considered universally beautiful across cultures. And again that sort of unconsciously in the mating pool from an evolutionary standpoint is conoting healthy genetics. Um again to be able to pass on your your genetics with. And then the third area which is sexual dimmorphism. We're talking here about strong jaws in men, full lips or big eyes in women. These tend to conote either higher estrogen levels or higher testosterone levels depending on whether you're looking at women or men. And again, that's fertility. That's subconscious communication of fertility.

[00:04:54] So those are the genetic absolutes that exist in all of us on the planet. And then on top of that, as you're um kind of bringing up, you know, social media, you know, in this culture, this particular way of, you know, uh wearing your hair is considered beautiful. Those are conditioned upon us based on society. Um but it overlaps on top of that that underlying genetic basis. And how much can those things override?

[00:05:21] Again, I'll just use examples that we can all appreciate. Like, you know, my my I was talking with my daughter about Cindy Crawford. we were, you know, going and I was like, look, like look at a picture of Cindy today. Look at a picture of Cindy in the mid 1990s. I mean, there's simply no way to describe beauty in any other way. Like you you it doesn't matter what your type is, everybody would acknowledge Cindy is absurdly beautiful. And so you're saying she is hitting it out of the park on those three things independent of what the invogue look of the moment is, right? So if if if it becomes the case that blondes are really attractive, it doesn't matter. Like Cindy will override that. If it becomes the thing that women who weigh 30 pounds are attractive, it doesn't matter. Cindy will override that. Is that kind of what you're saying? If you look at even different races and look at a beautiful person in each of those, they actually all have similar measurements. So there are these masks that you can superimpose onto any image and really dissect down every single angle whether it's the cheek angle, the jawline angle, the shape of the nose, the eyes, and all of you. If you look at that across different races, they all have that same kind of measurement that they hit. Talking about those same the symmetry, the upper third, the middle third, lower third, the face, the fifths going across the face, all of that. If you look at a beautiful person, no matter what race they are, they all kind of hit those measurements. Now, then there are nuances like you said, you change your hair, you change your makeup, you can transform yourself, but if you take someone without makeup and just look at them that way, they all kind of conform to those measurements.

[00:07:03] Doesn't this apply imply that over time beauty should be one of the most preserved concentrated traits of our evolution given the presumably the difficulty in acquiring a mate absent beauty? In other words, does it suggest that if you compared what we as a population look like today in 2025 to what we looked like 2,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, a 100,000 years ago, are we monotonically getting more attractive as a species? Can I jump in on one thing on this? You would think so, right? Because we're selecting the selection should be ramping it up.

[00:07:42] Exactly. So we should be marrying someone that looks better or mating with someone that looks better and having our progyny look better. But what's different is our diet. So take go back a hundred years, 200 years, a thousand years. We had to chew a lot more to really digest our food. We were working our massitors. We were working our jawline. Our pallets were not as high. Our jawline was a lot wider. Our teeth were stronger.

[00:08:11] And then as we have changed our diet and everything is cooked and we don't have to make as much effort to chew it, you actually get more crowding in your of your teeth. Your jawline is a little bit less strong. Your pallet changes. More people become nose brea uh mouth breathers as opposed to nose breathers.

[00:08:29] That changes the shape of your face. And that has been measured anthropologically. And so it's interesting because there's a whole book on breath and they go through the anthropology of all of that and the changes in the skeletons that they've gone back and studied. And so that does fundamentally change. Now we have kids that have to have teeth extracted or we have to have pallet expanders now because we realize when we extracted teeth before we made the faces more narrow. And so now the thinking is let's preserve the teeth, expand the pallet when the child is 10, allow those teeth to come in so there's less grinding uh I'm sorry crowding and then that face will be better and uh stronger jawline. So it is something that we've changed. And then just to kind of head into the area of sociology for just a moment, uh 10,000 years ago, um if you were born in some place on Earth, Peter, your the pool, the genetic pool that you'd be interacting within was tiny.

[00:09:30] You know, there's some um fact that I'm probably going to misstate, but somewhere around 1900, most people on this planet had not moved within 10 miles of where they were born. And now it's totally different. And with social media and the way that we can connect with people around the world, not only because we can fly all around the world, but we're also seeing people on screens, the the the apparent genetic pool of faces that we're looking at has in has exponentially blown up into this very strange world that we're living in in 2025 compared to where our evolutionary biology has taken us.

[00:10:09] And I wonder also at what point in our development did other um I don't want to say higher order but other things became priorities in finding a mate. Like I think for most all of us I think when we were looking for our mate appearance was probably not the top of the list. It was one of the factors. You had to be attracted to the person. But I would guess for all of us it was will this person be a great spouse? Will this person be a great parent? does this person share my goals and values and blah blah blah blah blah. It's hard to imagine our ancestors were were had the luxury of maybe thinking about those things. So, so yeah, all of this is to say it's way more complex today. Um, but it is it is just as to hear you guys describe this, it's entirely fascinating to play the thought experiment of transport a hyperattractive person today back in time 10,000 years. And I would just be so curious as to how they would react to that individual. I think it's a fascinating thought experiment and I think that if they meet those criteria that we're we're defining, they would be considered a hunk or a beauty. Yeah. And then one last thing and then we can certainly move on to the next topic, but um in terms of timing, it is important for us to be evolutionarily attractive historically, not in the modern era until you're about 20 or 25. because we weren't supposed to live this long. One of the um issues that comes up with longevity and and trying to maximize our health span is that we were not really supposed to be living this long and healthy this long.

[00:11:47] And so evolutionarily, you know, mother nature is not helping us with our appearance. Our appearance was supposed to carry us through until about 20 or 25 at which point, you know, your kids are old. you know, most people were procreating at 14 and then at 25 their kids were at the point where they were getting ready to procreate and then, you know, you're led off to let led out to pasture at that point basically. So, so evolutionarily what we do every day um with our patients is we're really fighting biology. We're fighting genetics. We're fighting the unnatural existence that we have as a luxury of being born in this era.
