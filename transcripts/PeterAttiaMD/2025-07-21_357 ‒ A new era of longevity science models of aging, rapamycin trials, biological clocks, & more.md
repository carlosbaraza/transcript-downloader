## Description

Brian Kennedy is a renowned biologist, leader in aging research, & director of the Center for Healthy Longevity at the National University of Singapore. In this episode, Brian shares insights from ongoing human aging studies, including clinical trials of rapamycin & how dosing strategies, timing, & exercise may influence outcomes. He presents two key models of aging—one as a linear accumulation of biological decline & the other as an exponential rise in mortality risk—& explains why traditional models of aging fall short. He also explains why most current aging biomarkers lack clinical utility & describes how his team is working to develop a more actionable biological clock. Additional topics include the potential of compounds like alpha-ketoglutarate, urolithin A, & NAD boosters, along with how lifestyle interventions—such as VO2 max training, strength building, & the use of GLP-1 & SGLT2 drugs—may contribute to longer, healthier lives.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] What do we think is actually causing aging? Can we stop aging? Can we reverse aging? Maybe the most important question in biology, all of the interventions that extend lifespan reduce chronic inflammation. But if we fundamentally want to get to a point where maximal human lifespan is changed and health span is fundamentally altered, we have to bend the slope of that line.

[00:00:21] What is the probability in your mind that rapamy is doing that? We're doing a study like this in in Singapore on humans. Six-month intervention with rapamy. I'd like to just quit my job and do nothing other than these experiments. Did you guys do a study on urolithna as well? We haven't published it yet, but I am happy to talk a little bit about it. We don't have human data, but the mouse data is really good on uriththna. I think a lot of these supplements are impacting exercise, and so it's kind of a a win-win. There's so many ways to just help a person find another 5 years of life and dramatically improve health span. Do you think that immortality is impossible?

[00:01:06] Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia.

[00:01:14] Brian, thank you so much for being here. uh you might actually hold the record for longest journey taken to come to this podcast. In fact, I don't know if anybody could travel a greater distance than from Singapore to come out here. So, thank you very much. Oh, it's my pleasure to be here and I I don't think you can get further from here from to Singapore.

[00:01:34] So, let's let's tell folks a little bit about how you wound up in Singapore. Um I I guess just I'll speed things through a bit, but by way of background, obviously you used to run an institute called the Buck Institute. tell tell folks a little bit about what the Buck is and what you did there. Yeah, it's a it's a fascinating institute because it was really the first institute solely devoted to understanding aging and longevity and it started in the in the around 2000 um with some money that was donated by a woman who died in Marin County north of

[00:02:05] San Francisco. Uh and I was the second CEO there in 2010. Uh there were about 20 faculty at the time all devoted to either aging or aspects of aging, very basic science. And as you can imagine, you know, in the 2000s and around 2010, that was a significant component of the aging research field. It was still a very small field. And so the goal was really to help that institute grow. And it was tough times in the 201s because the funding levels were low. And it was right before the real interest in aging and longevity happened around 2017 2018.

[00:02:40] So, you know, we were really struggling to keep the doors open. And I think the buck's doing a lot better now and as well as the rest of the aging field. At the time that you were there, how much of the funding came from NIH and how much came from either donations or industry? Yeah, it was very heavily oriented to

[00:02:58] NIH and our goal was to get more industry funding. We started seven companies when I was there. some of which are still hanging around. And uh also really tried to ramp up the philanthropy. But you know, philanthropy for aging wasn't really happening until around 2017 2018 when people started really getting the idea that you could slow aging and prevent all these diseases and stay healthy and functional. And so that that revolution happened around that time.

[00:03:26] The the faculty there are it's it's quite the star-studded cast, right? I mean, Eric Burton's there, Judith Campey was there until she passed away. That's unfortunate. So, so I mean, you really had a collection of of um of people doing great work, right? Yeah. Well, Eric came after I left. He took over as the next CEO, but yeah,

[00:03:44] Judy was there, Henry Jasper, he's gone on to Janentech. Um but um Gordon Lithgo and a bunch of other people working on aging. So, it was a good good group of people for sure. What do you think led to this um interest that you've alluded to in 2017 2018 uh in this idea of you know well you you describe it as you see fit but but something happened in 2017 2018 that's that that's brought a lot more interest into the field however one describes it

[00:04:15] I think you just reach an inflection point it's really hard to know what triggers it you know calico started a few years before that you know were Google's alphabet companies that is focused on longevity. Um, you know, they've not been very open about what they're doing, but it triggered a lot of uh publicity for the longevity field. It got Silicon Valley interested. And I think that that, you know, I've been

[00:04:39] Matt and I used this slide that you have aging, you know, pointing to all these different diseases. uh we started using that slide around 2005 and we were making the point around health span shortly afterwards and you know really this idea of preventing disease and keeping people healthy interacting earlier and I don't know I'm so sick of that slide I can't look at it anymore but it's uh finally and and we weren't the only ones doing it but I think there were a few of us doing it and it it it really finally I think helped trigger a movement hopefully. So, do you think the field would have, and these are sort of dumb questions as I realize as I'm asking it, but do you think the field would have accelerated sooner had it not been for some notable setbacks? For example, um

[00:05:26] I don't remember exactly when GSK bought um Rveratrol. Yeah. But I believe it was like around 2006, 2007. Yeah. uh you know I I it was clear to me I think by about 2010 that that was not going to work and and I think it was probably clear to GSK around that time as well. Yeah, maybe sooner. Um so do you think that that type of hype with nothing to show for it was was a kind of a negative uh force in that equation and and maybe this this you know inflection point could have happened sooner i.e. during your earlier tenure there, could it have been easier to to have raised funds if there had been less of those examples?

[00:06:06] I think it's hard to know. I mean, it's it's unfortunate and what happened. I mean, in one way, the investors made money off of that deal. So, you know that in that sense, it was a success, but the what was developed was not going to go anywhere. And that's unfortunate. I think that it probably slowed things down a little bit. Yeah.

[00:06:25] And I think because there's always this doubt about whether you can slow the aging process and so when you have a major you know effort that's triggered around trying to do that even though they ended up focusing on disease and we can talk about the struggles of longevity biotech companies in that way but um when something like that you know fails it probably does slow down other investor interest.

[00:06:50] Today you're um in Singapore tell tell me what you're doing there. So, you know, I kind of have one foot in academics and one foot in the private sector these days. Um, on the academic side, we're really focused on targeting aging. And, you know, and that comes back to what I alluded to with the biotech companies a minute ago. A lot of them are targeting aging pathways, but to raise money and get their drugs tested, they have to turn to some disease indication. Uh, which is um understandable and companies I'm involved with do that, too. But on the that's not what we really want to do.

[00:07:25] What we really want to do is slow the aging process and keep you from getting sick. Uh and so in an academic setting, we can test that clinically. So we basically have a whole range of animal models, a pipeline from yeast, worms, flies, killifish, mice, and humans. And we so billion years of evolution there.

[00:07:43] Yeah. Yeah. We bring interventions in and uh at the right place uh validate them really believing the idea that if it works across different model organisms it's more likely to work in humans and then we design human clinical intervention studies to validate that they're targeting the aging process. I don't think anybody knows exactly how to do that yet including us but we're doing our best and learning as we go.

[00:08:07] How is it funded the the institute you're at? Yeah. Uh mostly through the uh university and the government in Singapore, but we also have some philanthropy and uh we do contract sponsored research to test interventions from companies as well sometimes. How many PIs are there? So I run a program that has about 35 PIs in it. Uh but a lot of them are doing other things. They're not all focused on that one concept I just told you. they have their projects around Alzheimer's disease or we just have this guy Michael

[00:08:36] Chi who's working on sleep and aging which is so underststudied you know and so uh it's kind of like an academic department you know people have their own projects they're focusing on is there any uh department in the at a at a US university that brings together as many people that are focused on specifics of aging this way?

[00:08:58] Yeah, I I don't think so. Well, I although I would say it depends on how you define aging, you know. Yeah. If you if you branch it out to cancer and then then definitely, but I'm not sure if it's this focused on actual aging process. So, let's kind of start with a question that I think we'll end up coming back to because it's so fundamental. Um,

[00:09:18] I enjoy, you know, I I I enjoy going down the rabbit hole of fundamental questions in physics. Um, sounds good. And but we're not going to do that. But but I think the fundamental questions in biology, I think some of them center around aging and and so what do we think is actually causing aging? Okay. So I'm going to force you into physics since you asked that question because we just um had the first ever international conference on gerysics in

[00:09:46] Singapore and it I was one of the organizers and the reason I got behind it is the very question you just asked. You know, we've been debating what aging is. um uh for the longest time and uh you know I think we would argue for two hours in some conference room somewhere in the world and at the end of it we would come up with the definition [ __ ] happens and then you die you know it's it's really just it's frustrating I don't even want to talk about it now and you know Vadim

[00:10:13] Gladishev has uh has been on like a evangelical rant about how do we define aging we don't know how to define it he asked that question at every conference and I I think it's a fair question. Uh, and we all throw our hands up in the air. And so the idea was we have a lot of data now, a lot of human data. Um, and aging researchers are beginning to try to model that data. Uh, but they're not modelers, you know. I think most aging biologists or at least myself, if

[00:10:42] I have a skill, it's intuition. It's not writing equations and code, you know. And but the physics people, the theoretical physicists as especially, they know how to model things and they model things based on physical principles that are that are proven, right? And so we we've been trying to bring these groups together and because

[00:11:01] I believe maybe the only answer to your question is that we have to write it in equations. And so uh early days on that, but I'm excited about where that's going. And do you think that these will be explainable through equations or do you think that this exceeds our level of intelligence to understand and it's really going to be up to a black box that contains a neural network to understand this? And maybe we take a step back actually. So for the listeners, they've heard us on this podcast talk about quote unquote hallmarks of aging.

[00:11:34] Mhm. um maybe explain to people what the hallmarks of aging are, which I I don't mean like list them all, but the concept of them. Yeah, don't worry. I I wouldn't put you on the spot for that. Um but the idea that has been proposed is that there are hallmarks of aging. And why is stating those not the same as answering the question that you, me, and everybody else is struggling with? Well, this is kind of an existential crisis with me because the hallmarks of aging came out in 2014 or 2013 and then I wrote another paper right after that called the pillars of aging which is kind of the poor stepchild of the hallmarks of aging and that was um because there was an NIH conference and there were seven topics discussed and they asked me to write a review on calling them the pillars of aging. So I did but even in that review

[00:12:24] I had the seven pillars of aging but I connected them all with lines because I don't really think that these hallmarks and pillars which are like the pathways in the cell that are thought to be driving the aging process you know inflammation you know epigenetic changes these kinds of things uh they're all interesting to aging and you can modify them or they get modified if you slow the aging process but I what strikes me is how entrained everything is so If you take an intervention like rapamy that slows aging, it can impact all of the hallmarks. Um, and so I don't really I think those are like outputs or ways you can look at aging, but they're not the nobody is really just targeted.

[00:13:05] The idea that you can target each hallmark and then you'll live to live forever is is not going to work because it's really the network that connects the hallmarks together. And to me, aging is a healthy aging is about maintaining homeostasis. It's about, you know, maintaining a responsive network in your body that sort of keeps you in equilibrium, responds to the events that are happening during aging, the stochastic events, the damage that's happening and it keeps you functional and and that network is highly malleable. You can influence that network by drugs or behavior. Uh, and if you do, you get benefit from it and you can read it out as an improvement of all the hallmarks.

[00:13:42] It's not like one thing exercise affects only this hallmark. Um so I think it's the hallmarks was good because it it it drove interest in the field. It's part of the reason a lot of investment came uh in the biotech sector but uh it also is misleading because I think the idea that aging is 12 different things and you just need to fix all 12 of them is is completely wrong. It's really about m your body knows how to function in a healthy way. It's about trying to maintain that and maybe improve upon it.

[00:14:13] So do you look at the hallmarks which I believe have been modified since the original paper and a few others have been added. Do you see an a rank order or a seniority of them in terms of causality? So for example one of the hallmarks is mitochondrial dysfunction. Yeah. Now one could say that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs independent of another hallmark of aging which you've listed epigenetic change. Alternatively, you could say actually it's the epigenetic change that occurs stochastically and that that is driving mitochondrial dysfunction and if you reverse the epigenetic change to the previous epigenetic layout, you will correct the mitochondrial dysfunction.

[00:14:55] How do how do you think about the interconnectedness through the lens of causality? Yeah, I think that the primacy issue is a major one. I I like the idea that mitochondria might have been one of the primary drivers also. You know, every time we do an experiment, we keep coming back to inflammation. All of the interventions that extend lifespan, reduce chronic inflammation or almost all of them. And then every time we create a new biologic aging clock, which we're doing a lot of now in my lab, you know, and we do principal components and figure out what the main driver is, it it's always related to inflammation. uh and so I I think there's something it may not be inflammation may be a response but it's so central that uh a lot of the interventions I think are working by dampening inflammation but to your point inflammation could easily be a readout statement yeah it yeah but it it's certainly when you modifi I think when you modify it you get an outcome you know so it's not just an endpoint that you look at how are you measuring inflammation and maybe walk me through how you're doing it in different model systems. So I if are you studying inflammation in yeast?

[00:16:03] Uh not not so much in yeast but you can study innate inflammation in worms and flies because those pathways the rudimentary elements of those pathways are there. And then in mice you have both innate and adaptive uh immunity that you can study. And so we look at inflammatory cytoine panels and a range of other things in various tissues to see you know how that's changing over time and how interventions impact that.

[00:16:26] And we do that in humans too in our clinical study. And so what do you believe is the hallmark of maladaptive inflammation? Would you do do you think that the hallmark of that is based on immune function i.e. deteriorated immune function andor overaggressive immune function or do you think no the hallmark of that could simply be found in a cytoine uh profile that is not typical?

[00:16:51] I mean this is maybe more of a technical question but it's it's going to become interesting as we move our way into humans. Yeah. Well I think it's central to mTor. Uh you know one of the things we were one of the earliest people to publish was that what's happening during aging is that baseline levels of mtor are creeping up. You can't turn the pathway off. And I think most of the interventions we certain inflammation it's not about doing anything super physiologic with the interventions. It's about restoring the dynamic range that you had when you're youthful. And mTor is a great example of that. I'll bring it back to inflammation. You need mTor on when you wound your skin or you get an infection or you have a big meal in your liver, but you need it off the rest of the time. And when you're young, you're very good at maintaining that dynamic range.

[00:17:42] But what's happening with aging, at least in stem cells, is that the baseline levels of mTor creeping up. People on this podcast are pretty familiar with mTor. We've had David Sabatini on many times, Matt Camberlin as well, but I just want to make sure that for anybody who's here who's either new or forgot, let's take a step back. MTOR is so important to this discussion.

[00:18:04] Let's go back as far as we need to and explain mtor. and talk about complex one, talk about complex two, talk about how one impacts the other. We're obviously going to talk about rapamy in that context, but take as much time as you need to make sure listeners really understand why mTor is so central across all of life that we've ever known.

[00:18:26] Well, sort of our our entry into the mtor pathway was in yeast. This is Matt Cberline and I and so we were screening the yeast deletion set. It's a set of strains which each gene is deleted and looking for once. How many genes, by the way, in yeast? They're about 5,000. And then some of those are essential.

[00:18:44] So, you can't screen those. If you knock them out, the yeast are dead. But about 70% of them, the yeast are still viable. And so, we were trying to find ones where when you knock out a gene, that the yeast live longer. Um, surprisingly, there were like 300 genes that that met that description. And that one thing I learned from that is that extending lifespan at least in a simple organism like yeast and there's also data in worms is much easier than anybody would have ever expected and we can talk about that.

[00:19:12] But that's still a pretty cool tour to force us in the '9s. Right. You guys were doing this in the early 90s. We we did the certuan stuff in the 90s. We did the full genome screen in the 2000s when I was in Seattle with Matt. So uh but yeah it it was a lot of work and we we did it brute force. you had people sitting in microscopes dissecting yeast all the time and I think there were 80ome authors on that paper you know for a yeast paper that might have been a record so the um but anyway we one of the main main things we hit was the mtor pathway and downstream of it is protein translation we hit a lot of things in protein translation and mtor is a nutrient responsive kinace so it responds to the levels of carbohydrates and and also amino acids that the cell encounters and so that fit into the calorie restriction data which I'm sure you've talked about that reducing calories can extend lifespan. So it seemed like it was going to be very central from the beginning in modifying aging. Uh and I think that's proven true. Turning down mTor signaling across a wide range of species extends lifespan. And I think the data in humans is also pretty it's not it's not uh fully validated. But I think that if you alter mTor signaling in the right way, you can probably slow aging in humans too.

[00:20:27] Now, why is it then that the first human brush with mTor modulation shows up in the form of immune suppression? Yeah. So, I think that's a bit unfortunate in a way, you know. So, this this rapamy is discovered on Easter Island and you've probably gone through the whole story of this. It almost I feel like I'm overdue for a retell of it, but yes. Yeah. It's It's one of my favorite. It's I probably top five stories in science, right?

[00:20:55] It's pretty amazing actually. And um I think I read you went Yeah, I wrote a chapter on You went to Easter Island, too. I haven't even been there. I'm impressed. Um we're we're going to go back in 2016. So, Yep. Yep. Um but you know this drug was you know had the ability to kill bacterial cells that was bacteriacidal you know they start with and then they discovered had impacts on human cells and uh but almost got thrown away and then gets restored and and it makes a new life as an immune suppressant and certainly if you use it at high enough doses and you really dampen the ability to activate to you can you can impair the immune system and especally

[00:21:37] Especially if you combine it with cycllosporin or some other anti-inflammatory or or immune suppressant, then it's used for, you know, after organ transplant in those contexts. And do you think that um that it's that necessary combination with one to two other immune suppressants that allows it to shine? And I'm actually not aware of literature that looked at uh rapammune or rapamy in isolation as a as a as a potential treatment for organ transplant patients.

[00:22:10] I I'm not either. At high enough doses, it may have that impact, but I think the side effect profile would be too extreme. By combining it with other drugs at lower doses, I think you get a bigger effect. But I think the main thing for aging is that it's not immunosuppressant. I think at the levels that people are taking it for longevity, which is once a week, let the trough levels come down. Um, and I don't think we're seeing immune suppression in that context, at least not above background.

[00:22:37] So, yeah. And do you what what do you think of the the the window we got into this idea of immune modulation and maybe immune enhancement with that type of a dosing regimen? uh visav the the the paper that Joan Manic and Lloyd Kicksteen published about 12 years ago. Yeah, I like those papers. I I think there's definitely a nugget of truth in there and I think it can protect from respiratory infections if used correctly. So I I still think rapamy is the gold standard for a small molecule impacting aging. At the end of the day, it may not be the best, but right now I think the evidence is still the best.

[00:23:12] And I and I think coming back to the earlier thought when you have mTor creeping up when it shouldn't be that's driving chronic inflammation and then chronic inflammation is continuing to drive mTor. So it's this feed forward circle of disruption that that that connects this nutrient pathway to to inflammatory signaling. So I I think that's one of the earliest events that's happening.

[00:23:34] So let's go back to something you said a second ago which is absent the equations biologists have to rely on their intuition. Yeah. And so if we believe in the primacy of that deterioration, that homeostatic deterioration that you just described, what is driving it? Is this entropy? What what is it that is changing?

[00:23:55] Well, you know, entropy has been used off and on ever since I started in the aging field, you know, it's just a lazy term we use because we don't have something better to say. No, but I think it's I think there's a nugget of truth in that. And and I think ultimately and and I think that you know I work with Peter Fedichev at Jerro uh and I think he's probably the deepest thinker in the aging field in terms of understanding this process of aging at a mathematical level.

[00:24:24] Um my only role in working with him is I had a ma I was a math major. Um, fortunately I didn't try to pursue that, but I survived enough to get a math degree in college. Uh, and uh, so I'm kind of his uh, not whisperer or translator. I take what he says and try to help him reframe it in a way that the the rest of the world can understand. He he really thinks about things deeply.

[00:24:50] Uh, and I think his view on it is that really what we're talking about is resilience. You know, you could imagine, you know, im from an image, you could imagine that, you know, when you're young, you're living in this deep valley, you know, and you do all kinds of crazy things. You get too much fast food, you get sick, you know, and you diverge off the the bottom of the valley, the lowest activation energy, and you're you're biologically you look older, but you're in a deep valley. You keep getting pulled back to health. And so, almost no matter what you do, at least in the short term, you're coming back into health. But if there are hills you can go over into what you would call failure states, which could be chronic diseases or could be some major functional decline. And that doesn't happen when you're young because it's a very steep hill. But these hills are coming down as you get older. And so when you diverge off the healthy state, it's harder to get you back and occasionally you go over the side and then you're, you know, in a in a kind of a frailty mode once you have late later stage disease. So the question is how to mathematically model that and it's you know it's more of a dynamic systems type of modeling and um and when you look at the large data and you're I'm I'm getting to the point where you're going to understand why why I need the physicist but when you look at the large data it it almost looks like there's a linear accumulation of damage in and so what we're doing now is we're trying to measure biologic age from large data sets like UK bioank uh and then we're breaking it down into principal components. And when you do that, a lot of the principal components don't track with aging. They track with sex or smoking or something else. Uh the ones that track with aging, usually there are a couple of them. One of them is the primary driver and it's kind of going up linearly and that looks like damage and that that's probably the main driver of aging. I don't it doesn't have to be damage. It could be stochastic events.

[00:26:48] It could be subtle changes. But when you say damage, do you mean DN like what damage you trying to back off a bit because we don't it it may be a cluster of different types of damage. It may be stochasticity and not really defined as damage subtle changes here and there that each on their own have tiny little impacts, but when they start to add up they they put stress on this network and eventually it starts to break down. And so that looks linear.

[00:27:16] And the problem is that mortality looks exponential. Yep. And so if you model it into a mathematical equation that talks about these valleys going down, that's a linear change. But the the chance the ball's going to go over the hill is an exponential change. And so what I like about it is you can fit human data into an equation that that is compatible with

[00:27:40] Gert's equations and exponential increase in mortality. So I think it's on the right track. I mean there's probably a lot of changes. There's also another component usually in these biologic aging clocks that's age related and it's kind of oscillating and it sort of oscillates around that first component going up. And I think that's why you see these methylation clocks are going up and down and changing and everything. And I think of that component is how well you're functioning at the damage state you're at. So you have all these events that are going bad and that's defining sort of your age. Maybe it says you're 50, but then you can be somewhere between 40 and 60 depending on, you know, how how your behavioral patterns, what supplements or drugs you might be taking. And those things are um going up and down. So that's why when you get sick, you look older and then you get better, you come back down. You're that first driver is not changing. It's the second one that's oscillating. And most of the interventions seem to affect the second one, which suggests that what we're doing right now is all right, I'm going to say this and and then I'm going to qualify it. It suggests that what we're doing right now is sort of working around the edges. You know, we're we're we're doing things that may have five or 10 years impact on health span, which by the way is a revolution if that's successful. I'm not

[00:29:06] I think that's a major breakthrough in medicine if we can give everybody five or 10 years of extra health span but that these things may not impact maximum lifespan in humans and they may not get us to 150 or 200 and the kinds of ways to get there may be a totally different kinds of interventions. So, we're thinking about that a lot with Peter right now. And you know, I I translated my research in the translator is a bad term. I switched my research into translation about 10 years ago because I was like, I don't want to be retired in 80 on a porch somewhere and not have any impact on humans. Uh but now I'm starting to think back a little bit to basic science because I'm starting to think that the interventions that we need to develop if we really want to have the big changes are not being done yet and we have to go back to some discovery science to do that.

[00:29:53] So Brian, there's a lot you said there that's really interesting and I'd like to unpack it both for myself and for the listener. The first thing you said I I want that I actually I'm not sure I understand is we have a linear process of we're going to use the word damage loosely. Um and that over time that is increasing monotonically and linearly and and not alterably.

[00:30:22] No exactly superimposed on that. So, so we have you know damage occurring this way superimposed on that we have sort of cyclic episodic volatile change that probably explains a lot of the difference between two 50y olds that you might see you might see a 50-year-old they look great you see a 50-year-old they look like they're 75 right why and or you might see it even within an individual you know boy at 50 I looked horrible but I got my act together and by 55 I actually look like I did you know 10 years sooner. Okay. So that's this superimposed curve and you're saying look um everything we're doing from a translational perspective all the stuff Peter talks about by the way like wrote a whole book on this topic is how do you impact the oscillation?

[00:31:17] Yeah right. Well, if you sleep this way, if you exercise this way, if you eat this way, if you take this supplement, this drug, manage all of these factors, you are absolutely going to put yourself on the better wave here, right? But you are not impacting this guy. That's what I'm afraid is happening.

[00:31:35] Yeah. Um, but then you said something a moment ago that I just want to make sure I understand. is your explanation for why aging follows a GMert's curve as opposed to a linear curve. Is that all due to the um uh the superimposed wave that goes on top of the linear curve or was there another reason that aging follows exponential Gert's law?

[00:32:00] No, I I I think I had conflated two ideas at once there. So, let me let me dissociate that. You've decid you've described the wave better than I do. So, we'll leave it at that. But I think that you're right. We're trying to get It's It's almost like we're trying to get to the best state we can be at for the damaged state we're in. By the way, I have never thought of it that way, Brian. I love that description. And it's actually what I say to my patients because I get people that come to me and they say, "Peter, you know, I really want to live to 150. I'm told you're the guy." And I say, "Actually, I'm not the guy.

[00:32:35] I don't believe it's possible. What I believe is possible is seven to 10 more years of infinitely higher quality life. And if that's not what you want, if you want something that is far in excess of that, you're going to have to go to somebody who's got proof that they can do Yeah. different. Yeah. And I don't think there is any proof.

[00:32:56] I obviously don't think there is either, but I do leave the idea open that it could be possible. I think it may be feasible to do that, but I don't think anything I don't see any evidence that there's anything that's doing it. Translationally, I agree with you. Um, now I think the linear to exponential is the idea of the hills, right? So, you've got a ball, if you do it in two dimension, you've got a curve that looks like this, and you've got a ball here, right?

[00:33:20] And the damage is causing the the the thing to come down. And so, the chances of the ball going over is actually Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. So, even if you have a linear reduction in the height of the hills, the activation energy will increase probability exponentially over the curve. And by the way, I'm just trying to think through why that's the case. Is that the case because of um is it a V squared problem and getting over the hill if we were to model it out as actual balls? Yeah, I I I have a graph. I I we have a model a movie that really helps people that are not mathematicians. I think both of us are have some understanding of the math but a lot of people don't and I think that uh yeah it's it's something like that. I I think also it it explains very well why you know treating disease doesn't work because you have 50 failure states you can go into and each person based on their genetics and their lifestyle the hill to go over that failure state may be a little bit different. Some sometimes person's not going to go over this one, but there's a chance you're going to go over a lot of different failures, right? And if you block one of them, say you treat diabetes or something, uh it you're still going to go over the other ones, right? And so you have the only way to really slow aging is to keep the hill higher.

[00:34:44] Yeah. So, no, that's that's again that's that's both a beautiful model, a mental model for how to think about it and yet still equally infuriating because I don't know why the walls are coming down. Yeah. Right. Why are the hills coming down? What is the fundamental reason? What's the particle reason for the wall height coming down?

[00:35:07] I think the hills are resilience, right? Even but resilience is the most important resilience. Nobody understands. Yeah, exactly. Uh I I think that res All right, I'll give you a sort of halfbaked answer because it's all I can give you. I think that the um um what's happening is this damage is impacting this network that's keeping you healthy, this homeostatic network.

[00:35:33] And it's in little ways here and there and here and there, and the network compensates for that and does okay. But when enough damage happens, you just can't compensate anymore for events that are happening. So when you get sick, you get some, you know, viral infection or you fall down when you're 80 and break your hip, you just don't have that homeostasis pathways in place to allow you to recover and compensate for that.

[00:35:58] I I mean, that's sort of the best answer I can give you right now. Uh so if you had to guess and I'm hopeful that that the listeners are are with us because this idea of the the linear and monotonic increasing in damage is is the thing that has to be addressed if we're going to make a step function change in human longevity. Right? So we're we're I like how you described it.

[00:36:23] We're really tinkering around the edges. Yeah. Right. Everything we do is tinkering around the edges. Um but if we fundamentally want to get to a point where maximal human lifespan is changed and health span is fundamentally altered we have to bend the slope of that line. So my first question for you is what is the probability in your mind that rapamy is doing that based on what you've seen in animal models?

[00:36:49] Well okay so first of all if you look at something like a worm I think that the the modeling is very different there. Worms are just kind of already in a failure state. They're they're like designed to last for two weeks and they don't have that homeostasis that that humans have. And so you can get huge fooled by interventions there. Yep.

[00:37:09] In worms or are or other organisms that um don't the pathway may translate to humans, but the effect size in humans is going to be much smaller. I suspect that's what raphamy is that it's uh it's going to give you a healthier period if you take it the right way or I don't think any intervention is going to affect everybody okay but a majority of people may benefit from that but I think it's in the modest effect and size not in the change the hill not change slope okay

[00:37:39] I want to come back and talk more about rapa and mtour because you're again one of the few people along with Matt David people who can really talk in depth about it but um let's now stay in the world of specul population if you if you had to even imagine something that can change the slope of the line i.e. can take uh I guess we define maximal lifespan as the 90th percentile of of lifespan. So let's just make a number up and say maximal human lifespan today is I don't know 105 maybe something like that. Okay. Um 120 is the is the 99.999. Yeah. Exactly. So, so, uh, we're going to take 90th percentile human lifespan up by 25 years. If I told you, Brian, um, you might not be alive to see it, nor will I, but I have a crystal ball, and in the year 2100, uh, 90% of humans will live to be one 30.

[00:38:35] Mhm. And now I say, give me your best guess as to what did this. Is your guess going to be small molecules? Uh, genetic engineering, epigenetic engineering, like where just go down the pathway or multimodal. It's going to have to be 10 different things like how just this is just kind of like the fun sci-fi game.

[00:38:56] Well, I think the scary thing is that that that linear accumulation, it does look like entropy, which in reversing the second law of thermodynamics is we don't have to reverse it. We just have to slow it. Slow it. Even slowing it is a challenge, right? So, um, and if you think about it from a physics standpoint, which I'm getting further and further and deeper in a pool I shouldn't be in. I'm just telling you that right now. But if you

[00:39:19] I'm giving you a life jacket. Just just keep treading water. If you My motto, by the way, with the consulting I do is that I know what I don't know. It's not a good motto for consulting and I've learned. But anyway, um, as you get into the, you know, the physics of it, it's really about temperature. And I don't I don't mean temperature in terms of the temperature in the room. I mean the energy in the system that's driving the the the changes or damage. And the question is how do you lower that? And so maybe what you need to do when you're looking for longevity interventions is not looking for how long a worm lives because the worm is dying for a different reason.

[00:39:57] It's already in the failure mode. It's about how to lower the noise in the system. uh and lowering the noise in the system might be a way of of changing that slope. So that could be transcriptional noise. It could be anything you can measure as noise that happens over time. You might want to try to lower that noise. That's an interesting concept. Now that that may also come with with secondary effects that people don't want. I mean so right there might be a retardation of growth and development early in life and it might be one of those things where you don't want to touch the slope for the first 30 years of life and and you know again where is the point at which which you want to intervene.

[00:40:39] Yeah I and I think that temporal component is really important. It's taking us into a different concept antagonistic plyotropy but people and it is true that if you look at all the yeast mutants that extend lifespan most of them would not make happy yeast in the wild. they slow growth or they do something else affects some property like mating that that that doesn't is not going to make for a yeast that survives through natural selection.

[00:41:01] But if you put them in a lab, they can divide more times. And so a lot of long live mutants have fitness cost. And so the question would be that if you if you target this noise in the system, which is a completely different way of thinking about interventions, um what will the fitness cost be with that? And you're right, maybe you can get around it by temporal things like the mtor pathway. you probably don't want to impact as a child, but as an adult, you know, it's more important early in life than it is later in life.

[00:41:28] It's only important at certain times. So, if you impact it the right way, you can get the benefits without the cost. And maybe you that's possible in this these interventions, but we're so early. I can't even with any confidence tell you what kinds of inter interventions would have that impact. I will say one other thing is that I think reprogramming is potentially a way to um uh mitigate some of the this this entropic change because if you can replace the cells

[00:41:58] Mhm. you're you with new cells those new cells may have some of the damage because they come from the old cells but they they would probably get rid of a lot of the damage too and so that may be a way of changing the slope. So like reprogramming which I think is still very early stage that may be so as a thought experiment if you took um if I could clone you right now or you had a twin let's just say you've got a twin um one of me is enough in the world but you're in Singapore so we're going to have a North American version we're going to have the Singaporean version.

[00:42:34] So so we have two of you and in one of you we're just going to act as the control. We're going to give you some vehicle in the second one. Let's just assume I can use the fidelity of crisper to revert your entire epiggenome in every cell of your body to what it looked like when you were 20. And anytime it gets out of whack, I I smack it right back to 20year-old Brian.

[00:43:02] Epiggenome only. Yeah. Not genome, not proteome, not met, no. I don't change anything but epigenome. Well, those things are going to Exactly. They're going to affect everything else. But what is your what is your guess as to the difference in lifespan and health span of those two versions of you? That's a that's an interesting question.

[00:43:23] Um I think it would I think there would be a difference for sure. I I'm not sure it would be a huge difference. You don't think it'd be huge? I'm not I'm not as sold on the primacy of the ep epigenetics. Certainly you can modify. what would go wrong? Right? So, so, so if you look at, and by the way, I'm I'm I don't know the answer, of course. I'm just kind of thinking through data that I've seen, right? So, if you look at epigenetic code for two different hpatocytes, liver cells, one from a 20year-old, one from a 50y old. Uh, and then and I tell you which one's 20, which one's 50, and then

[00:44:04] I show you a bunch of others. You can always tell which one's the older one, which one's the younger one. It's there's it's I can probably tell that from mitochondria or a lot of other things, too, though. Yes. So, the question is if do you just say is your belief system that just because you revert the epiggenome back to what it looked like when it's 20, it's not going to change gene expression enough to move the needle.

[00:44:26] I think it'll definitely influence gene expression, but there's also DNA damage that's happened. There are mitochondrial changes there. The the question we're asking is if you revert that, how many of these other things can we fix and restore? And that's the unknown answer. I I suspect you would have a significant impact on those things but not fully restore them. I I don't I I think the question of the primacy of the epigenome is an open question. Nobody knows the answer to this.

[00:44:53] How testable is the hypothesis? How would you design the experiment to test that? Yeah, I think that's difficult because if you want to do it in a very direct way, you really need to modify the the factors that are controlling the epigenetic regulation. But there are a lot of factors doing that. It's not just

[00:45:13] DNA methylation, it's histone modification. There's uh there's nuclear packaging and nuclear lamins which are linked to aging as well. And and there's there's not just one pathway to change. So I think from a a real real life standpoint it's hard to think about how you would do that effectively. Um you know certainly I think I think people have really jumped on it and maybe when I'm talking about aging clocks at some point people have really jumped on this idea of epiggenome being a drive the driver of aging because you can get a biologic age by measuring the DNA methylation changes across the genome. Well, I I mean I think they're asserting that that's the case. I I don't see any evidence that that's the case.

[00:45:58] That's that's yeah, we can come to that point. We we we definitely want to dig into this. You can get to that same point by measuring the proteomic changes, by measuring the the microbiome changes, by looking at facial structural changes. Jackie Han's got great data on that in China. So any anything in a human where you have a deep enough data set with that's enriched enough and you have a samples across a wide enough age range you can make a clock that predicts their age and and the the facial clock is about as accurate as the methylation clock. So I think that a lot of people have jumped on this methylation or or epigenetic bandwagon but they're they're taking association and causality and they're making a big leap there. Now we know that you can modify epigenetic factors and extend the lifespan of yeast and worms and flies uh maybe even mice.

[00:46:49] Um so it does have a role but you can do that with celitic factors or nutritional regulators or you know calorie restriction or a lot of other things. It's not clear to me that that's a bigger effect than you're going to get from targeting these other interventions. So So but but to be fair none of them are completely reversing things either. So they they're not addressing your question directly.

[00:47:12] Yeah. Do you believe that it and this is just again we're in the philosophical I'll bring it back to reality at some point today. Um do you think that immortality is impossible unless we define it through kind of like AI copying your brain? Let's put that I mean physical immortality. Do you believe that that is that is impossible?

[00:47:38] Well, I I like to tell people that I'm immortal because I think the mindset that it gives me is a very healthy mindset for me. We can come to, you know, you you talk a lot about the emotional aspects of age in your book. I love that chapter. We can come to that later, but that's I don't really believe it's true. I think the odds that you could achieve that level of change in aging is non zero, but close. So, so I

[00:48:04] I'm skeptical that that can be done. I think it's fair to say, but I I wouldn't rule out the possibility. Of course, nobody's ultimately going to be immortal because you're going to get hit by a bus sooner or later. But what you're really talking about is being immortal in terms of dying from aging. Yeah. What I guess what I'm really saying is, can one ever get to the point where resilience is high enough that you cannot die from disease?

[00:48:27] I have seen nothing so far that suggests that's possible. Okay. But but that doesn't mean it isn't possible. Yeah. And then that gets even to physical frailty and sarcopenia and things like that where even when we see centinarians and super centinarians their frailty is still pretty remarkable. meaning meaning like they still look pretty feeble and frail. Like I mean the age adjusted they're great but at the end of the day like when they're 110 they still look like someone who's in the final years of their life just as someone would if they were 84 85.

[00:49:05] I mean I had two grandmothers that lived to almost 100. One died at 99 and the other 101. And the one at 101 I would say that at 90 she was driving at 95. I think she quit driving. She bowled a 238 game at 93. She was looked like a 93. Yeah. But but so she looked like a 70s something year old. Exactly. My point is she just had a phase shift of 20 years but it didn't undo the inevitability of that decline.

[00:49:33] Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree with that. I I think that you know but getting us to 100's a good goal. I think I I agree completely. Do you think that again we're spending too much time worrying about finding immortality, escape velocity, understanding the core of aging when maybe we should be spending more time on how do we preserve health span in the last decade of life?

[00:50:00] Um why is it that most people in the final decade of their life are physically too frail to enjoy life are cognitively just you know even even absent Alzheimer's disease they're just not cognitively sharp enough they're in pain they've they're fracturing their hips they're not doing what you know what gave them joy through most of their life that yeah I I think that uh we should fund um aging somewhere closer to the level we're funding cancer and answer both of those questions At the same time, I think one of them is a translational question about how do we slow aging as much as we can right now and improve the health of the population as much as possible and the other one is a basic science question. Can we stop aging? Can we reverse aging? No one can.

[00:50:46] If anybody has the tells you they have the answers to that, they're lying to you or they're lying to themselves. Okay? We don't know. And uh I think that but it's it's maybe the most important question in biology and we should be throwing money at it. So, we've seen all this money go into like the private sector side, biotech companies, supplement companies, longevity clinics, and on and on. And I think that's great, by the way, and I spent a lot of my time working with those groups because I think it's important, but we're not seeing the academic funding that's going into the basic science of aging and longevity. And the big questions still that you just raised are still not answered. And so I'm not I'm not I'm I'm changing your your question to a plea for more funding. And unfortunately the the kind of funding that supports that is usually government funding, foundation funding, and and that's under major threat right now. So it's uh I'm really worried that we're not going to answer those questions.

[00:51:44] Well, it's funny. We this was a discussion that came up um on a longevity round table. I think most people, myself included, were really surprised to hear how desperate the funding differences are and how if you could um put I don't know if you could reallocate 10% of funding from the disease specific pools to the age pools um it it could have an enormous difference based on how little the funding. Yeah. Yeah. So when you think about the big chronic diseases

[00:52:16] Yeah. cardiovascular disease, cancer, uh dementing diseases, and metabolic diseases. Right? Those would be the big four. I've often maintained that the that the least inevitable of them is ironically the one that is the most deadly today, which is cardiovascular disease. Yeah, I agree. the athoscllerotic diseases, so cerebro and and and cardiovascular um ironically the most preventable because we have the best understanding of what causes them and we couple that with the most tools to prevent them whether it be uh tools to combat hypertension, dysipidemia, etc.

[00:52:49] And they're responsible to responsive to to lifestyle modification. I mean, which of those major diseases of the other three, dementing, cancer, metabolic, do you believe is the most inevitable to our species? I wouldn't put uh metabolic in that category for sure because I see that more like cardiovascular.

[00:53:10] I agree. Um, so of the other two, cancer and dementing or neurodeenerative diseases, which one is just seemingly inevitable? We don't know enough about dementia to answer, but I will say that cancer is a little bit different than these other diseases, I think, and it's not a it and it may be less modifiable by uh longevity interventions. Um, dementia, we we just don't know. My guess is it's highly modifiable, too, but there's not enough data to be sure of that like there is for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. But cancer is is is an accumulation of mutations. So, it's a more defined event that's happening. It's also a impact on the immune system that's different a little bit than normal aging. So it may be less um approachable from a longevity viewpoint.

[00:53:59] You know it's funny that's exactly my view uh that cancer is the most inevitable of these diseases. Do you think that the inevitability or the age related component stems more from the accumulation of mutations or the weakening of the immune system? It's probably both. I mean, you you don't get to cancer without the right mutations happening. Um, but I think we're learning more and more that the immune system is playing a major role in it and that we can see that very clearly from the interventions that improve immune function and they're having a big role in certain types of tumors and but

[00:54:36] I think that's going to be true for Alzheimer's and the dementia as well. We've completely underestimated the role of inflammation and the immune system and those diseases as well and they may be the primary drivers. you know, I I kind of have got I'm very frustrated by some of these fields. One of them is

[00:54:52] Alzheimer's. You know, the um I kind of feel like, you know, the that one of these Alzheimer's researchers, they're going to die at some point of 90 and on their on their tombstone, it's going to be like, you know, major accomplishment was to completely remove plaques from the brain, died of Alzheimer's at 94. you know, it's it's it's there's been so much focus on one or two mechanisms of disease that we spent 30 years not studying the others, which may be more important.

[00:55:21] Why do you think that I mean I write about it in the book, but I I'm really curious as to why you think that's happened and and because that's not a unfortunately that's not an isolated incident in science. So why do you think it's happening in a field where the results are otherwise so dismal? What's the what's the saying that scientific progress happens one funeral?

[00:55:39] One funeral at a time. Yeah, I I think that's part of it. You know, you get people that that have successful research programs and uh their postocs get hired in all the jobs and and so when you take a field and it grows from a small field to a bigger field, you everybody can draw their lineage back to four or five different PIs and and so whatever models and those PIs get really focused on those models and they see that as their ticket to prizes and things like that. And so then that you you focus on a subset of the disease mechanisms at the exclusion of all others. And I I don't want to single

[00:56:15] Alzheimer's out. I think a lot of diseases meet that category. But it's unfortunate because what we're realizing is that, you know, there's a lot of factors that contribute to any disease. And I think longevity may be an interesting way of looking at it. Like I think it's better like I'll take a take a mouse. Okay? We've tried to make

[00:56:34] Alzheimer's models in mice and they they don't prove that informative. Why? You're make you're creating a disease a mouse doesn't get genetically in a young mouse and comparing that to a natural disease in an old human. I think it you learn more about Alzheimer's. If you look at the brain neurogenic changes that happen in the mouse normally with aging that the downstream things are different but the drivers may be the very similar to the ones that are driving Alzheimer

[00:57:02] Alzheimer's and that may be a better model of Alzheimer's than trying to artificially create something that a mouse doesn't get. So that's what I think aging is helping change that perspective that you know the the drivers of aging I think are very similar between a mouse and a human that the downstream events can be different uh but the drivers are what we care about right so let's go back to rapamy for a moment do you believe that the primary effect of rapamy is tamping down maladaptive um inflammation through obviously the intermittent blunting of mTor.

[00:57:40] I think that's one of the major things certainly um you know that there's good evidence for enhancement of autophagy. There's good evidence for changes in protein translation and those things are not mutually exclusive to inflammatory changes anyway. Um but I think those are the three things that we have pretty good evidence for. Uh and uh so but I I really think that all of these interventions that we're looking at are restoring dynamic range. They're not. It may take super physiologic changes to to change that linear line, right? But I don't think that's what we're looking at right now. We're restoring things that happened when you were young. So given that we're not likely to have uh human clinical trials of rapamy that study aging for the simple fact that we don't even know what an aging biomarker is. um we're going to largely be extrapolating from animal data if we have to make decisions about humans using rapamy for gir protection.

[00:58:39] All right, I'll I'll push back a little bit and then I know where we're going with this, but we're doing a study like this in in Singapore on humans, six-month intervention with rapamy. Um and we're looking as many different parameters of a we're not doing disease. In fact, we're not taking people with disease.

[00:58:56] We're taking people that are 40 to 60. They may have a precondition for a disease, but they don't have anything that would be defined as a disease. Okay. Um so it could be, you know, high glucose, but not diabet, you know, and and so the um and then we're looking at changes in a wide range of different biomarkers, clocks, which

[00:59:15] So tell me a little bit more about the study. So how many subjects? Um we're doing these I don't remember the exact numbers. It's somewhere around 150 to 200. So it's not huge. And how you're dosing it? Um intermittently. Um once a week, how much? Yeah. Uh I think it's 5 milligrams is what's in the protocol. It's being run by Andrea Meyer, which is one of my collaborators in

[00:59:36] Got it. So 5 milligrams of rapammune once a week for 6 months and then let's go through all the different measurements. Yeah. So a range of clocks, inflammatory cytoine panels, um functional measures, pulsoid velocity, um dexa, um strength measurements, um cognitive measurements, uh and uh I'm still missing a couple of them, but the

[01:00:02] Now, do you expect to see changes in strength or cognition or things like that? I mean, do you do you do you worry that those are kind of the wrong outcomes to look for in a six-month study of people that are young? Yeah. Well, I think that, you know, this comes back to what do you measure? And this is where I knew we were going with this.

[01:00:21] Um, I don't think we know. I mean, certainly you can change those parameters. I think if you exercise, you're going to change change your strength. Absolutely. If this was a six-month exercise trial, fill your boots. I think six-month exercise trial might also change the cognitive parameters. It's possible. Yep.

[01:00:38] So, I think it's a six-month sleep correction trial would undoubtedly change cognitive parameters. Yeah. So, I don't think it's unreasonable that a drug could do these things as well. I think rapamy is complicated when it comes to muscle and I know that partly because I I kind of feel like I'm I'm going to be non-scientific for a minute. I I've become my own best model organism. So, I try all kinds of different things on myself now. I know it's n equals one.

[01:01:05] I'm not sure rapamy and skeletal muscle, you know, without exercise, I'm not sure what it's going to do. I I one of the things I noticed is when I take rapamy, if I do like a hard run, I'm a runner. I've gone to more lifting the last three or four years, but I I've always been a runner. Uh I don't have good runs within 24 hours of taking rapamy. And it may be because you have to activate mTor in a context or something like that.

[01:01:32] Sure. If you take RAPA 24 hours prior to a run, within 24 hours of running. Yeah. Got it. Now, what about if you take RAPA after a run, does your is your recovery better? Do you feel less? I don't have a sense of that. What I do know is if I three or four days after I take RAP, I have really good training.

[01:01:50] So, I I think what's happening is that maybe in that short window after you take it, you can't activate the pathway enough. Uh but in the long term, what you're doing is dampening the basil signaling and you're getting the better dynamic range. So if the trough levels are low, I think but that that's me. But you know, that's just something

[01:02:08] I'm going to experiment with that, Brian, because I always take RAPA the same day of the week. Yeah. And my workouts are always the same. Like I do the same workouts on the same days of the week. I'm going to do a adjustment on that and see. And I don't I didn't try it with resistance either. So I don't know what it's going to do there. So what tools do we have to measure autophagy in humans?

[01:02:32] Well, you can pull out blood cells. Uh we're talking about the limit. I mean we're talking about the limitations of what you can get from a human, right? In blood, saliva. That that's where we're going, I think. And so um you can pull out blood cells and you can look at you know white cells and see, you know, whether autophagy pathways are induced or not. You can take muscle biopsies. We we don't really like doing that uh in our clinical studies because it makes it harder to get volunteers. I I think if you do muscle biopsies the right way, they're probably not that painful to people, but people have that perception and we need healthy volunteers for our studies. Um I would love to look at muscle. Uh I think that, you know, autophagy is another one of these dualged swords though, right? You've got you don't want autophagy on all the time. You want it on at the appropriate levels at the right time and uh if it's on all the time you're going to get muscle atrophy probably. So it's uh again it's about dynamic range.

[01:03:31] What would you need to see in this study to feel that rapamy is girotective because my concern I suppose would be you're not going to see a difference in dexa. You're not going to see a difference in physical performance. You're not going to see a difference in cognitive function. you might see a reduction in certain cytoines but not all cytoines.

[01:03:51] Um I I forget what the other markers that you said were. But my my I guess my concern is we're not able since we can't measure aging, we're not going to see enough of a signal. The other Oh, you mentioned epigenetic clocks. Um in an ideal world, that would be the perfect tool to measure them except for the Chamberlain experiment which I'm sure you're familiar with. But yeah, I I I agree with I I use I I bring Matt to all my conferences now because I use that slide where he did like eight of them at once.

[01:04:23] Yeah. I mean, there are multiple issues here. The one issue is are the consumer testing companies do they have a standardized enough protocol that it's reliable and I think I'm skeptical that that's the case. I I think they're and this is you're doing in-house measurement. You're not using anything. We can control everything. So we get around a lot of those problems just for the listeners so they understand what we're talking about.

[01:04:44] Matt Camberlin bought four of the top commercial tests did them in duplicate simultaneously. So it took eight tests at the same moment in time and he has a funny graph that shows how pathetic they are. Not only do none of the tests agree with each other, the identical tests rarely agree with each other.

[01:05:05] Yeah. So, just if you're listening to this and you want to go out and get a commercial test that tells you how old you are biologically, reconsider it. Okay. I want to tell you we have the potential for a better clock in a minute. So, this let's put a pin. We want to talk about that. Yeah. Um but uh yeah, so consumer-wise, I think there's concerns. Um I think what are you using as a control when you talk about again given how inflammation and epigenetic change might be the only two signals that you find here and again this is just me being pessimistic nanny but this is just my prediction. I I do not think there will be a finding in any of those other measurements but you might have a chance with inflammation and and epigenome if you're false wave too. I just think here's my problem with pulsewave, Brian. It is so user dependent in terms of the technician who is doing like we don't use it clinically at all because we think it's a useless test because like I

[01:06:06] I think the corateed intimal thickening is a useless test and that's an easier test to do because unless you have a tech who basically has a PhD in how to do vascular imaging and they're the only one that does it every minute of every day. If my patients come in with a CINT, I I open a bird cage, I take out the poopy bottom paper, I put their CINT in there, I close the bird cage. That's how useless it is. So So I just worry that all of those tests are not going to they're just going to be noise, no signal. But these other two might have signal.

[01:06:42] So then how do you what's your control for accelerated aging or something else? In other words, it'd be really interesting if you did a six-month parallel fasting trial where if you took people and you rendered them hypoc caloric, you know, you put them on some draconian 60% calorie diet for 6 months where you really think you would tamp down inflammation and autophagy and you pro if anything's going to reprogram the epiggenome in six months, you think that would be it. That would be a very interesting control even if you had a fraction of the number of subjects.

[01:07:14] Yeah. I mean, we're doing multiple. We just The first study we did was with a timereleas version of AKG that with the PDL healthate. Yeah. Um Okay. I'd like to hear more about that. That's finished. And uh we're just analyzing data. So I can't tell you much data, but it we finished the trial. We did six-month intervention and three-month follow-up.

[01:07:32] Um so we want to see if their changes do they maintain if you stop taking the compound. Okay? Because in mice, oddly, they do for aging, but I'm skeptical that's going to happen in humans. So we're so we're doing multiple studies. So So this is sort of like your own at the same time, but there we will be doing the same study over and over and over again with different interventions.

[01:07:54] Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's like I was just saying your ITP equivalent in humans. Yeah. Um and by the way, I don't know if 6 months is long enough. I don't know if we're doing the right tests. I don't think anybody knows these answers. What is the cost of doing that experiment you just described? Uh it's about million and a half sync.

[01:08:09] So that's a million to million and a half US dollars. Yeah. This is really interesting and and not that I'm here to do this, but it's just I get asked so much by people where can I put money? Where can I put money? So I I'd like to make sure that people who are listening to this who are thinking about, hey, how do I fund insanely highlevered research?

[01:08:30] This to me strikes a great way to be funding, right? We would love to have that because it's really hard to raise money for this still. Yeah. But if you think about it, if you're if you're sitting there and you're listening to this and you're saying, "Look, I'd like to put a million dollars to work on something that would dramatically change, you know, adding a decade to life, you're way better off putting, in my opinion, you really are better off putting money into this type of translational research than you are into basic science or into, you know, pharma research that is tends to be a little bit more, you know, you're just you're not going to move.

[01:09:01] Is still not doing aging. I mean, it's I, you know, they're thinking about it. They're starting to, but they've been saying that for a long time. No, this is this is great. Um, because you can tell I have strong opinions on ideas for how to do some of these experiments. So, let's talk a little bit about alpha ketoglutarate and why walk us through the rationale for how that came to be something that you would put through this type of rigorous program.

[01:09:25] Yeah. So, uh company full disclosure that I'm involved with uh PDL Health uh they have a product rejuvenant now. They came to us many years ago at the Buck and working with Gordon Lithkco and I and they were like let's screen natural products uh that would have an impact on aging because you know their the mindset of um the CEO of this what became the

[01:09:45] CEO of this company was that I I I can't get drugs approved for aging at any time in the near future. Let's work with natural products and also so things that the FDA just calls grass out of the gate. And let's let's look for combinations of things that work together. um because we can get IP around combinations, we can't get IP around single natural products.

[01:10:07] Um so we screened a lot of things in worms and AKG came out as one of the best things in worms and then we started testing interventions in mice and that's led now to we're testing like we do four or five different intervention studies in mice every six months now. um not just with natural products and not just for this company but we built that into our own kind of ITP in mice too although we do it differently but anyway AK AKG came out as one of the biggest effects and then in the mouse studies we found that for male mice there was a combined effect with uh vitamin A and uh vitamins are an interesting discussion too uh and there was also a combined effect with both sexes with vitamin D and so that led to this product rejuvenate which is

[01:10:53] AKG timereleas AKG very important because otherwise it it's like in it goes away in 5 minutes if you don't have a time release version tell tell folks what alpha ketoglutarate is it shows it's a part of the is it part of the KB cycle it's yeah it is it's a the TCA cycle and KB cycle central metabolite involved in hundreds of reactions it's a lot like

[01:11:12] NAD and they're doing different things but they're both central metabolites they're both going down with aging in organisms y and the idea is supplementing them back up would be beneficial. Um, and so when we did that with AKG in mice, we see about a 5 to 10% increase in lifespan, but a dramatic increase in frailty. So when we Yeah, I know what you mean.

[01:11:35] Yeah. So that mice, I would argue that you're extending squaring the longevity curve as we talk about it. Yeah. So um, you know, if we could if that translated to humans, it would be a big impact. And so that's what led to the human product. By the way, I think that if you did not extend lifespan by a day

[01:11:51] Yeah. but you just improved health span. Yeah, that's a home run. Yeah, I agree. I for most people that is all they actually want. Yeah, I I agree. I think if they get that, they'll want the other two. But that's But yeah, I I But never the reverse. No, nobody wants more lifespan. That's what we're doing now.

[01:12:11] I know. I know. I That's That's called medicine 2.0. Um but yeah, I I completely agree with that. So, you know, we're still excited about this product. There's been about AKG and especially the time release version. And there's been um you know, some some studies that have been published, one of which we helped analyze the data for using rudimentary methylation clocks showing that they reverse that that it reverses aging by a few years. Again, it's that oscillation thing we were talking about earlier, I think. Um, and that's why we wanted to do a controlled placebo double-blinded clinical trial at the university. In that case, we're just testing the time release AKG. We didn't include the vitamins because we're trying to get some mechanistic information. We don't want confounders in there. Um, but I'm I think as the data is still pretty pretty good on AKG that it's going to have an impact in people.

[01:13:07] Um, so that human trial has been completed. You're evaluating the data. you're going to have to see a signal. But are you in each of these trials, do you do the same measurements, the the same uh outcomes? Generally, yes. But we we sometimes modify the primary endpoint um because we want to choose a primary endpoint that's most likely impacted by the intervention. In a way, it doesn't matter that much because we're measuring as many things as possible anyway. Um and uh of course, we learn over time as we do things. So, we add things or take things out that are not working well, that sort of thing. So did you guys do a study on urylthna as well?

[01:13:44] We haven't published it yet, but I am happy to talk a little bit about it. We don't have human data, but the mouse data is really good on uralithna. I I'm a believer it worked in our hands. The first this is why we haven't published yet because when we did it, it dramatically reduced frailty in male mice, but not females. And so we're repeating that because I I there may be sex specific differences, but we were the first ones to see that. So we want to go back and see what's going on. Now,

[01:14:09] I feel like I've I feel like I've written a newsletter on this where I came down on the side of this isn't doing anything. Um, is am I mistaking this for a different molecule? Is this the one that in theory enhances mitochondrial function? Is that the the enhances mphagy? So, turnover of damaged mitochondria. I'm not sure I completely agree with that. We do see that in cell culture, but we also see mitochondrial biogenesis. And so these two things are connected, right? If you induce mitochondrial biogenesis, you'll also induce mphagy. And so it's kind of I'm not sure whe who's where's the chicken and where's the egg in this, but it does seem to uh induce mitochondrial turnover. But we also find other pathways. We've done we when we look at a molecule, if we don't know enough about it, we like rapamy, we know it binds to mtor uriththin, we don't know what it does. And AKG also, we know a lot of things it can do. We don't know which ones are relevant for aging. uh for uriththin we went back and did this screening assay to proteomics thermal shift assay that to look for binding partners for the compound and we have some so how tell me about the history that led to using it well for us I mean uh Johan Oware published this uh data that it was slowing aging in mice and that's uh led to a lot of research so we weren't the first ones to study urolithin uh and a lot of what we do is testing interventions that come from other labs because If I'm gonna do a human study, I want to at least see it repeat in my hands in an animal first.

[01:15:42] Absolutely. If it doesn't repeat in my hands, that doesn't mean it doesn't work. It may mean the conditions are different, but I think it does if it does repeat, it makes an argument for robustness. Um, and so that's why we started uriththan. We've we also see positive effects of spermadine and glycine and other things.

[01:15:59] Um but um yeah so uh we we didn't make the initial discovery on urolithin but you know so we don't know the mechanism of action. Well they would argue it's increase mitochondrial turnover but we have but we don't have a target. We have targets we haven't published yet. Oh you do? Okay. Yeah. Are did you guys discover the target?

[01:16:18] Yeah we we've got a couple new targets that we haven't published yet. So that could explain some of the effects. And have you studied this in humans yet? No not yet. that's planned but hasn't been done yet. This might be actually one of the ones where I would say unlike in the rapid trial, you actually want to come up with primary outcomes that are quite different here. This is where uh for example, I'd want to see fat oxidation.

[01:16:42] Yeah. I'd want to see, you know, what we talk about is zone 2 efficiency. I mean, if this is indeed improving mitochondrial function, I I'm not aware of a better test of mitochondrial function. No, I agree with you. And and I and that raises the point of whether we should couple these interventions to exercise.

[01:16:58] Uh and those ones that one for sure complication, but it may be worth doing in this context. And not to get in your business, you must muscle biopsy these people. Yeah, I know. You're going to have to get athlete. You're going to have to get people that are willing to to get, you know, to get a little punch biopsy of the quads because it's just it's too important to understand what's happening. I think a lot of these supplements I'm going to go back to an N equals one story here. Yeah. I think a lot of these supplements are impacting exercise. And so it's kind of a a win-win. You you you take something, you exercise better, you drive benefits from that exercise. So it's kind of you win twice with some of these. And I'll tell you what happened recently. I've been very skeptical of NAD. Uh not that going down and restoring it won't be good, but

[01:17:46] I'm skeptical it's going through certuins. I think it could be doing a lot of other things. Uh, but I'm also skeptical that NRN are really changing NAD levels that much and our mice don't really respond in our studies with NRN. I've never noticed anything taking NR. Again, that's just one person, but that's me.

[01:18:04] And and when I last looked at this, and I know I'm going to get a lot of hate mail because I always get hate mail when I talk about this. The only study I've seen in humans that shows a real benefit of NR was in patients with ALS that had the the patients in the NR group had a a longer time before requiring ventilation than the patients on the placebo. Is there another study I'm missing?

[01:18:32] Well, there have been health span studies arguing improved health span, but but by what metric? Yeah, I don't I can tell you we've done them as well and and we do see very subtle changes within our and that that are aspects of the frailty measurements we in mice or in humans in mice, but it's not enough to really convince us it's statistically significant. So, I'm I wouldn't be shocked if there's a tiny effect is what

[01:18:56] I'm saying. But um and why do you think that is? Do you think it's that NR and NMN are not efficient vehicles to generate enough NA? That's one thing for sure. But well, let me tell you the rest of the story because I've pretty much given up on the pathway and a company that um came to me and wanted to test one of their products and it this company is called EX BioParma. Anyway, they have a new product that's sublingual NAD. So they they don't they they specialize in technology for sublingual delivery and they make other things too. Uh so we'll just explain to folks why that matters. You can't take NAD orally because it just gets destroyed. So typically people take NAD intravenously.

[01:19:39] But if you take something under the tongue, you get this magical property where it dissolves and it enters the circulation without passing through the digestion and obviously the liver where these things get chewed up and you can do this every day, right? IV I mean lots of lots of drugs are given in this manner, right, Kevin?

[01:19:57] Yeah. IV is just not practical on a on a compet repetitive basis. How many milligrams of NAD are they 100 milligrams and the one I'm taking also has epigenine in it which is a CD38 inhibitor. So CD38 is a consumer of NAD. Uh so if you block that enzyme, this is another natural product. If you block that enzyme then you also effectively increase NAD.

[01:20:22] Okay. And so I was taking that along with the rejuvenant which is the AKG plus vitamin A and also it is B complex but mainly AKG effect. And when I take them together I notice this acute effect on my exercise performance. So I'm running my heart rate goes up my respiratory rate doesn't go up as much.

[01:20:41] It goes up a little bit but normally if my heart rate's at 150 or 155 I'm breathing hard. I'm breathing closer to normally when I take these two things together. I've gone off. I've gone back on. I've taken one off. Is your rate of perceived exertion tracking more with your respiratory rate or your heart rate?

[01:20:59] It's tracking more with my respiratory rate. I don't perceive that I'm exerting. I run faster when I do it. You know what would be so cool to see, Brian, is measuring your lactate levels at a fixed heart rate under those two different respiratory rates, but under the same load. So, same do it on a treadmill just to make it unambiguous.

[01:21:17] Uh, I'd be super curious to see a lactate performance curve. I should do that. Yeah, I I I this I don't think you can imagine this, you know, I've got, you know, things telling me these two parameters, right? So, um it's really I'd like to just quit my job and do nothing other than these experiments.

[01:21:37] Yeah. And like I said, this may happen for no one else. I don't know. But for me, it I can go off. It it sort of goes away. It's starting to not go away now because I've been it's improving my exercise performance and now I'm getting more fit. So, it's getting harder to see the effect, but uh it still comes and goes when I go on and off either the AKG or the

[01:21:57] The other thing I'd be interested to see is um let's pretend off drug heart rate 150, RP7, velocity X. Yeah. On drug, I want you to go back to the same RP. uh um let heart rate go higher and let velocity go higher and I'm curious as to how long you can sustain that relative to what you were doing before. In other words, like does some other system get in the way that ultimately reduces your capacity?

[01:22:30] I I can't answer but the first the reason I noticed is that I the I'd taken it three days. I I didn't even think about it. You know, it's like every morning I do it that I was on the treadmill and I'm running, you know, and I'm I'm running I keep pushing the speed up and I'm not getting out of breath. And I was going to run 5K. I ran 12K.

[01:22:54] Uh and I still didn't feel that tired at the end of it. Um and then I started thinking, how did this happen? Cuz I know how my body performs normally. So this are you is this is this molecule in trials yet with humans? It's not even have to be in trials. It's a natural product. So, it's No, but I mean, it's on It's on the market.

[01:23:12] Yes. Yes. Yes. But if if for those of us who want to actually know if it works Oh, come on. Those of us who believe in this pesky thing called evidence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting past that now. I'm joking. I There have been a lot of animal studies and they can show that when they I'm not even sure this is published. I think I can say this. when they add uh sublingually in a rat model, you have to anesthetize the rats to get the sublingual delivery. Yeah.

[01:23:38] Uh that uh you see it incorporated very highly in red blood cells, the NAD. This was just with the NAD, not epigen. Um and so the the argument there is literature to support this and it's not my field, but I'll just say what it is, is that they're channels that can take up NAD directly in certain cell types. Uh there is literature out there for that. I had

[01:24:00] Josh Rabinowitz on the podcast and he talked at length about this. Um, and yeah, I mean what I took away from that discussion was intravenous NAD will work. Yeah. Um, the question is what's it working for? And so would your belief be that the effect you experience here should be mirrored by what somebody experiences with introvenous NAD notwithstanding the limitations of the frequency that they could do it?

[01:24:26] Yes, I think so. But the dose is so much higher on IV and AD. It could be too high. I don't know. But the in theory, yes. And uh but this is so simple. You just every morning it's gone in 30 seconds. And so I I think that I you know and and for me again it's enhanced by the AKG too. So it's you're adding two metabolites that are both going down with aging that are both involved in hundreds of different they're giving you cellular metabolic flexibility. I think that's what they're doing. I don't think it's one pathway they're activating.

[01:24:57] And is the alpha ketoglutarate with vit it's vitamin E or A that it's combined for a male it's vitamin A and the new product has some B complex in it as well. And these are commercially available products. Yeah. And and you're about to publish on them in humans. The rejuvenant has already been published on the AKG by itself. Yeah. An uncontrolled uh not placeboc controlled methylation study that of users. Okay. So take what you want out of that. Uh we're not not much. I'm just gonna say well I you can you can take you can talk me off my my

[01:25:29] No no no no I don't want to try to but I will say that I think community day is valuable and I think if if you go back and look at the paper uh we didn't do the any of the analysis we just analyzed the data but if you go back and look at the paper I think we were very clear in that paper even in the abstract of the limitations of the finding. So, I think that for community- based data, it's better to have it out there and published, but you have you want authors that are willing to be honest about what the data says and what the data doesn't say. Um, but yeah, the the study that's been completed is just AKG time release, so none of the vitamins uh and it's placeboc controlled and as many parameters as we can measure. So, hopefully it'll show something.

[01:26:10] Okay. And then you're doing the one with vitamin A and E. No, we we don't we're not doing that right now. We'd love to do that, but um we we financed this study ourselves. Uh the only thing the company did was supply the time release AKG. Um and and so it would be good to go back and look at the actual product and in combined with this NAD now, but the I just sort of figured that out myself 5 months ago. I don't even have any animal data that that's true. It would be interesting to go back and add these things in animals, but you can, you know, you can anesthetize a rat and do sublingual delivery one time and measure the PKPD, but yeah, but you can't do performance time.

[01:26:49] It's going to be a nightmare. Um, you mentioned spermadine a moment ago. Let's talk about that. It's getting quite a bit of buzz. Um, tell us tell us everything about spermadine. Well, so uh we studied that a while ago when I was at the Buck and uh we wanted to look at we were confused because at that time the data was spermadine could extend lifespan but it didn't impact metabolism and I'm like almost everything in a mouse that extends lifespan has some impact on metabolism. So we did a highfat study with spermadine and and we we showed that in old animals spermadine could suppress the metabolic uh dysfunction that came from highfat diet in mice. But we had some control mice too and actually not many but the because the design the study wasn't designed to do lifespan but we left them alive and looked at survival and the spermadine extended the lifespan of the mice too.

[01:27:40] Has spermadine been studied in the ITP? I don't think it has it. Don't think it has. Don't quote me but I don't think it has. Um, and so we we were able to repeat the lifespan effect in mice even though that wasn't the goal of our study and and show that it restores metabolism in a in a calorie challenged context. Um, and so that's what made me believe that, you know, we it's a robust molecule that we can see that effect as well. So I I I would say I'm optimistic about spermadine as well that we haven't done a lot.

[01:28:13] Where does spermadine occur in nature? you're um I actually don't remember the answer, but it's naturally occurring. It I it does naturally occur. Yes. Yes. Yes. So there's no uh I think it's in certain certain foods or have it, but I'm I'm worried I'm conflating that with the uralithn. So Okay. Have you guys looked at alpha estradiol 17?

[01:28:39] No, we haven't looked at that. Um I I I would be an interesting one. I agree. And I I'm also run director of an Asian center for reproductive longevity and equality in in in US and Singapore where we're looking at ovarian aging. Mhm. And there's two things I've it's made me this is like, you know, it's like PhD biologist, you know, all of a sudden I'm getting asked a million questions about

[01:29:05] HRT. So I decided I better learn something. Um, but there's two things that I've learned from this. One is that ger protectors tend to extend fertility in mice. And it's not just one thing. It's spermadine. It's AKG. It's been shown for metformin and rapamy. And in there's a rapid trial going on I think.

[01:29:24] Yeah. And uh so that's one really potentially uh useful avenue of translation for these ger protectors and I'm really excited about that. The other thing I think and maybe you're you have more expertise than I do so you're please disagree is that the question should not be should a woman do HRT. The question should be is there any reason a woman should not do HRT because I just see the the value of of hormone replacement to far outweigh the risk in the majority of women. I don't know if you feel that way, but it's something that

[01:29:59] And so 17 alpha is interesting, right? Because it worked in males and not females. Yeah. It's also non-feminizing. I don't know what that really means, but I I mean I not sure how much I believe that, but you know, and so it could be triggering some of these same pathways. And um and I know you know that you know testosterone is another one that you know the NI did the study on it and show it's a little bit of an increased risk in prostate cancer and then everybody said don't do testosterone replacement. Uh, and I I I think that although that's been fully fully debunked.

[01:30:34] I agree. And then so most men are not doing that or if they're doing it, they're doing it in uncontrolled ways that and taking levels maybe to too high that could be dangerous. And so I feel like that there's a lot I feel like men are in a better position today because one more trials have been done to undo the bad ones. So, the

[01:30:55] Traverse trial, which was published, it's probably been a year now, but that sort of undid a lot of the even though it was the Traverse had many problems with it, but it undid a lot of the damage of some of the fear-mongering from really bad studies that suggested testosterone was causing prostate cancer. Turns out it's the exact opposite. But women, unfortunately, are still struggling under the dark cloud of the

[01:31:15] Women's Health Initiative, which was, you know, apocryphal. And I I mean, it just, you know, no one's undone it. And I I travel to 25 countries a year and a lot of countries in Southeast Asia. And so now everywhere I go, if I see a doctor, I'm like, how many women are doing HRT? And what are you finding?

[01:31:31] Extremely low. Like and because they're differential to US recommendations or I think the changes and the the what doctors tell people is is slower in in these countries, but maybe there's less risk. It's also costs money, right? So there if you have somebody that doesn't have a lot of access to finances, they may be less able to do it in these countries. I don't know all the reasons, but I'm just I'm I'm I'm just looking into it now, but it's stunning how how low the HRT is around the world still.

[01:32:06] And and and we're just missing an easy opportunity there, I think, to help people. I I agree. I mean, I think um there's a part of me that is just so interested in the frontier and like how do you push the boundaries of this stuff? How, you know, I I truly could be infinitely happy working nowhere but at the frontiers of thinking about the molecules.

[01:32:31] But at the same time, I feel just as excited about trying to figure out how to make sure people aren't scoring own goals all day. Yeah. Right. Like there's so many ways to just help a person without anything magical, find another 5 years of life and dramatically improve health span through judicious use of everything from HRT to correct exercise, reasonable nutrition. Like there's just so many great ways to do it. But obviously the idea of doing both of these is so appealing.

[01:33:05] I come back every 3 months to the US. you know, I lived here 50 years and then I left and I come back every 3 months and the same two things, you know, you leave someplace, you come back, you notice things you didn't notice, right? And and the same two things every time I come back or the I get it in the airport. I don't even have to like leave the airport. One is so many people are not in health. They're not in shape.

[01:33:26] There's so much obesity, you know, it it's just it's striking compared to almost anywhere else in the world. Um the second one is people just seem so stressed here. It's I don't get that. I Singapore is a pretty stressed country and I still feel that people are more stressed here when I come back. What are the obesity rates in Singapore?

[01:33:44] Uh relatively low, but in Asia, you've got this challenge with skinny diabetes, right? And so you have a lot of uh people that can't build the atyposity that they need, right? But they're storing all the visceral fat. So they're storing the fat the wrong places and it's maybe even worse than so the diet is is moving more western in

[01:34:02] Asia and it's creating problems. it's just not as obesity associated. So, and now that you're coming back, do you notice a difference at all based on SGLT2 inhibitors? Uh, pardon me, um, GLP-1 agonists. I I think they're making a difference, but I I guess, you know, I'm just It's not passing the airport test.

[01:34:19] Not passing the airport test yet. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how widespread they're being used either. This you probably know that. You know, I don't think I'm familiar with the latest stats on on on how widely they're being used. Let's let's chat. Let's go back to kind of the epigenetic clock situation. So,

[01:34:34] Do you think that there could be value in this as a tool? Right. And and let me hold the bar as high as I think it would need to be to justify their use. So right now we have this thing called chronologic age. Um I can look at your birth certificate. I can know how old you are and based on that I can make an estimate of how much longer you will live. Mhm.

[01:34:57] So if I look at a person who's 40 years old and I know nothing else about them and then I see another person who is 65 years old and I know nothing else about them, I can say with a high degree of confidence that the 65year-old person will live, you know, I'm making this up because I'm not an actuary, but somewhere between 20 and 30 more years and the 40year-old person I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence will live, you know, whatever somewhere between uh call it you know 30 to 50 more years or something like that.

[01:35:32] Um now to me that's a pretty good test. Mhm. Right. I know I know I know a I know a knowable measurable thing about them. Um it's measurable by knowing their birth date. Right. Um and it predicts future life. Mhm. So, do you think biologic clocks will ever serve a purpose like that where I could um take two 50 year olds and one of them has a biologic age of 40 and one of them has a biologic age of 60 according to the clock and that those numbers will actually be better at predicting future life than their chronologic age of 50? Or do you put yourself in the camp that says, "No,

[01:36:17] Peter, that's a ridiculous standard that no biologic clock could ever come to." But it might tell me about their health. It might be yet another biomarker that says, "Hey, the guy at 40 is just healthier than the guy at 60." And somehow, by the way, it's picking that signal out of a data field that I can't pick out anywhere else because they otherwise look identical. We measured this recently uh because we uh uh collaborators of mine at In US uh uh Yan

[01:36:48] Gruber and Fun uh and I had this small role in this project. Um they decided Fun's a geriatrician. He sees people all the time uh frustrated you know what can the geriatricians have limited things they can do. they're seeing people that are already have multimorbidity and you know and he you know the clocks are not that useful and so he wanted to like how do we create a reliable clock that a doctor can understand and so we for what purpose for um biologic age I I'll tell you what

[01:37:20] I think the purpose is for it in a minute okay um and this build so they're first generation and second generation clocks the first generation clocks try to predict your chronologic age and the second ones predict some outcome So the question is we want to predict mortality. We don't want to predict your chronologic age.

[01:37:36] Yep. So intrinsically if it works it's going to do better than the than chronologic age for the second generation clocks. Um so we took in hannes you know data collected around 1999 2000 mortality data for 200 months and we just and and these parameters are nice and because you can actually do a consumer test of HBA1C you know there are many labs that do that. It's reproducible to a large extent much better than DNA methylation and doctors use all these parameters. So the things that are in inhanes like LDL you know all the things in your book inflammatory markers you know uh medical test uh you know some some cognitive self-reported stuff so we took everything as a feature and used AI uh linear model to try to predict mortality. Um and uh they're on we're on the second generation of this clock now.

[01:38:32] Uh and it predicts mortality better than any other parameter in inhanes. It's way better than ASCVD. Uh there's cardiovascular disease measurement. Um and so recently the methylation data came out on inhanes and so we could go back and compare the mortality prediction for methylation clocks. Some of the first generation clocks are worse than chronologic age.

[01:38:56] Your passport is better than they are at predicting mortality, which to me means that they're not useful because, you know, even if they're not designed to predict mortality, if they don't capture some element of that, what are they measuring? You know, the second generation clocks like grim age and pheno age, they do better job than chronologic age for sure at predicting mortality.

[01:39:18] Mortality. Yeah. And just to be clear, we've captured that out of the NHANES database. That's from Inhanes. That's the only thing we've looked at right now. Okay. Let me make sure I understand that by def you had 200 months Yeah. of forward-looking data. So anyway, you've got um uh 18 years of data and um you're saying we if we know the methylation of somebody at that time in the cohort 1999 to 2000 um we could predict their date of death better than the actuarial data of their age. Yeah.

[01:39:53] Okay. I wasn't aware of that. Well, it's just I'm not I don't think it's even it's been accepted for publication. I'm not even sure it's online yet. So Okay. Um it's not your fault. That's very interesting. Okay. Yeah. That because that so that basically answers a question that I've never seen answered.

[01:40:07] Yeah. But our clinical chemistry clock does better than that those. Okay. And and what is included in that clinical clock? Well, there are about 50 parameters that we measure now. But see, complete blood count gives you about 30 of those parameters. So it's not as elaborate as you think it would be. Yeah. Yeah. No, I believe.

[01:40:23] Um and then you know it's a lot of standard markers that you already measure. You probably measure all I guess that was going to be my question is it's about $300 in Singapore if you did it all denovo but anybody going to a doctor's office has most of those parameters measured anyway and if they're going to you know a wellness longevity center all of them are probably of course yeah and so the the question I suppose is this if you're met life you already like you are better at predicting mortality than anybody on the planet and I don't know if it's at life, by the way, but like pick the best life insurance company.

[01:41:00] Yeah. Like this is their business. They're so good at predicting mortality, it's frightening. And so, yeah, I I don't know how they're doing that, so I can't comment. And nobody does, right? But my point is they're looking at age. They're looking at a whole bunch of things in your medical history. They're looking at a whole bunch of blood tests, your blood pressure, your weight, your waist, your circumference, all those things. and they're coming up with an exceptional prediction of remaining years on life.

[01:41:26] The real question is do you believe that they will incorporate a second generation uh epigenetic clock or do you believe that they've already got that captured in their data set? They may I don't know it's an unanswerable question but again I we're focusing on the clinical chemistry anyway. We're not doing any methylation.

[01:41:43] Y so um and what we're finding is hospitals want to use this now clinical chemistry or methylation clinical chemistry and I I think it's because it resonates you know when you when you show them the list of parameters a doctor doesn't have to be an expert in epigenetics to to figure out what's going on and the other thing is they're all actionable so we have principal components that we can break it down in and we can see smoking in one component and we can see metabolic disease in another one and obesity in another one and we find cases is we find a few conclusions from this are really interesting. One is we find cases where nothing's out of the reference range.

[01:42:19] Okay. So a doctor that's looking at things especially if they have a few minutes to look at they're not going to prescribe anything for this person. Yeah. But these four parameters in this principal component are increasing you know their their biologic age by four years which means it's increasing their uh it's 50% increase in mortality risk.

[01:42:40] So that's these are actionable things. You know, you can treat LDL, you can treat high blood pressure, you can treat these markers, right? And so clinicians are actually willing to then be a little bit more aggressive and try to prescribe something or lifestyle modification or something to treat these markers.

[01:42:58] So it's actionable. So yeah, exactly. That that makes sense. The reason that you prefer this is it it doesn't just give you an answer, it gives you a solution. Yeah. That that's what we're working toward. And and so we're the other thing we we did is we broke in Hannes down really interesting. So you can inhesane also has all the medications people are taking. But the the weakness of it is a snapshot. It's a cross-sectional measurement of all these things. But they measured a lot of stuff. And so we could look at what are people's clinical parameters out of the reference range. Should they be being prescribed some drug and they're not being given it? And that goes up to about 20%. and and when you're 65 years old than year 2000 in the US meaning 25% of people should be giving treated for something but they're not being treated those people have a higher biologic age and faster mortality not surprising there's also the group that has everything every at 65 every clinical parameter looks good and they have a lower biologic age they live longer but you can break that group down and you can say one group is not taking any medication and the other group is taking medication. It's just their clinical parameters are managed well. The people taking the medication have a lower biologic age and live longer.

[01:44:15] And it doesn't really matter what the medication is. You know, it's true for the major medications you would get for metabolic and cardiovascular disease in the year 2000. So, I think that suggests that being more aggressive uh and getting people optimized earlier is better than just being, oh, I'm pretty healthy and my blood pressure is a little bit high, but I don't need to take, you know, and so it's suggesting we need to be more aggressive. I think the other thing is that suggesting that these drugs that were around in 2000 for these treating preconditions are actually aging drugs. They're they're they're actually and what are the classes that we see the most common lipid and hypertension hypertension metab metformin and it's a standard things and so so do you think metformin will have um geroprotective properties in people who are metabolically healthy skeptical but I think what it is saying is that if you catch preconditions early enough you keep you you protect against the other failure states a a little bit too. So it it's uh

[01:45:22] So you're more optimistic that rapamy would be geroprotective in humans than metformin? Yeah, that would be my prediction. Yeah. Do you think there is a drug out there that you think is more um likely to be gerrotective in humans than rapamy at this time? Well, the the GLP um drugs uh and SGLT2 I think are interesting. I don't think we have the data right now, but it's definitely again I don't know in people that are

[01:45:50] You know, if you're obese, I need Yeah. Okay. So, let let me restate the question. If if we if we just took a population of middle-aged healthy individuals and we we could design an experiment where you had the placebo arm, the metformin arm, the rapamy arm, the SGLT2 inhibitor arm, and the GLP1 agonist arm.

[01:46:12] What is your prediction in length of life or additional years of life given in that six arm study or whatever it is? I I think the the the last three would be comparable. Metformin I'm skeptical of. So RAPA, SGLT2, GLP1. Yeah. I I just I we don't have data in healthy people that much with SGLT2 and and GLP1. I mean, so mechanism of action is what? If these, if the if the GLP-1 group and the

[01:46:40] SGLT2 group are metabolically healthy, they don't have glucose excursions that are high, they're, you know, they're insulin. What is, what do you believe is the mechanism of action? I guess, you know, if it I think I I guess I'm going by a different statement, which is most people we're calling healthy are not totally metabolically healthy.

[01:46:56] Sure. Uh, and so in those cases, I think there would be a benefit. But then I guess I don't know in the perfectly optimized person whether there'd be a benefit. And I I every time I talk to a doctor, I ask them, are you losing more lean muscle mass with these drugs than you are just by fasting or or or lifestyle? And I get if I ask 10 doctors, I get 10 answers.

[01:47:16] So I don't know what the I don't know what the answer to that question is. But I think the reason that at least as a thought experiment it's an interesting question is because if the GLP-1 agonist and SGLT2 inhibitors only work if you have some degree yeah of um glucose irregularity. Yeah. Then it begs the question well it says look glucose homeostasis is one of the most important features of living.

[01:47:46] Great. Um, but if you could correct that with diet, sleep, and exercise, which you can, yeah, I agree it can. Um, it's hard, but it could be done. Yeah. Uh, then those things aren't going after fundamental pillars of aging because people who eat well, who exercise well, and sleep well still age. Yeah. It's it's going it's answering, you know, Matt and I debate this all the time about, you know, and we did a we published a study in mice recently where we analyzed all the data that's out there in mice and um and we tried to determine, you know, how where's reality on interventions that extend lifespan in mice because if the shortlived if the control mice are really short-lived, which happens a lot a lot. Why is that?

[01:48:34] It's just really hard to control. I mean, if you look at the ITP data, the control mice are all over the board, and they're very well controlled. The best scientists doing the experiment, we see a lot of variation, too. I I just think it's there are some cases they're bad vivariums, and that make causes a problem. But even in good vivariums,

[01:48:54] I don't know. It's true in every organism, in yeast, and worms. One cohort of worms will all live a little bit shorter. One cohort of worms will live a little bit longer. It's cohort dependent, but I don't know why. Uh, but anyway, if the if the mice are short-lived, if your extension is there, all you can say is it's longevity normalizing.

[01:49:16] Uh, you don't know that it's slowing aging. It's only when the controls are really longived and you're getting extension that you can really make the argument it's longevity extending. And so, that gets to your question. The real answer though is dependent on how many people you believe that are optimized right now because it's impossible to do the study.

[01:49:35] Yeah. No, no, of course it it longevity normalizing works in this population. Trust me, at least for health for for keeping people healthy, but whether it's really slowing aging is a is a open question. I think I think the best case would be rapamy in there. Yeah. And and then of course it begs the question which is could these effects be additive?

[01:49:54] Right. So, so would there be a benefit to a person who is on balance quite healthy? But let's say their average gl let's say their hemoglobin A1C if it is indeed an accurate representation of their average glucose is 5.4%. So I don't know exactly what that translates to. It probably translates to an average blood glucose of 110 or so milligrams per deciliter.

[01:50:18] But the data there there are data that show based on hemoglobin A1C that lower is always better. So 5.0 is better than 5.4 even though 5.4 is deemed completely healthy. And that's AC that's all cause mortality data. So um we're saying we take a person who's at 5.4. They're not even pre-diabetic. They can't even they can barely see where pre-diabetic starts.

[01:50:41] Um let alone diabetic. But we give them an SGLT2 inhibitor. They come I'm at 5.4. Can I I can volunteer for this. There you go. So you go from 5.4 four down to 5.1 just on the basis of that drug. We throw a GLP1 agonist on top of that. Now you're at 4.9. Um then we give you rapamy which really doesn't impact your glucose but we think it's going to do something a little bit different. Um you would say in that situation you might believe that there's some actual protection but not adding metformin.

[01:51:12] I don't want to lose muscle mass though. And which of those drugs would you be most afraid of? The GLP1 agonist or wrap-up? GLP1 agonist. Okay. I I think lean muscle mass is like super important. It's probably better to have high lean muscle mass and be a little bit more fat than it is to be low on both is my best guess. Now, what do you make of the data that I talk about all the time, which look at the hazard ratios for mortality based on high V2 max and high muscle mass and high strength and how those three things stand out so far above anything else. Um meaning like when you look at hazard ratios associated with smoking, type two diabetes, even cancer. Yeah.

[01:51:58] Um they are not as lethal as being incredibly weak, incredibly low in muscle mass and incredibly low in fitness. And do you how much causality do you think is there versus how much of that is just those are just such good markers of health? I think there's causality there. I think it's super important, but it may only be important for squaring the curve. I don't think there's much evidence that maximum lifespan is extended by these things. And we don't have the human data. Of course, the animal data, you can't do the experiment.

[01:52:28] The animal data pretty much with exercise says you square the curve. Again, that's I agree with you. It's a revolution if we can do that. I'm not I'm not being negative about it. But I don't know about maximum lifespan whether there be an effect or not. But I believe it so much that I put a lot of effort in increasing my lean mass, you know, and and so I that's why I started resistance training because I wasn't getting as much from running. I get I get more mindfulness from running.

[01:52:54] Yeah. You know, I I get uh but I did a lot more resistance training, too. So, yeah, I I I typically will tell patients that you should really think of exercise. Yeah, I I do actually think it's it's reducing your risk of chronic disease. Um, but then you still get into the whack-a-ole game. If it lowers your risk of Alzheimer's disease, it might not have much of an impact on cancer risk.

[01:53:17] It's unclear. But, um, if it didn't, if it lowered your life expectancy by 6 months, it would still be worth it based on the health span benefits that you get and the quality of life that you would enjoy, especially in that final decade of life. Probably. Let me come back to one point though because I'm I'm a bit of a rant about this. combining interventions.

[01:53:38] You know, first of all, I will say two things before I say what I'm going to say. One is that I believe we need to empower people to make decisions on their own health. And so, I support hackers if they want to, you know, educate themselves and try different things and they know what the benefits and risks might be and what we know and we don't know. More power to them. I feel like part of the reasons we get such low compliance in medications is that we don't empower people. We don't give them choices. They don't know why they're doing things. We just tell them what to do and people don't respond well to that. So, having said that, I can't pick three interventions that work well together and in a mouse, you know, and we do these studies all the time. The thing they're more likely to cancel each other out than to have additive effects.

[01:54:25] And so, if you're mixing 20 colors of or taking 20 pills, it's like mixing 20 colors of paint together. You're going to get some ugly gray outcome. or at best you're gonna get an unknown outcome that we can't predict. So I'm I'm really cautious and want to tell people that, you know, there are a lot of people out there promoting doing a million different things at the same time. I try one or two things at the same time. And

[01:54:49] I I try to see how my body responds. I measure things. Measure even simple measures are useful. Uh, and I think that um, if you're doing 10 things, you don't have any idea what's working and what's not working and whether things might be impairing each other. And I really think that's a scary path to go down. Now, what about, for example, how are you deciding to use the alpha ketoglutarate and the NAD if I mean because you've you've seen at least some evidence that each of those individually works. I I've been using the the the rejuvenant with the AKG for a long time because I I was involved in the research, you know, I'm on I'm actually on the board of the company.

[01:55:29] I I I it's something I've done and I've just taken for years and I add one thing to it and take it away. So I've tried aanthin, I've tried fukcoidin, I've tried rapamy, I've tried a bunch of other things, too. So and I try to measure before and after. I've got I'm getting better at that. when I first started doing it wasn't measuring that much, but uh and so that that's the approach I take. Um but I I never take like six things at one time and and and it's kind of intuitive. If something's interesting to me, you see an effect on the mice, I want to try it. So like I want to do urolithin and aazanthin next.

[01:56:06] And if you had significantly more resources, right? So let's say you had um a budget that is what is your current budget this year for both animal and human research? Uh it's complicated because we have multiple streams. I would say we probably spend about four million a year total. So if that number were multiplied by 10

[01:56:26] Yeah. Um or 20 like if you had a hund 25 you had a $100 million annual budget to do worldchanging translational juroscience. What would you be doing different? I I think the scale would be one. We just can't when you do a combination in mice, you've got four groups and I think we if we had more money, we could design sort of multiffactoral clinical studies and pre-clinical studies where we're testing many compounds at the same time. We're sort of doing nested groups, you know, and and we could get a indication for things that actually could be additive together. Uh not just things that are working on their own. Right now we struggle to get to that next step for finances and we could apply those to human studies and combine it with lifestyle interventions too. The other thing we really believe is that when you have a compound like uralithin, you're never going to really know what to combine it with unless you know what the compound's doing. So we do a lot of discovery stuff now trying to figure out not what pathway. If you take a drug like rapamy, it affects every hallmark.

[01:57:33] That doesn't tell you the primary thing the drug is doing. In this case, we know it binds to uryliththin. We don't know. So, we need to know what that molecule is binding to in the cell. And if we understand the mechanism at that level, we can combine it better with other interventions and start to understand how to put the puzzle together of what we need to combine to get the biggest effect.

[01:57:55] Do you have enough human resources to deploy that kind of capital if it were available? It would take a center to do it, but yeah, we could build it. And and Singapore is very motivated, by the way. I have to give the government credit. They've understood the aging problem before almost anybody. It's taken them a long time to really figure out what to do about it. And uh you know, so they went through kind of early stages of putting roofs on sidewalks so people walk an extra hundred steps in the hot sun. You know, that sort of stuff helps.

[01:58:24] But, you know, uh, but now I think they're really motivated to commit to to targeting Hellspan, which I, you know, if they do, it's the right place to be because it's a small island. It's a compliant population. They believe in the government population. It's 5 million and then one extra 1 million workers and 5 million people that live there permanently. Uh I think that it's a good place to to really take studies not just in the clinic but move them into the community and actually get validation in large populations and that's why I like being in Singapore. I think the opportunities there to make it a an example for how to do health span.

[01:59:01] It's already very long lived by the way so you know it's uh it's among the top three in the world depending on what statistics you want. But the health span people still have morbidity there. They still have 10 12 years of sickness and decline if you there's a lot of frailty there. You can see that just walking around. So there's room for improvement for sure. How will AI help in this field? Do you do you think it will allow for more intelligent experiments? Will it'll allow for better signal detection in messy data? Like I mean how do we unleash AI on this problem? using it now already for clocks and signal detection.

[01:59:38] We're using it to pick drugs now. Um where we just published a paper with Garrick Fulen in Germany where we're trying to um improve how to ask large language models question medical questions related to longevity. Uh you know I talk to a lot of doctors and they say that you shouldn't be asking perplexity these questions and I'm like

[01:59:58] I'm a realist people are asking. So let's figure out how to get them the questions asked in the right way to get the right answer. I'm thinking more in terms of the research. No. Yeah. I'm just giving you examples there. I think that um I think what's going to happen next is AI is going to start telling us what questions to ask. Right now, it's telling us how to analyze our data.

[02:00:17] It's still not very good at telling us what the next question is. And I think that that's the that's the sort of the how do we get it there? How do we how I mean this is a very difficult qu. It's not one that I'm qualified to answer, but I think that the question is the trajectory that it's on now is amazing.

[02:00:34] Is there a barrier to go to that next step or is it just a matter of getting computational power and slightly modifying neural network algorithms or something? And I I don't know the answer to that, but I do think there's a reasonable chance that that I'm not going to be needed in 10 years. So I I think about this question a lot when it comes to experimental topics because

[02:00:59] I still don't have a good enough sense of um what the how many training cases an AI needs to learn this like we know for language what it took. We understand how many tokens were needed to to to allow the neural networks to do what they do today and it was enormous. Yeah. So there are some problems that might require far less input.

[02:01:25] Y you might be able to do it with 10,000 hours of data. Yeah. Um as opposed to billions of hours of data. Yeah. So to me I think it's that's the question more than anything else. I have I was wondering if you had a point of view on the answer. Yeah. I don't really know. I I all I know is half my lab is doing it now. So it's I never would have guessed that five years ago. meaning they are trying to use AI to help them ask experimental questions.

[02:01:52] Yeah. Or or interpret data, you know, just Okay. The latter I can understand. Yeah. Yeah. It we've become half dry lab which I never would have guessed in my lab. So it's uh meaning that half the people just sit at computers and you know aren't doing experiments in animals. Yeah. So what are you most excited about trying to uncover truth or high probability of truth in the next 5 years?

[02:02:18] I think experimentally at least preclinally we want to find interventions that really combine together to have synergistic impacts. I don't think there's much out there. There's rapamy and metformin and a couple other things from the ITP but they're small effects. Can we break through a barrier and get 50 60% effects in mice by combining things together? I

[02:02:37] I think that's what preclinally we're excited about. And the other thing I'm excited about is going back to this entropy question. Are there new classes of interventions that change that primary um linear accumulation of of quote unquote damage? Um, I'm also really excited now that I'm working with longevity clinics in various countries and uh um so we're applying the clockway bill. We're also helping them try to decide which interventions to do and help hopefully collect data so it can be analyzed because I think there's so much going on. I I tell this joke all the time. I getting scared to tell it more, but um you know, it used to be that yeast and worms and flies were the model organisms for aging research, and now billionaires are the model organisms because they're doing all kinds of stuff. I can't even test. And I'm really curious to see what's happening. Some of it I I guess might work, some of it, I guess, might not work, but we're we can't find out any other way. And I I don't want to see these clinics working in in in isolation and nobody's ever at least learning what what's coming out of the data even if it's not perfect. So

[02:03:48] I'm excited to work with these clinics and and go see what they're doing right now. That's maybe not the answer to your question, but there's a lot of cutting edge stuff going on and I will pretty much work with people if they're doing something I consider safe and if they're honest about the data on efficacy. Those are the two things I ask, transparency and safety. And uh and then I'm happy to to like try to interact.

[02:04:12] What are you seeing that you're worried about? What trends do you see that people are doing from a from a biohacking longevity standpoint that that have you concerned? Uh either and I'll put this in two buckets. The the higher bucket would be safety. The second bucket would be predatory behavior around basically people getting, you know, having having their money wasted even if the agents that are being sold are not necessarily harmful.

[02:04:36] Yeah, I I think the first one I I I'm excited about gene therapy, don't get me wrong. I think it's interesting and it may really change the field going forward. I even kind of like phalaten uh but I'm fistaten as a protein. Yeah. Yeah. But I think that those treatments are not very well proven yet and I would not do it. I I asked the question, would I do it myself?

[02:04:56] Spend $100,000 for followatin gene therapy. I probably don't have to spend the money and I still haven't done it. Uh I I've done MSC's though IV to try that. And I think you know stem cells it's a it's a different question there. I think if you're repairing soft tissue damage or something like that and injecting them directly probably works. um for aging. I have no idea. But I think it's probably safe if you have a somebody that's a good practitioner that knows what they're doing. But I think there's a lot of this is a problem with stem cells. You go places and you really don't know who you're working with and you know if they're really treating the cells correctly, if you're putting the right things in your system. And so there there's a safety concern there based on the practitioner I think. Um and so those are things that concern me.

[02:05:46] I I I'm I haven't gotten totally on board with growth hormone yet. I mean, I think probably used correctly might be okay. The data is in interesting. Are you aware of human data that and I'm in your camp, by the way, which is I actually had a bunch of friends over for dinner last night and this came up and yeah, I was sort of I said, "Look, I I I can't point to a study that tells you this is this is a bad idea." And I've never spoken to a person who takes a modest judicious dose of growth hormone who doesn't tell me they feel better.

[02:06:19] I agree. So it's hard to believe it's not making people feel better. Um I also have never seen data to suggest it initiates cancer. Yeah. But it seems very biologically plausible that if you have cancer, small amounts of cancer, Yeah. your probability that this becomes clinically significant is higher in that case.

[02:06:40] Seems like it. Yeah. Um, again, I say that with no data. Yeah, me too. Uh, and so, yeah, my view has just been despite my own interest in trying things, I I've I've I've left the growth hormone one off the list. Um, is that an answerable question, do you think? Yeah. And I I I think we could do clinical studies on this, you know, and some are being

[02:07:03] How would we address the safety concern, right? Because you really need to be able to try to track people for quite a long period of time. The problem with the in all of these things, right? We we don't know what the long-term Yeah. is and and I guess, you know, it's it's a gray area. You know, this is a weird thing with these clinics, right?

[02:07:22] Because, you know, there's I think from what I read in your book, you're you're doing sort of validated stuff. Uh you're you're you're not really out there in the stratosphere doing crazy stuff that we don't know about. some of I would like to think I'm not but I'll tell you there are people who are very critical of my use of rapamy in in patients for for geroprotective reasons there are people who might think I'm crazy for giving people SGLT2 inhibitors who don't have diabetes so so I think there's things that we do not not for all of our patients and I I again I fewer than 10% of our patients take rapamy because my view is unless you're willing to have a very lengthy discussion about the pros the the risks, the uncertainties, and I don't give people an answer that says, "Oh, this is this stuff's amazing." My answer is, "I don't know."

[02:08:12] Uh, here's how I think about it probabilistically. Uh, here are the trade-offs. Um, and again, after after you can tell I'm not a good salesman if only 10% of the patients are taking it. Look, I I think that's perfectly reasonable. I but there's there clinics doing some really out there stuff and and uh that how do we know the long-term safety on it? We just I think I think if you're going to go do that stuff, you need to go in with your eyes open. You're you're taking a risk.

[02:08:40] I've just seen so many horror stories of people that have come back from parts of the because you can't do this a lot of the stuff you can't even do in the United States. So they're coming back from South America or Mexico, places in Asia having done folstatin therapy or other um sort of very questionable stem cell therapies. And

[02:08:56] I mean people that have had horrible infections like literally just artifacts of the treatment and that's a practitioner problem with the exact um yeah I but you know there's some great stuff happening too. I work with Bumongrat Hospital in Thailand and they've got a longevity clinic now and they're very grounded in good science and so you but the problem is if you're a um consumer for these products it's really hard to know you know so how how someone listening to us who's saying guys can you give me um give me some rules of thumb some heruristics for navigating the never uh neverending landscape of of uh longevity hacks that keep you know showing up on my Instagram feed, my Tik

[02:09:47] Tok feed and at cocktail parties. Yeah, I mean that could be new that could be diet books, not just going to clinics and the around the world. I think it's really difficult to sort that out and uh because it's what I was going to say is it it's it's clinical practice and research at the same time. It's a very unique situation, right? and and uh there aren't many examples of that that

[02:10:10] I know of that are really maybe some functional medicine is a little bit like that too, but it's uh it's interesting and and I feel like it's better for scientists to engage with, you know, where it's possible to engage with these clinics and try to help them than it is to just let people do things and, you know, and without if you can provide oversight that's helpful, you should be doing it. And so that's kind of how I feel about it. But it's uh a lot of a lot of academics don't even want to work with these clinics at all too. So and and so I I get criticized for working with them sometimes. So it's a it it's it's an interesting world right now.

[02:10:50] Well, there are a lot of things we talked about today, Brian, that I can't wait to follow up on myself. So I'm really looking forward to the NHANES uh second gen clock paper. That'll be interesting. Again, my personal curiosity there will be is that clock providing value over all the other data we have. My intuition is it won't. But the fact that we now at least have a clock that can outperform biologic age uh or pardon me chronologic age is a step in the right direction. Uh I'm going to be very interesting to see some of the data that you've talked about as far as alpha ketoglutarate. Um you've also piqued my curiosity with the sublingual um lad NAD, I'm sorry. And so that's that's really interesting. Have you been able to measure NAD levels in your RBCs?

[02:11:36] I haven't done it myself. There have been some studies done that on that exact supplement. Uh yes, I I'm I don't think anything is published. It's done by the company, but uh and I do like this idea of taking ITP winners and combining them and seeing if we can get I mean, if you could get accreative values, I mean, that would be remarkable. But even if you could just get additive benefit would be pretty amazing.

[02:12:04] Yeah. Yeah, I think so, too. Right now, I think that's still a hangup for the field. Well, this was super interesting, Brian. I um I I really appreciate you making the time to come out here. I know that being on a plane for that long is not always fun, but uh that's where I live anyway, so it's fine.

[02:12:20] Thank you. Thanks a lot. [Music]
