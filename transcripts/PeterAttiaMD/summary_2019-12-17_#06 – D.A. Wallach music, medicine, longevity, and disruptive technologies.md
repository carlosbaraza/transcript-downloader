## Description

Original release date: 7/23/2018

Recording artist, songwriter, essayist, investor, and so much more: D.A. Wallach is a true polymath. In this episode, among the highlights, D.A. provides compelling and colorful insight into how the music industry works today vs the past, liquid biopsies, how to approach healthspan, and how we can reach a “singularity” in medicine.

We discuss:
-How to learn music as a kid and an adult [7:30];
-Chester French’s early struggles and ultimate success [16:45];
-Learning to learn, fostering curiosity in kids, and balancing creativity with structure [31:30];
-D.A.’s musical inspirations [44:30];
-History of the music industry, Spotify, and other disruptive technologies [50:00];
-The past, present, and future of medicine, hospitals, and healthcare [1:05:30];
-Investing in health [1:16:30];
-What D.A. is most excited about in the future of medicine [1:22:00];
-Liquid biopsies, how to make sense of the morass of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, true negatives, false positives, false negatives, and true positives in cancer screening…and the Swiss cheese metaphor [1:33:00];
-The immune system, inflammation, and allergies [2:05:45]; and
-More.
