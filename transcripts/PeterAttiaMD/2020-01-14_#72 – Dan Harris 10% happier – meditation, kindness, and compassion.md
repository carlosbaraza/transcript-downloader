## Description

Original release date: 9/23/19

In this episode, Dan Harris, correspondent for ABC News and co-founder of the Ten Percent Happier meditation app, speaks openly about his struggles with self-centeredness, addiction, depression, emotional volatility, and the deep-rooted insecurities that drove him to career success. He tells the story of how a panic attack on live TV lead him down a path of self-discovery culminating in a meditation practice which has since transformed his life—in terms of his own personal suffering, his relationships with those closest to him, and his ability to be kind and compassionate (which has its own selfish advantages). Dan also shares some very practical advice and tips for new meditators, dispels some of the myths around meditation, and gives people some things to look forward to as they progress with their practice. Last but not least, we talk about the importance of not passing shame and trauma to our kids and the role that mindfulness and meditation plays in that.

-The overlap between psychology and Buddhism, who is the real Buddha, and a Buddhism 101 lesson [57:45];
-What convinced Dan to finally try meditation, and how did his first session go? [1:05:30];

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:17] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is Dan Harris for those unfamiliar with

[00:04:01] Dan he wrote the New York Times best-selling book 10% happier he also hosts the 10% happier podcast which I've appeared on and is the co-founder of the 10% happier meditation app which by the end of this podcast there will be no ambiguity about how much I love that app in addition to everything 10% happier Dan is also the co-host of weekend edition of Good

[00:04:22] Morning America and up until quite recently was the co-anchor of Nightline I met Dan through a very close friend of mine and this is one of those times when I specifically just begged my friend to make the introduction I read 10% happier almost the minute it came out in 2014 immediately became a fan and somehow who spent the last five years stalking him trying to figure out how to get to know him and eventually a friend of mine made the introduction and I kind of talked a little bit about that in the podcast about you know how much his work has had a just a profound impact on me and just how grateful I am for all that his journey into meditation has brought me you know in this episode we talked about a lot of things we do go into his story in a bit more detail about his upbringing and pretty quickly we get into the story of the breakdown meltdown slash crisis he had on national TV in 2004 that ultimately began his journey that culminated sort of four or five years later with his discovery of meditation and what I really liked about this episode truthfully is we get into a lot of stuff that I've always wanted to talk about with Dan and it's the exact stuff we would have talked about over dinner and the fact that we got to have it in a podcast is exactly why I have a podcast so I hope that you will find this discussion half as interesting as I did and I hope that for those of you who have not yet taken an interest in meditation that maybe the topics that we discuss here become the thin end of the wedge that at least get you to start exploring a tool that I believe is one of the most important tools in the longevity toolkit so without further delay please enjoy my discussion dan

[00:06:03] Harris for the podcast I want to just make a special announcement as you're about to hear in this podcast with Dan I'm a user an enormous believer promoter of the 10% happier app for meditating this is something that Dan and his team have been working on for several years I've been using it for nearly two years I think it is simply a remarkable tool and

[00:06:27] I recommend this app and one other app Sam Harris is app waking up to any one of my patients who is finally willing to take the plunge and try mindfulness meditation now one of the things we wanted to do at the time of the release of this podcast was work with the team at 10% happier to do a special subscriber discount code that's going to go along with the podcast release and they were kind enough to do this at an unbelievable amazing discount which is available for only one week until

[00:08:09] Saturday but anyway and this is cool to be doing it in an awesome studio like this I feel like this pretty cool stuff that's probably happened in this very room yeah I mean you we are sitting on the second floor of the ABC News headquarters and down the hall is where the late great Peter Jennings used to work so I've had some traumatic moments on the floor and I can't wait to dig into some of those he's definitely one of the most handsome people I've ever seen he's a handsome she's a general yeah statement of handsomeness double-oh-seven yeah yeah well I've wanted to have you on this podcast for such a long time

[00:08:45] I've wanted to meet you for a really long time probably about from the day I finished reading your book which would have been a little over five years ago I read your book cuz I read your book as soon as it came out in fact I pre-ordered it and as I've probably alluded to a little bit on the podcast before it's really your book that was the first thing that ever cracked the veneer of meditation is irrelevant you know that that's sort of ethos and your book is really almost single-handedly responsible for my interest in meditation and in some ways for where I find myself today which is in a much better place than I was then so I'd like to almost just start with that the title the book 10% happier I think it's just such a beautiful title because it doesn't over promise and it's just such a glib cute thing and what was the alternative title the voice in my head isn't asked which is just as good probably a little bit better technically as a title rather than just make you tell the whole story of the book take me back to the moment that started it you've talked about this and I know you're tired of talking about it I'm sure but maybe one more time what was the moment when you realized all was not well in Dan Harris land I've come to terms with the fact that I'm gonna tell the story a million times the inciting event of the book to put it in Hollywood terms was a panic attack not in this building but at our studio in Times Square where we do Good

[00:10:22] Morning America every morning it was 2004 warm June morning I was filling in for Robin Roberts who was at that time the newsreader on the show the newsreader we don't have this position anymore but it's the person who comes on at the top of each hour and reads off a bunch of headlines they've done a few big stories at this point and they'll say hey you know there are a few other headlines bubbling let's get it over to

[00:10:50] Robin Roberts or Dan Harris who's filling in for Robert and Roberts take it away so I had done this a bunch of times I was in a phase at this point where I was filling in for Robin and also the main host of the show Charl Charlie Gibson quite a bit they were giving me a shot and for reasons I don't fully understand why it happened this morning I was a couple seconds into my shtick I was gonna read 6 what they called voiceovers off of the teleprompter that was 20 feet in front of me so voice over is I'm talking to the camera but they roll video over what

[00:11:23] I'm saying and a few seconds in I just lost the ability to breathe my palms were sweaty my heart was racing my lungs seized up I just couldn't talk my mind was racing and the more my body freaked out the more of my mind freaked out in the more my mind freaked out the more my body freaked out and I had to do something I'd never done before which was just quit right in the middle of the whole thing and this is live this is live I later found out that the audience was 5.01 9 million and it was just terrible I lied to the people around me when they asked what had gone wrong I said I don't know it's fine and I was able to come on an hour later and do another bit so and if you look at it has a ton if you just google panic attack on live television it's the first result it has millions of hits if you look at it it actually doesn't look that bad well let's just say something about that if you've ever had a panic or high anxiety it will actually it's a triggering for those people if you haven't a response I hear from many people as you know it didn't look that bad which is true in the reason if I recall it was you were reading a bit about either a new statin yes a new drug recall yes as it's been so long since I've seen it cuz I don't think I saw it

[00:12:45] I watched it when the book came out yeah cuz I was like oh I wonder what he's talking about and I don't have seen it in five years yes well no reason to go back to it unless you're me if I hadn't had the luxury of tossing it the baton back to the main host then it would have been truly epic because I was I was unable to speak I would have had to rip the mic off and run away but I was able to get out the words back to Charlie and die and actually said back to Charlie and Robin when it was actually Charlie and Diane Sawyer that saved me it really doesn't matter because the it's not this isn't about thematic yeah it's not about it's about what led to the page exactly so even more embarrassing than the panic attack what caused it which is that I had spent a lot of time in war zones after 9/11 very ambitious guy and very idealistic and I want to say fearless but in the pejorative I didn't really think much about what the consequences of going overseas would be and so I was in Afghanistan and a bunch of times

[00:13:47] Pakistan Israel the West Bank Gaza I made a couple of trips to Iraq that all added up to about six months which spans the pre invasion invasion and then all the way up until the insurgency started really cooking and I came home in this period of time and I got depressed and I didn't actually know I was depressed I was having trouble getting out of bed and I felt sick a lot but I didn't know

[00:14:13] I was depressed a friend I was out one night going out to a party and a buddy of mine offered me some cocaine and I'd never I'd smoked weed & drank not really even to excess but I'd never had hard drugs I was always really afraid of them but because I was feeling like [ __ ] I don't know why I said yes that night and the cocaine made me feel better just like took it away in hindsight it I think it's pretty obvious I was depressed from coming home from the war zones not because I was traumatized but because I missed the action mm-hmm I liked it and I was in withdrawal from the adrenaline and the cocaine was a synthetic squirt of that adrenaline and it made me feel better obviously didn't last that long which is a hard lesson every coke user has to you learn and if you haven't used coke I recommend you don't well how does that relate to the panic attack after I freaked out actually happened to me twice I went to a doctor here in New York City was an expert in panic he asked me a bunch of questions one of the questions was do you do drugs which at this point you you're thinking that would never even register as a potential cause I even know I make this joke all the time was when I said yeah I do drugs he gave me a look and the look communicated the sentiment of okay [ __ ] mystery solved I wasn't a heavy cocaine user I was intermittent it was only on the weekends I wasn't high one of them the air or anything like that it was just I partied once in a while and he was like that's enough to change your brain chemistry and make it more likely for you to have a panic attack so that was a big aha moment and I quit doing drugs started seeing him frequently and that was really the beginning of me making a change and I want to talk so much about what came of that but I also want to kind of dig into a little bit of what got you here because I think there are a lot of people out there I mean

[00:16:01] I've had patients who have done a lot of cocaine or have done some cocaine and you know many of them still don't experience what you experience they may not van live television that's right there's the minute have the same provocation or the same stress that can produce that phenotype but I want to kind of go back to something that's maybe even at the root of all of that which was what was the void it maybe is the wrong word but what was the itch you were trying to scratch what was the the rush that you needed throughout your life I mean you I could never do what you do let's start with that right like

[00:16:35] I could never put myself out the way someone in your position puts themselves out it's it's kind of an amazing thing that you can talk to so many people every night you know like every day get your start in this whole space of news so in college I remember you writing about how you you know you worked at a local news station you get this big break to come to ABC you're getting a dopamine hit every time you do something good right do you have a sense of what that dopamine hit was numbing because I I do think that on some level cocaine perfectionism performance sex all of these things can numb have you ever read the book by

[00:17:23] Gabor maté a in the realm of hungry ghosts I haven't but I the Hungry Ghost is something I think a lot about it's a ancient Buddhist idea yeah I believe that's where he borrowed the title for the book and as you can imagine he writes a book about addiction but what I love so much about the book is he does a great job of making the case he's a psychiatrist and he mostly treats patients who are you know on Skid Row in

[00:17:49] Vancouver so usually opiate addicted but you read the book and you come away realizing wait a second like you could be a high flying news anchor you could be a you know Wall Street tycoon you're an addict - mm-hm so the big person on Skid Row for them the opiate or whatever drug of choice is lighting something up in their cortex it's a pleasure Center but you can get that from so many different things so I guess what I'm getting out in a long-winded way is when do you think your addiction or your junkie ism started was your career choice in any way driven by that which I would think for most of us on some level it is yeah

[00:18:29] I have been trying to think about this quite a bit recently because I don't think I really satisfactorily answered it in 10% happier I don't think that was really the point maybe I should have been or maybe I shouldn't have I don't know either way set it aside just at one point that's sort of adjacent when you talk about gab or Montes work I have a friend dr. Judson Brewer who actually might be a good guest for you he's a neuroscientist formerly of Yale now at

[00:18:57] Brown he's one of the lead neuroscientists in the fascinating push to figure out what meditation does to the brain but Judge is also an expert in addiction and he actually treats people clinically he wrote a book published by Yale University Press called a craving mind but his initial title was we're all addicted so it really goes to the fact that you don't have addiction these are my words not his and I don't know if he would have blessed them but I what I take from what he's saying is addiction is a spectrum you may think you're not an addict because you don't have a needle hanging out of your arm but that needle hanging out of your arm is just the extreme end of the spectrum but we're all addicted to lots of things you know what's your relationship with your phone what's your relationship with professional success what's your relationship with sex shopping gambling drinking we are rats and amazed you know and we go with the pellets are yeah and for the first time ever when I read my face book which I think I read in 2016 or 2017 there was a moment in when I realized those of us with the socially acceptable addictions actually have a disadvantage if there's one advantage to having a needle in your arm at least everybody realizes it's wrong and you're more likely to do something about health but if you're a perfectionist if you're a workaholic you're getting a lot of attaboys before someone comes along and says let's examine your relationship with this thing that's an excellent point so what drives me what makes Sammy run you know that book there was a moment when I was a kid my parents were both academic physicians and very prominent I mean I wouldn't want your mom especially right yeah my mom was one of the editors at the New

[00:20:43] England Journal of Medicine she's just about to retire my dad was chief of radiation oncology at the Brigham and Women's when one of the pioneers in radiation therapy but academic medicine doesn't pay that well and we we lived in Newton Massachusetts and I was really keenly aware of the fact that we were much poorer than a lot of the kids that

[00:21:04] I went to school with my dad Grover like a [ __ ] brown plymouth valiant and my mother a very bland chevy chevrolet or something like that and you know we had a had a nice house but it wasn't that nice vinyl siding and yet I knew you know one of my friends lived a couple doors down from 70 redstone and interestingly I also had a lot of

[00:21:26] Newtons a pretty big city so I also a lot of friends who lived in public housing but but it was the rich people that kind of got in my head and I felt insecure about that I also remember during this period my parents somehow took us on a trip to Europe and it was all paid for because they were gonna give a few talks lectures at various institutions around

[00:21:49] Europe but we were also gonna turn a lot of it into vacation most of the time we stayed in like not very nice places but when we went to Paris we stated a really fancy hotel that whatever local institution they were speaking at put us up at it's called the hotel Regina and it was really fancy and was the first time I'd ever been to a really fancy hotel how old were you I think 10 or 11 but I remember thinking this is how I'm gonna live I'm not gonna live like these

[00:22:16] Schmucks who didn't keep the heat on in the winter you will had to wear like down vests around the house because they were so intent there's so flinty they were so intent on saving money and I think there was something and I don't want to say it's not as simple as just saying it was the hotel Regina that did it but that to me seems like a defining moment the other thing I think that's going on that it only really started to get clarity on recently is I have an executive coach who I actually mentioned to you yeah I mentioned to you when you came on my podcast this guy's name is

[00:22:48] Jerry kelowna and Jerry is an executive coach but he's not interested in productivity hacks or how to get your next promotion or how to manage your inbox he is really interested in like what's your what are the primordial wounds in your life what's your five-year-old logic that is happening in the backdrop of your adult life and many ways controlling you like a malevolent puppeteer but that you don't have visibility on and he tries to help you see sort of look what are these characters in your head that are that have so much power over you especially when you don't see them and he often talks about the fact that as a young person there are three primary needs we have love safety and belonging and when I first heard him say that I said wow that's that's [ __ ] I don't that's pretty much my reflexive reflexive response to anything you're healthy scale yes I'm a healthy snob well I'm a skeptic sometimes it's healthy anyway so he's talking about love safety and belonging and I don't know Jerry's got a way that sometimes I have to reject his first for a for a while before I accept it but over time I started to realize a safety is actually something really important for me there is such a thing as intergenerational trauma my great-grandparents escaped the Cossacks another great-grandfather lost his family's meager fortune put his head in the oven and killed himself in the family kitchen lots of alcoholism depression poverty fortunes lost and made and lost in my family tree and you know my dad's an inveterate worrier so does my mother really if I'm being honest I think that the desire for I never felt unsafe in the home but I think the world has always felt unsafe to me and now having been raised during the Cold War which freaked me out so much I had to go see a shrink when I was a little kid I think part of the drive is the self-protection you mentioned one of your grandparents who had a pretty impressive temper was that a grandfather yeah Robert Johnson - my maternal grandfather he was raised and some like shitty farm in upstate New York by an abusive really abusive father was smart though when I got to got into Middlebury and then got married a girl at

[00:25:06] Middlebury and it was smart enough to get into Stanford to do a graduate degree in history who's gonna become a history professor but he had a kid my mother and then he had other and another and another ultimately five and they didn't have housing for kids at Stanford and he couldn't afford to go otherwise and basically lived the rest of his life in bruges a turd yes not only them but the world he became a middle manager at the yellow pages remember what the elevators were they said big Bible of telephone numbers that used to show up on our doorstep once a year and he was part of the part of that team but not a particularly successful part of that team really embittered and took it out on his kids and was a bully with them slapped him in the face figured out what their weaknesses were and and exploited them in public and I remember when I was a little kid he came in one day I came to his house and he took me into his living room to show me his VCR and said if he touched this I'll break your arm like that kind of guy fascinatingly in his 80s he became very nice he got a computer and he was really into Twitter and email and he would email all of his grandchildren and said this big radical change came over him later in his life did you ever get to talk to him about what precipitated the change no I didn't still alive he is not alive

[00:26:29] I don't know he would have taken that question didn't strike me as something that would be safe to ask have you ever talked with your mom about him and yes his impact on her life and maybe what she's transmitted of that to her kids either directly or indirectly through trying to avoid patterns she definitely

[00:26:49] I think both my parents tried to my dad's parents were quite kind but they had flaws of their own I think both of my parents had this idea that they were not gonna repeat the mistakes their parents had made and they were really good parents but recently I've been talking my mother more about her relationship to her father because I'm writing a book about compassion and kindness which are two words that most men don't want to talk about much and they're just kind of to my ears kind of

[00:27:17] I'm almost slightly embarrassed to have them pass my lips but I think there's gonna be a way to talk about this stuff that can be more attractive and aspirational because we clearly need it and we need it as human beings we need it as a culture for me it's important to understand my mother's relationship to this guy because I see so much of him and me so I got to reckon with it you have a brother and a sister or just a brother just a brother yeah did did any of that get transmitted to him in the same way do you feel does your brother have feel that he has some of his grandfather in him I don't think so my brother's a pretty men'she guy you're just widely beloved he's a very prominent venture capitalist and within that community which I now know better as a start-up co-founder his reputation is just people really like him he's got a wide wide circle of friends and is very its kind of relaxed and affable my wife has referred to him as the nice Harris so I don't see he's got his own stuff you're sure we all have stuff it's not the kind of Stern authoritarian vibe that I can emit so I want to come back to the story but I want to sort of go off on one little tangent room and you said that the words kindness and compassion you almost feel a little uneasy when they pass your lips or you said something to that effect why is that because I think this the words are encrusted in so much cultural stuff like cliche I don't know that we found a great way to talk about kindness and compassion its hallmark II

[00:29:00] Louie gooey meaningless cliche or it's bland dogmatic exhortation figure wagging God is watching type of stuff it's not often sold to us the way it can actually be sold to us which is in terms of our own self-interest there's a lot of evidence that shows that people who are compassionate or happier healthier more successful more popular and it feels good on a moment-to-moment basis it feels good we are wired to get feel-good chemicals released into our brain when we're goods other people just by way of an example what does it feel like when you hold the door open for somebody if you're mindful in that moment if you're awake that feels good well that is infinitely scalable not to the point where we have to be an idiot or in the fedora the hole won't be a doorman which you know I love my doorman they're definitely not idiots but they can do that job which is great

[00:30:00] I'm glad they do it but they could do lots of other jobs the point isn't the holding of the door the point is that you can my meditation teacher is a great little rule that I've been trying to operationalize which is if he notices the impulse to give something arise he does it so how many times during the day is the impulse to like maybe you know I could compliment somebody on on her shoes or his shoes but you don't do it for one reason another or you know you send that note to that person just to say they did a great job on something or walking down the street and you know you got two bucks in your pocket but you don't really want to make eye contact with the person standing outside of Starbucks asking for money no actually just do the giving why not because you're rah-rah just trying to make the world a better place man do it because it feels good for you and by the way yes it will make the world a better place and lots of unpredictable ways but my sales pitch here is that and I wrote a chapter about this and 10% happier called the self-interested case for not being a dick and that's just a jokey way of putting it because it's me it's me struggling with how to talk about this incredibly important subject in a way that avoids all of the cliches that have made it so meaningless to so many people we all kind of vague leave want to be nice or or we think we're good people we've thought about it we certainly want other people to be nicer but I don't know there's only one self-help book that I can think of that's been successful about compassion and that book does not advertise compassion on its cover the book is called how to win friends and influence and if you read it which I happen to recently do it's actually a book about compassion that's been kind of inspirational for me and thinking about like how can you find a way to talk about these things in a way that people will actually listen it's so funny you bring this up because just by total coincidence I think yesterday the meditation I did in your app so for the listeners if you haven't figured it out by now which means you haven't been listening to my podcast which is fine I still forgive you but Dan is the co-founder of an app called 10% happier which along with another app that I've talked about a lot waking up are really the cornerstones of my meditation practice and I've probably also talked you probably heard me talk about Joseph

[00:32:21] Goldstein Jeff Warren is a couple of the teachers that I really really like in this app and I think it was just yesterday I did a lesson I think Joseph I'm pretty sure it was Joseph and it was talking about how even your physical characteristics change in a moment of conflict choose to do the kind thing versus the nod so sure enough

[00:32:43] I do my meditation in the morning I go to the gym in San Diego I have the luxury working out at home which I love because I can be alone I'm kind of a loner but in New York I go to a you know Big Crunch gym right which always puts me in a little stressed state because I'm that guy who likes to be able to control everything and I want to be able to do a circuit between these two machines back and forth back and forth or sure enough I'm doing that and I'm using a machine but when I'm off the machine another guy sits down at the machine okay no problem

[00:33:11] I'm a civil enough guy to go up to him and afterwards say hey do you mind if I work in with you but he says no like I'm gonna sit on this machine until I'm done and I don't want to trade I don't want to share with you and I said you realize it's a machine we ought to do is switch the pin and he goes yeah but I don't want to now again old Peter or maybe normal Peter that would turn into an escalation but I had just listened to this meditation that Joseph had done that day about how my external manifestation could change if I could be kind in that moment and I said okay no problem I'll wait till you're done I just walked away and did something else

[00:33:53] I've really thought about it for the next three or four minutes and sure enough a I stopped being upset about it very quickly and this is gonna sound crazy but within about five minutes I felt bad for him I started thinking oh he probably feels like a jerk now because I haven't put up any fight I've been very kind and pleasant and I'm worried about him I'm worried that this guy is over there thinking to himself what I'd be thinking if I were in his shoes which is why didn't I just share with this guy so you're right let's be completely transparent this is total self-interest yes I just want to feel better I'm just tired of feeling ashamed of myself that's right this is not me making this up the Dalai

[00:34:34] Lama has got a reasonably good pedigree on the issue of kindness and compassion says that there is a kind of selfish that's called wise selfishness it's the ultimate form of selfishness it is to be kind because you will be happier and there's all this data to suggest not only we'd be happier but also healthier and more popular as I was saying before nobody tells us this and that's why this is the book I'm working on now and my ideas are not fully formed so you're hearing me speak kind of early on before

[00:35:11] I have my stick down which may be good may be bad I don't know we'll have you back when the shtick is ready but I like free stick discussion the priest it yeah yeah well I mean now maybe I'll figure things out by just talking about it but I really think we are on some levels we are selfish so I'm trying to we don't generally do things unless there's a back to my rats and amaze an algae have unless there's a pellet in it for us and

[00:35:37] I I fear that the way kindness is discussed is like the Care Bears or some religious figure in robes wagging his finger at you that doesn't strike me as scalable especially at a time where we really need this we've got epidemic levels of anxiety depression suicide especially among young people and we have epidemic levels of political polarization we've got global problems that require cooperation like climate change this is the time where we actually need to start pulling our heads out of our asses so

[00:36:10] I'm excited to see if I can make a little contribution in this way how much of understanding this concept you've described do you think requires understanding its counterpart so you know you and I've spoken before about this idea of the numbing effects of anger and grandiosity which in this short term are incredibly numbing I mean they are beautiful and aesthetics for sort of the maladaptive mind kindness and compassion are antidotes to that do you think it's necessary for a person to understand the nature of their addictions their shames their drives to these other counterparts to kindness and compassion or do you think you could say no look you never need to explore those things you never need to understand those you don't need to start exploring the relationship behind with your grandfather or your childhood and instead you can just focus on the behavior change one interaction at a time well I'll speak for myself I think for myself it's been very important to explore it and it's useful I'm it's like you got to figure out the pain of holding onto the hot coal which then it feels really good to drop it so for me seeing both the psychological content of you know exploring my relationship to my grandfather etcetera etcetera but also the moment by moment mental processes what it feels like to suffer right now really help you reorient the fact that it feels good there's an expression about anger from the Buddha that I think is useful which is that he said it has a honey tip but a poison root

[00:37:47] I think the prerequisite for me foreseeing that is mindfulness so in other words having self-awareness mindfulness is just the ability to know what's happening in your head at any given moment without getting carried away by it this is a skill that we developed through meditation but there are other ways to do it but I think meditation is the cleanest clearest way to if you a couple minutes a day of meditation helps you have more visibility on your own inner weather and then you're not so yanked around by it and I think having that mindfulness on board can show you that anger sucks it feels bad it may feel good if initially it's a good release of energy but then it's in your system for a while it takes a long time to detoxify a same with the grandiosity it feels off to be tuned your own horn as much as somebody like me is prone to do I feel now that I've got enough meditation onboard and just like it doesn't feel good when I'm being braggadocious or even suddenly something even that it's to me they're really they're really dangerous grandiosity because that's so obvious is is the grandiosity when I'm in the line at the airport and the TSA guy pulls my suitcase out of the line because of no reason apparently at all and decides to take 20 minutes to come and check out what's in it so that that means I don't get to buy lunch before I get on my flight it's the I'm so much better than you why don't you get over here and do your job

[00:39:22] I'm doing my job do you know how hard and you're not saying any of this to anybody but you're thinking it right like do you know how hard I work do you know the effort I put into my job why don't you work as hard at what you do as what I do and the lava that's the grandiosity that I think is the absolute poison and I just think if I'm going to be brutally honest with myself that's the biggest struggle that I have here is that inner one-upmanship and I mean I love that expression about anger I completely agree with it and I you know my therapist has shared that one with me many times and it's you know we're gonna talk a lot about meditation but you're absolutely right mindfulness is what has even allowed me in in the moments of anger to realize what the half-life is of the honey I read it a tiny bit of a book called [ __ ] a theory and it was like a kind of an academic treatise on [ __ ] and it said the quintessential [ __ ] rallying cry is don't you know who I am yeah and again you may never utter those words I don't think I've ever uttered those words you know they've never come out of my mouth but I've thought them oh yeah me too end the half-life of the honey is so short and the shame that follows actually precipitates the following grandiose act like that cycle is so vicious that's good that you see it and that's really important seeing it is huge so let's go back because we're gonna jump around a lot but I would go back to the meltdown fast-forward your therapist finally gives you the aha moment your start and I assume that he's helping you come to the grips with Dan you're a bit of an addict right you're addicted to the high of your job which is soothing you it's soothing something let's put aside for the moment what's being soothed what was the next step in your evolution to exploring this let me do the following I know there's so much we want to talk about though we won't get into it

[00:41:23] I'll just tell the listeners that unrelated to all of this you'd been given an assignment at work which was to sort of explore and probe the growing religious movement something that you didn't find remotely interesting initially but being the good soldier you are you're sort of going through this and is it safe to say that the work you'd been doing in understanding religion created kind of a an opportunity for you to also start exploring the spirituality of mindfulness is that affair okay yeah

[00:41:56] I'll let you finish it in more eloquent terms sure I mean the assignment was given right here on this floor in the second floor of ABC News is it Peter Jennings that you made me cover faith and spirituality which I did not want to do and raised in the People's Republic of Massachusetts not particularly interested in this kind of stuff I'd like to tell the joke about the fact that I did have a bar mitzvah but only for the money so it's not not on my radar as an important subject but it ultimately was great for me because first of all I learned a lot about faith in spirituality which was I was totally ignorant on the subject and I made a lot of new friends and I just it brought me into parts of the world that I wouldn't have otherwise seen and it also ultimately brought me to meditation in particular it came in the form of a self-help writer named Eckhart Tolle one of my colleagues here at ABC News recommended that I read one of Eckhart

[00:42:48] Tolle ease books because she thought maybe he would be a good story for us and I read the book and I thought at first I was reading the book and I was like this is [ __ ] [ __ ] like really hardcore just awful and Oprah had basically anointed him oh yeah she she talked about that what she did this whole she had him on the show and then she did a whole digital series with him and then she told everybody that she'd put copies of his books in every bedroom of every house she owns and then Paris

[00:43:17] Hilton was seeing carrying one of his books when she went it's to jail to do time for DUI like there was a whole moment there in like 2006 7 8 where Eckhart Tolle was you know negative he was bigger he was their guru and I was you know I react poorly to all of those kinds of things and his writing has a lot of grandiosity in

[00:43:37] I talks about spiritual awakenings and now he had a spiritual awakening and then he lived on park benches in a state of bliss for a couple of years in London and he talks about vibrational fields there's a lot in there not to like if you're me I have to be honest I couldn't read the book it's the first time I tried zart because even though and looking I should go back and reread it now but at the time at least this sort of metaphysical nonsense just it was just too much like I just couldn't it became such a barrier to entry I agree completely it reads better to me now yeah I suspect it might as well to me well what he does do when he's lucid is describe our inner lives in an incredibly incisive manner he talks about how we have an ego but which he's not talking about the way egos used in our culture now is like oh yeah that guy's got a big ego yeah yeah he's a jerk but he means that we all have this running dialogue this inter narrator this voice that chases you out of bed in the morning and is yammering at you all day long and it's just blah blah blah all day long thinking about the past or thinking about the future to the detriment of whatever is happening right now our mutual friend sam harris has this joke but when he considers the voice in his head he feels like he's been hijacked by the most boring person alive who just says the same [ __ ] over and over most of it negative all of its self referential and tollis argument is when you're not aware of this non-stop conversation it owns you that to me was incredibly powerful first of all because it just seemed intuitively true and second because it described or it explained the most embarrassing moment of my life my panic attack the voice in my head was why I went off to cover wars without thinking about the consequences came home got depressed was insufficiently self-aware to even know it and then blindly self-medicated and it all just blew up in my face so that was reading tollis book was incredibly powerful for me my problem with totally and I did ultimately you did do an interview with Thatcher Arnold I recall your hometown of flew to Toronto and interviewed the man and first thing I asked him was it was interesting is the first time my whole covering with the religion beat where I felt like I had skin in the game I was really excited you wanted to know I wanted to know wanted what this guy had by the way

[00:46:00] I didn't think he was foolish I didn't think it was a charlatan and I had interviewed many charlatans yep but he was weird yeah and frustrating the first thing I do is I said well you know what do you do about the voice in the head you clearly you're saying something that seems to me to be indisputably true except for I don't know what do you see how do you actually tame it you acknowledge that there's a jerk sitting in the corner how do you make him stop talking there's no practical advice in the book so I thought he maybe would be able to reveal his wisdom to me in person and the first thing he said was take one conscious breath and the voice in my head was like and I asked him a bunch in a bun over and over and over and he just didn't say anything that made sense I like I understood the individual words he was using but not in the order in which he used them so I left that interview quite frustrated I knew deliver in the interest of time I won't go into too much detail but I spent a little bit of time noodling around in the self-help world generally her story about Deepak is yeah pretty awesome time you at least that one's my favorite Deepak and I started hanging around a little bit and I liked about

[00:47:09] Deepak is actually more relatable in person than Eckhart Tolle but Deepak talks in this way that's like it literally makes no sense he uses casually used the term with me one day the transformational vortex to the infinite that's just the kind of [ __ ] he just says all the time so he was even more confusing and I definitely didn't believe he was enlightened because he was checking his phone all the time and you know in non-stop in perpetual motion always just hustling which by the way I don't say as a criticism I really liked him but he just seemed as miserable as I was in terms of professional desire at least Eckhart Tolle seemed like blissed-out anyway I ultimately realized and and Deepak helped me realize this that the mechanism one can use for taming the voice in the head is meditation and I was not positively predisposed to the idea of meditation because

[00:48:05] I it felt like it comes with some baggage yeah I mean it was I often say it was it is the victim of the worst marketing campaign for anything ever because the traditional artwork shows people you know sitting in an impossible position floating off into the cosmos the rest of us sit to meditate and either were in a bunch of pain or were noticing that were distracted and we don't feel at all like that and therefore we think we're failed meditators in fact the experience of meditation is this constant humiliation where you sit you try to focus on one thing at a time usually it's the feeling of your breath coming in and going out and then you're distracted over and over and over again but the game and meditation is simply to notice you've become distracted and in the moment that you notice you've become distracted throw a little party for yourself because you are waking up from the automatic pilot the daydream of your the hallucination of your life there's constant discursive thinking and then you're actually here now paying attention and so the whole game of meditation is not to stop thinking which is impossible it's to notice when you become distracted and start again and again and again and finding out that the process was that simple and that there's an enormous amount of science that strongly suggests that it's really good for you I don't want to overly hype the science because I think that it's still in its early stages but it really certainly looks like a little bit of meditation every day can do quite a bit good and that is what got me over the hump to start have you read the book altered traits yes I think that that book does such a great job explaining that we don't meditate for the state we meditate for the trait and that's hard to explain to people until they actually try it there's an app out there there are many that are you know tracking your heart rate and your heart rate variability and levels of calmness during meditation and I've tried these apps and come to the realization that at least for me they don't make any sense because I don't find meditation generally to be that enjoyable sometimes

[00:50:07] I do by the way like you know we talked about how I'm fasting this week something about fasting makes meditation really amazing new sharpens the mind yeah there's just a much deeper connection but there were many days when my meditation is very difficult it's really hard to do everything that you just described so that's this state right it's not a blissful state at all but what I'm interested in is listen if I meditate for 20 minutes in a day

[00:50:33] I'm not meditating for those 20 minutes I'm meditating for the other 23 hours and 40 minutes those are the traits that I want and therefore to me at least an app that was helping me assess my the change in my state during 20 minutes is not nearly as interesting as a reflection on how is this gonna help me

[00:50:52] Act the next time the TSA guy seemingly singles me out which of course is a ridiculous thought but you don't I mean well I've always found this distinction helpful and by the way going back to the whole drug thing I view the entire distinction on drugs to be somewhat arbitrary right like is cocaine generally a drug that is good or bad in my opinion very bad why because it's a drug that only impacts your state but not your traits in a favorable way so it gives you a positive state and then a negative set of traits in the long run

[00:51:25] I've ever been around somebody didn't cook it's not that positive oh yeah pitching you on new business yeah this awesome new cat-food idea it's the best cat food conversely when you look at things like psychedelics psilocybin MDMA which is not technically I mean sort of a quasi psychedelic but I think these drugs plants for maybe lack of a better word when done correctly under these therapeutic settings are remarkable not so much because of the state which they clearly alter but much more because they can change the traits outside of them which is something by the way the authors have altered traits argue against their view is that meditation is the only way to use the state to change the trait but that's that's that's sort of another issue so kind of listening to you talk about that I realize this is a distinction that it can't be stated enough to someone who's new to meditation which I'm hoping some people listening are it says it's easy to get discouraged it's music to my ears to hear you say that Richie Davidson and and Danny Goldman wrote that book they actually sat in the chair you're sitting and now you're we're doing this at ABC

[00:52:32] News in where I record my podcast and they both been on my show many times together and separately and I think it's an excellent point and it's what trips up so many meditators because they sit to meditate and they think they should feel a certain way mm-hm and then they conclude that they're failures because they're not feeling a certain way but the point of meditation is not to feel any specific way it's to feel whatever you're feeling right now so that you learn how not to let your feelings push you around and yes of course the real-world application of that is that you're better at life we don't meditate as is often said we don't meditate to get better at meditation you meditate to get better in life now just to be clear though over a period of time as as you and some people get to this point and some others don't but if you're getting to the point where you're starting to get actually quite serious about the meditation practice at some way actually might want a teacher because getting better at the meditation itself actually can have lots of benefits that doesn't mean the meditation is gonna be fun it just means that you can technically understand the nuances of your own mind and the nuances of various practices at differing levels and that I think can have a positive effect on your practice and on your life and it creates a kind of a virtuous cycle I'm getting ahead of myself here the thing to know primarily for meditators is don't get hung up on feeling calm or blissful or anything like that just tune in on your ability to see clearly whatever is happening right now if what is a distraction is it knee pain is it an itch whatever it is

[00:54:14] Pleasant or unpleasant because what we're training over time is the ability to notice that anger has come upon us off the cushion in our regular lives and can you resist the urge to say something that's gonna ruin the next 48 hours of your marriage that's where the rubber hits the road it's so powerful and I kind of remember the first time I was able to see the train coming before it hit it still hit to be clear I wasn't able to stop the train but the fact that

[00:54:43] I realized oh the train started over there and it rolled there bang verse is always just seeing impact impact impact the glass half full approach of that realization is okay maybe the next time you could slow the train down and what if one day you could stop the train the train hitting something being a metaphor for the you actually saying that thing that's going to nuke that relationship let's pause for a moment and explain the distinction maybe between mindfulness and being present I believe my children especially the two little boys are very present I don't think they're anywhere but in the present I absolutely don't think they have a shred of mindfulness in them how would you explain that distinction to people the way my meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein talks about it is like a Labrador it's not the similar forgot to similar for you if I have a four-year-old boy myself you look at a Labrador he's she or he is pretty present which is to say they're probably not thinking about what they're gonna eat tomorrow and they're not thinking about the dog that barked at them yesterday s they're not they're not a lot of neuroses they're not swept up in ruined past decisions or fretting over the future or whatever they're just right there doing whatever eating the kibble sniffing some other dogs but chewing your sweat socks pooping on the rug they're right there for all that being present is necessary but not sufficient for mindfulness so you need to be present but then there's a meta cognition that also happens which is you know that you're in the present moment and you know that you know you're in the present moment we are classified as Homo sapiens sapiens the one who thinks and knows he or she thinks and that second sapiens has atrophied over time because nobody bothers to point out to us that we're capable of this we have this ability to step out of the stream of our consciousness and notice yeah there's I'm having all these thoughts

[00:56:42] I'm having all these urges I'm having all these emotions and to not be carried away by them and by the way you're not gonna step out of the stream forever like you can just do this for a nanosecond at a time and just to see quickly oh yeah I'm having all these racing thoughts that's almost a B and sapiens knowing and knowing that your knowing dogs can't do that your boys can but it's not very well developed mine can't but yeah I my son last night was aggressively for 10 minutes trying to get me to smell his socks and he was like daddy they don't smell that bad I'm telling you the truth

[00:57:22] I'm like dude you're lying and how I know this cuz you have the same face I have and I'm looking at it and that's how I lie and yeah it was like Karma my wife was dying cuz I'm always messing with my wife it's one of the hallmarks of our relationship with me just kind of being a jokester with her she's like this is karma your son is you mmm so what was your first foray into a mindfulness based practice of meditation so in this period of time when I was checking out at carto Lee and Deepak

[00:57:52] Deepak my wife gave me a book by a guy named dr. mark Epstein amazing human who you've had on a podcast twice I believe yeah and he's a real friend I read the book and I realized oh wow everything that I like about Eckhart Tolle was lifted without attribution from somebody known as the Buddha Epstein's books are all about the overlap between psychologies as practicing psychiatrist here in New York City and he he's written these beautiful books about the overlap between psychology and Buddhism

[00:58:19] I didn't know anything about Buddhism but it was very clear that all this stuff about the voice in the head which the Buddha refers she was the monkey mind really these thousands of years old much of this philosophy honed by a guy heretofore known to me as a lawn ornament but the Buddha is a fascinating guy and really really smart and and the

[00:58:40] Buddha that you're talking about is actually kind of different from the big bellied lawn ornament the only different entities altogether the big fat guy is known as the Laughing Buddha I think okay that's not the Buddha that's not the historical Buddha but there are plenty of you go to a spa that probably had the skinny one that's the Buddha but they didn't make any representational art of the Buddha until hundreds of years after he died when did he live he lived 2,600 years ago Oh 600 ish BC mmm and lived where Indian I think he was born in what is now Nepal but then was all over India and talked a little bit about his path hey what we know what the legend is because again we think there was a guy named the Buddha but what's been passed down to us is quite sort of mythological in terms of his biography so we know his name was reported to be Siddhartha Gautama and he was born according to the legend in - he was the son of a king he was a prince like a kind of a minor King and he's mother died in childbirth or shortly thereafter and some wise man told his father this kids either going to be a great ruler or a sage and the father really did not want him to be a spiritual leader he wanted him to take over the job of being a king and so built this world for him where he would be not exposed to any suffering so just you know fanned by palm leaves and fed whatever the best cuts of the goat and surrounded by women and musicians etc etc against the legend and at some point he gets out for a tour of the local village or the local city and normally they clean everything up somehow through suffering he sees and a scenes what are called the three I think three heavenly messengers he sees a old person a sick person and a dead person and he realizes that this whole thing he realizes something that we all should know everything is impermanent suffering is a part of life and if you try to pretend otherwise you're gonna suffer even more then he runs off into the forest where he spends six years in these he's in his 20s here and he has a kid who he's named

[01:00:57] Rahula which is poli I believe for Fedder so speaks to what kind of dad he was he viewed his kid as a sort of an impediment flawed human being again this is all legend here but runs off to the forest spend six years studying with great meditation masters in the fashion at the time was to do this self-mortification thing where you like inflict a lot of pain you don't eat you stand in funny positions you hang upside down whatever and he was doing he was like became the best at this he all truly realized that this is he was still suffering so one day he actually ate a little bit and stopped starving himself and sat down under the

[01:01:43] Bodhi tree a big famous tree in Bodhgaya India and said I'm not getting up until M enlightened again this is all legend he sat there for a long time ultimately got enlightened and at a big battle in his head with the God of desire and he transcended greed hatred and confusion and went off and delivered his after he got enlightened he went off and found some of his former monks and delivered his seminal speech which was the Four

[01:02:11] Noble Truths which are one that life is suffering which is a mistranslation sufferings a bit of a mistranslation but the idea is that everything is impermanent if you try to cling the things that will not last you will suffer so life is unsatisfactory inherently because nothing lasts to the root of that suffering is desire or thirst this kind of insatiability we have and three there's a way out of this and for the Eightfold Path which is the way out of it which includes meditation practices ethical practices like right livelihood right speech right action and then a bunch of meditation techniques like mindfulness and philosophical stuff about like how to view the world that's Buddhist Buddhism 101 yeah I mean does it does it kind of amaze you that's something that came to an individual or even individuals plural 2600 years ago could prove to be so relevant today yeah well so I mean my question is whether this story that I just told you is in any way true is it possible that this philosophy was it's possible this was just built upon and evolving over time first he was probable to me more sure the Buddha if he was a guy if he really was a guy I think he probably was there was somebody in the Buddha he was standing on other people's shoulders but he had some real innovations including mindfulness

[01:03:36] I guess what's amazing to me is regardless of whether it was one guy many guys how it took et cetera et cetera there's no doubt that what you just said the Four Noble Truths were devised in a period of time when no one could have imagined or predicted the world we live in today and yet here we are in a world today and it's important to stake a step back here and think about the suta lens of evolution right as a species we are no different today than we were 2600 years ago

[01:04:05] I mean 2600 years represents less than 1% of our genetic journey identical species but if you think about the world 200 years ago no electricity right no irrigation no sewer no nothing nothing nothing and you think about the world today again not just 200 years later but call it 2600 years later you simply couldn't imagine like there is no one with an imagination that could have come up with what we're going to be living in today and yet in some ways what you just said is more important today I can't imagine it was as important 2600 years ago but it also tells you about the perennial nature of human suffering wheeshes it's incredible it's unbeliev s but the the Buddha had good news it wasn't some death defying dogma where you know look week I can at least not the way I understand her practice it wasn't telling you that you can have eternal life for if you just believe everything I say unquestioningly it was more like look don't take he seeks bliss

[01:05:05] Allah said don't take anything I'm saying on faith values try it out for yourself here's some meditation techniques and you might be able to reduce the amount of suffering your you are experiencing much of a kind of voluntary in the face of life's inevitable vexation vexations and vicissitudes and I have been trying this out for 10 years and in my experience there's a lot to it and the science that has looked at it too has also been interesting so how did you go from the meeting with mark or the meetings with

[01:05:35] Mark cuz I know you talked about multiple meetings and to say I'm gonna I'm gonna give this thing a try and then ultimately what I really want to hear about is your first extended meditation retreat which is something I'm so fascinated reit well but but even before that because you'd obviously been practicing meditation before you went on the retreat so what was the for a sceptical guy like you what got you over the hump of alright

[01:05:58] Dan you're gonna put your BlackBerry down you're gonna sit in this position and you're gonna focus on your breath like how did you make that leap or was it relatively easy to make after everything you've been through in the journey no I mean I was really intrigued by Buddhism as a philosophy you cannot overstate the power for me of that initial at cart Olli lifting of the curtain on my own mind like wow my the voice in my head is an [ __ ] and I'm suffering all the time as a consequence of this and then the Buddha's philosophy which I think says it way better was also interesting I was just reading lots of books about it talking to Marc about it and the meditation practice as the corrective is just it's unavoidable as soon as you start it's all really slowly in some ways is really credited for being the first person that showed you what we would now as people who meditate take for granted which is there's a thinker of thoughts those thoughts are not us yes and what neither is the thinker yeah exactly that's the transition that's very difficult which maybe if we have time to I'd love to get into that so you're basically saying look I was already so primed because I realized the most important of the truths the how to tame that I was I was so thirsty for that then basically when someone I came to trust and respect like mark Epstein who was completely rigorous completely righteous not a fraudster when he basically said look this is it this is just a practice you're just gonna do start doing this thing that was pretty that was an easy step I wouldn't say it was easy but it got Kinsella so yes that and also seeing the science the science was a huge deal for me and when it just became obvious I can lower my blood pressure you know I can boost my immune system there's all these brain scans that show that you can have an effect on your prefrontal cortex and your amygdala and like that was all very compelling - you know what's really funny just as a sort of aside for as much as I obsess over data and everything I do whether it's this type of exercise this type of nutrition blah blah blah the science has had the least impact on my interest in meditation relative to anything I ever done in fact I would argue that if you told me meditation raised my blood pressure 10 points I would still do it for the benefits on the reduction of my suffering and I would just figure out more drugs to take to lower my blood pressure to compensate for it like I literally couldn't care less about that science which is not to be dismissive of it no it's just to say that I don't care about any of that I care about one thing because there are an infinite number of ways to lower my blood pressure you know do X Y & Z there's only one way I know about understand the nature of my mind which is an awful awful demon I strongly strongly strongly agree with you I use the science primarily if not exclusively as an evangelical tool mm-hmm because I know how powerful it was for me as a skeptic oh yeah you know even if I don't believe this thing's gonna make me happier hey apparently does this other stuff for me and I I'm always trying to optimize so might as well do it for that reason my experience the science gets people over the hump and then they no longer care because once you've done it for six weeks or so and you realize you're less of a [ __ ] you don't care if your prefrontal cortex might look different in MRI there's cut early irrelevant right so for me it's really useful as because my job is to get people to meditate and science is enormous ly helpful there anyway it was helpful for me at this back in this stage at 2009 and ultimately I was I was on a beach vacation with my wife and some friends we had a house the beach and I was reading another yet another book about the stuff I was kind of I think for 10 or 11 years now I've read no books other than books on meditation and Buddhism will you read my book when it comes out

[01:09:52] I will like I can't I kind of count that so maybe happiness would be a better way to say that would help improve myself a movement yeah although I love novels I think I've read I've only read one in that whole time me too by the way yes stopped reading fiction in 1999 so that's 20 years ago but I three years ago read The Alchemist but that's kind of a isn't that kind of bigger than action yeah but there's so much good fiction on tell that I feel like I'm getting that yes so anyway I said my blackberry down because this was 2009 and I went into the bedroom where I was staying with my wife close the door didn't want anybody to see me because this before meditation was cool I did not want to admit to anybody I was doing this I kind of sat on the floor set a timer and I tried to watch my breath coming in going out again and going out and immediately there was like a million thoughts you know where did yours run a while bla bla

[01:10:51] I was gonna actually bring in my copy of your book I still have you know the hardcover first thing we came out and I was gonna do it just to read that that's one of the funniest parts of the book and you do it I think three times in the book you do the these are my thoughts and I remember the first time reading about how hard I laughed thinking I'm not the only one like I'm not the only one whose mind is an idiot yeah just just an abject idiot well I think the fact that both of us share an affection for flesh it's like a torrent of thought yes that's our in there like how ridiculous there how ridiculous there it's amazing I get some like my best jokes in meditation and then you know I share them with my wife would just says you are an idiot and my son who also thinks I'm a [ __ ] you get a sense of humor about it which i think is really important the kind of grandiosity and randomness and negativity and ceaseless self referentiality of it can be kind of funny so that first experience was humbling but I actually got up after the five minutes thinking wow I suck at this but but you saw oh you saw a light oh absolutely I knew this was this was serious so this is this is big this is a at this point almost a three year journey didn't this I know the panic attack was in oh four but was it oh six that you really an earnest started this quest to find something out or no I actually think I think so oh for was the panic attack and I think it was until oh eight that I encountered totally and then it was a year later that I got on meditation so only for the sake of time though I wish we could tell detailed the story how long until you took what I consider one of the most remarkable leaps to do a silent retreat a year but I want to be clear I often I rarely talk about the meditation retreat because I worry as somebody whose job it is to appeal to skeptics that the skeptic hears oh well this guy went on a meditation retreat I'm never gonna do that therefore I'm never gonna meditate so so in my world here's what I would say I routinely fast for seven days at a time but I don't expect any of my patients to do it and I don't think you have to do this I think you know one can do a whole bunch of other things that approximate 80% of that value so through the lens of we're not telling anybody that they have to go on a 7 day or 10 day or 14 day silent retreat though I'm infinitely curious and would like to talk about it you should yeah there are moments that I go back to remembering reading your book the first time and one of the most powerful parts of what you wrote about is something that occurred during that retreat so that that's sort of why I want to kind of dig into that there was something you wrote about that blew my mind and at the time I read it I couldn't understand what you were talking about and even though today I still have never experienced it I now can comprehend it which part it was like days five or six when you actually heard the wings of the bird flap again when you said that I was like he must be making that up or he was imagining that but I've had moments like when I do walking meditations which are great in your app by the way I'm gonna plug and protect all day long investors thing but I think Jeff Warren does a great guided walking meditation and I think I even talked about this with with

[01:14:20] Sam Harrison on that podcast it was the first time I noticed that when you walk you can actually feel the wind on your finger as your hand swings forward never how could I have ever I remember thinking myself how have I been walking all this time and never feeling that and then the sounds you could start to pick up sometimes I would just do outdoor like I would do a morning meditation outside not walking but still and I couldn't believe the sounds you could pick up so at least now I'm at the where I can actually imagine what you're saying but then of course to him you know think well what would six days of silence produce so one how did you decide to take that leap of faith and did you view that as more part of your personal development or part of your professional I'm gonna take this story to its most extreme conclusion both but a big dose of the latter I think that should be comforting so the listener who's thinking you know maybe I'll do this maybe I'll do a couple minutes yeah you are to to meditation what I kind of feel like I am to fasting which is it's my job to sort of see what the boundaries are so that a nobody has to go past them and be I have a better view of what the landscape is I that's a pretty good cop so there were two people who were really influential in terms of getting me to do this one was both of whom we've come up mark Epstein and

[01:15:38] Joseph and no actually didn't know Joseph yet oh that's right Joseph was the teacher there's a teacher and then Sam Harris yes so Sam I met Sam Harris prominent atheist writer and just before he had a podcast and before he had a meditation app and he was best known at this point just as a guy who wrote a book narrated or you narrated your moderated a moderated debate between him in a couple of people but one of the people on the other side was Deepak Chopra and Sam kind of tore him up Beck doesn't even seem like a fight by the way it was like

[01:16:07] I don't know Deepak but I know Sam so well and just knowing the caricature of Deepak like that strikes me as a little baby seal laying there and and the guy with a club like it was tough night for debug and I say that with affection because he's a really win Qi if you meet him he's a really hard guy not to like he's a very likable guy but Sam is amazing too and I spent some I admit Sam once before but Sam and his wife Annika who have also friends with know we're backstage at this event and I was chatting with them and they're so so impressive both and I mentioned that I was meditating and to my great surprise there were both avid active meditators at sama this whole long history of having spent a bunch of time in his 20s meditating and in that time he became friends with this eminent meditation teacher by the name of Joseph Goldstein who happens also to be the teacher of mark Epstein so I knew who Joseph was but I hadn't met him and but I knew that mark considered

[01:17:05] Joseph to be his teacher and Sam was saying hey you should go on a meditation retreat and Mark had been telling me the same thing and I was like this guy says I should do it and mark saying I should do it and they're both talking about Joseph Goldstein I should do it and so Sam as he said toyed with the laws of karma and got me into a Joseph Goldstein retreat which was a very hard thing to do and I will off I went without a lot of prep and with quite a bit of trepidation because I thought it was gonna be a bunch of weird people doing a shitload of meditation which I really didn't want to do I mean I think I was up to like 10 20 minutes a day or at this point I wasn't doing that much the idea of doing it like 5:30 in the morning until 10:00 at night just struck me as super daunting it was in Marin where is it Marin County of course and vegetarian food and blah blah blah I was just no I was a dedicated cheeseburger eater and you know being away from my wife I didn't have a kid at the time but like there's nothing it seemed like the shittiest summer vacation I could imagine and it was it was all of those things you know I get there and it's like I thought my I think I wrote in the book that I thought my roommate was gonna be wavy gravy but that it turned out I didn't have a roommate but it was a bunch of you know faded hippies and weirdos and you know at least this is what my judging mind was there actually lovely people I've met a lot of that become friends with some of them but my mind was on overdrive like these are all

[01:18:29] NPR you know socks and sandals folks and and that meditation itself was just awful just awful like sitting there all [ __ ] day you know I was in pain I mean I don't sit I don't twist myself into a pretzel I sit in a chair but that hurts and the walking meditation I'd never done that before I don't know what

[01:18:48] I was doing I just hated it I was just all over the place I didn't feel like I was getting anywhere and by day four or five I was gonna go I was ready to quit I was a tender it was ten days and I went to a teacher actually a teacher I didn't like but she was the only one I was available just because you you have this sort of ten minute window each day when you can potentially speak with a teacher one-on-one yeah but you would like they give you a time so I was gonna see

[01:19:15] Joseph every other day sometimes in a group setting with like three or four people and then sometimes one-on-one but I didn't have a time with Joseph this day and this is the day I was gonna quit and one of his assistant teachers who I had made all these judgments about spring washroom she was the only one I could sign up to see so

[01:19:33] I've to begrudging leeuwin and sauce spring who I thought was like the embodiment of all like everything I hated about meditation she talked in a really soft voice and had long flowing hair and wore shawls and spring saved my sorry ass what did she say she said you tried too hard like no no like Louie

[01:19:56] Louie lovey-dovey stuff you just listen to me whine for a little while like you're trying too hard don't try too hard just do you know notice your breath winds coming in and when it's going out when you get distracted start again don't you know you're gonna get distracted don't try to make anything special happen just stop trying to her I was like alright fine by the way Spring has gone on to become some of a very important figure in my life she is a extraordinary human being but I took her word for it and instead of sitting in the meditation hall I actually took my chair out of my room and pulled it onto the balcony outside of on the second floor of this building where the dorm where I was staying and I sat outside and I was like I'm not trying too hard just set down whatever happens happens and it was just like jus as soon as I stopped trying the whole thing unfurled for me and I was just so vividly present and mindful where I was just so quickly registering how speedy my senses are how

[01:21:03] I was going from hearing the rest of rustling of the leaves to the clanking of the pots in the kitchen which was down the hill to the footsteps in the hallway to the feeling of them a pain in my knee to an itch on my back just did it to a thought coming up sure this is how reality works it's this you start to see how fast things are going in your sensory life and that's really thrilling it's also accompanied by huge blast of serotonin and this breakthrough for lack of a less grandiose word lasted for like 36 hours where I just happiest

[01:21:40] I'd ever been I wept at one point which is a quite a rare thing for me I'm not super emotional it gave me an enormous amount of faith that there is so much to this practice and there's such a power to actually doing it in a container where that's all you have to do your meals are cooked for you you don't have your phone the schedule is set for you all you have to do is get up and do the practice every day but the big asterisk is if you try too hard you will tangle yourself up in knots one of the classic hindrances to meditation is desire if you want it too hard you're gonna shoot yourself in the foot it's like a weird video game where the only way to move forward is to not want to move forward and that's a hard thing to do and the only way to get there for me is to surrender and you can't fake surrender I go into every retreat now thinking I'm surrendered I don't care I don't care what happens I'm just gonna sit here but I do care and my mind knows I care because it's but the desires in the produce of course I want break through to electric boogaloo you know I want like pajama jammy-jam I want the sequel to that breakthrough and I can't get it so but what happens is I sorry you got a good pajama jammy-jam laughs if you landed with you guys this is like we're the right age where I could like a certain joke and you know the reference what happens though is if

[01:23:06] I'm on the retreat long enough usually it's 10 11 days I cycle through the reproduction attempts and I get to a genuine surrender and it's like I can't fake it I gotta go through this process of trying to do this of trying to get somewhere and then is punching myself out do you feel like listening to you describe this it's almost like the matrix where and again I don't think you have to be on a retreat to experience this but there's a realization that neo has when he sees the matrix for what it is that he's separate from that and do you think that that's a reasonable analogy for this idea of real that your thoughts are not you yeah except for separation is a problem so the red pill of waking up and seeing that reality is not what you thought that works as a comp mm-hmm but in fact in actual reality there's no separation yeah so not to get into the biggest cliche of them all being one with the universe but how can you not be one with the universe think you're separate from the universe you're created from the same atoms from the original exploding stars you know you are nature we feel our lived experiences that we're looking out at the world fretfully from some vantage point that's separate from nature but like your animal body is obviously part of nature and the workings of your mind is part of nature and that's mind-blowing and mind-blowing just conceptually you might register it as I say those words but you can experience it viscerally on retreat and that is incredible so you get back from this retreat and I mean can one even draw a sort of a linearity around this and says look at end a silent retreat is the equivalent of three years of a daily 15-minute a day practice I mean I know the answer to that question is no but you see where

[01:25:15] I'm trying to go with this right which is are you leap frogging in your practice such that when you came back from that 10-day retreat even if you went back to sitting for 10 to 15 minutes a day you were able to quote-unquote do something better I don't know I feel like you're leapfrogging in your practice but I don't know if it shows up that prominently in your 10 minutes when you get home you know I'm saying you build up your capacity to concentrate here's that here's the lowest hanging fruit is one important thing in meditation is the capacity to stay present which is at your concentration we're concentrations a little hard the image that comes up for me is a furrowed brow hunched shoulders trying to concentrate but it's more like can you just be awake for an extended period of time with your capacity to stay undistracted and of course there will be distractions but your ability to be supple in the face of those also improves so you can stay on the on the object usually your breath longer and the distraction doesn't throw you as much so that's a skill that's gets built I think in a way on retreat that because it's such a bootcamp you're gonna build those muscles much more actively on retreat but then you also occasionally will have a peak experience not always and wanting to have one of course is again the hindrance but sometimes in my experience you'll have a peak experience and that shows you something that just like when you take drugs it's like it becomes a distant memory but it's still with you in a and

[01:26:53] I when I say drugs here I mean more plants I'm done much at all but you know a lot of folks who have my understanding is the way that works is that you have a peak experience in it it does stay with you in the the rest of your life so my experience I'm only speaking from an end of one here but my experience having had a few peak experiences it's not like every time I meditate that's coming to the table with me now it's more just that first of all I'm imbued with a much deeper faith or trust that this is a worthy endeavor and to it just it's in my mind stream that this that some of what I've seen and understood some distant echoes of that are still here when you think about how you meditate today when you think about the practice you did yesterday just say something to you yeah yeah you said before that mom often meditation is unpleasant which is same for me so I was actually happy to hear you say that cuz it really represents a wise perspective which is we said it before but it bears repeating meditation is not about what you're feeling right now it's just knowing what you're feeling so that your feelings don't own you but I will say that 10 years in again just speaking personally having done five or six retreats and having done a reasonable amount of daily sitting

[01:28:12] I'm now at a point where my concentration is good enough so the thing to know about concentration is that it often feels really good which is why people love TM because it is a concentration meditation you're using this mantra that you're getting really focused on it's less it's more focused on concentration that it is on mindfulness and so being able to stay awake and concentrate it on something feels really good and I find that my daily meditation actually is much more pleasant because there's like a body high associated with it it's called there's a word for it in the ancient language of Pali the word is Pt piti and it I think the grandiose translation is something like rapture but it really just means like all the kind of like body tingling and high that you can get from meditation and so that's just something to look forward to there's no schedule for when this shows up and even for me I don't always get it and wanting it guarantees that I won't get it but it does show up on occasion not infrequently and can make my daily sitting it's a nice to have you can't get too focused on it so maybe you're you're sort of answering the question that I was about to ask which is when you think about meditating 10 years ago versus today it's safe to say you still think about gerbils and wonder if your hair is okay and think about your abs is the biggest difference that you are much more quick to realize that and come back to whatever your object is yes and and my reaction to it is much warmer and this I think is when you start not the bigger difference and speed with which you recognize it or the lack of pissed off fitness that comes with it I think the latter is in my experience more important both are important so there's a mental acuity piece to that which is that your your your seat your catching the stretch distraction more quickly but if you're catching it and then self-flagellating you're it's the purpose yeah really does because you're you're teaching the mind that catching yourself getting distracted is gonna come with punishment so your sit in some ways like not incentivizing the mind to wake up but if you can train yourself to be like all right cut that welcome to the party distraction that's a much bomb your inner weather and I think that feeds on itself in a really positive way I'm not particularly good at this I catch myself lapsing into judgment all the time but I catch the judging faster and I overtime through various meditation techniques gotten better at just having a warmer reaction to my own peccadilloes what's the most difficult thing you've gone through personally and/or professionally in the last five years where and where

[01:31:04] I'm gonna go with this is I'm curious to how you have been able to take this remarkable training that you've done in the last decade and begin to apply it to difficult experiences which is you know where the proverbial rubber hits the road well three things are coming to mind yeah I'll say them and you just pick whichever ones you want to dig in on one was that my wife and I had a really serious fertility crisis ended well with a baby but that was really hard and we were really under the impression we're not gonna have a child which was very depressing she also got breast cancer both of these were much harder for her of course than they were for me but obviously you don't wanna see the person you love suffering and I or start to worry that they're not gonna be around anymore so that was obviously awful and then a much more personal selfish level

[01:31:59] I got a 360 review which I think I might have told you about once before we were recording mm-hmm so anybody who doesn't know what a 360 review is it's often used in a corporate context it's a way to measure performance of executives the way they do it is they talk to the executives peers subordinates and superiors so you get a holistic panoramic 360 view into this person's performance I began writing a book about compassion and the idea because my wife would suggested it she'd say well you know a good way to jumpstart the narrative would be to see what other people think you should do to work on in terms of kindness compassion and then my edit there were a bunch of people in the room when she said this and one of the people in the room was the editor of the book and she the editor said hello ever heard a 360 review and I had and I was like oh that's a good idea and so we found this

[01:32:53] Buddhist executive coach Jerry Colonna who were talking about before he's got this coaching firm and they do 360s but they do the colonoscopy version of 360s so often 360s are these like kind of data entry thing where you give people a questionnaire and they answer multiple choice questions in the you crunch the numbers and you see the data

[01:33:12] Jerry's firm does hour-long interviews with everybody if anonymous interviews with everybody in your orbit and then they write up a lengthy qualitative report with direct quotes anonymous blind quotes and in my case we made it even harder because we threw in people of my personal life and so they didn't want to just we didn't want it to just be a professional measurement we wanted to get us a holistic sense of how am I so my wife my brother my meditation teacher Joseph

[01:33:39] Goldstein and all these peers in total sixteen people that was a 41 page report we also added on a bunch of questions about where and when and how I'm an [ __ ] and it was devastating I thought this is this cute little narrative conceit for this book I'm working on and I got to read the 360 and it suggested I was well the way I took it it didn't say this but I took it as monstrously broken defective incurably selfish self-centered narcissist I just want to pause you for one second because I I did the exact same thing in 2015 it's uncanny how similar the experience is because it was everybody who worked for me my board like at the time I was running a non-profit so it was my board everyone who worked for me ten friends plus family I mean this was a tour de force and the it's as you were telling the story the only word I had in my mind was the word that described me which was never once written but it was the only thing that came out and it was monster yeah monster and that you the first thing you said was monstrous yeah I believe that's what the first me you said I rarely slip into overt depression

[01:34:57] I usually slip into covert depression which is a shortcut to rage this was one of the few times in my life I went into a over depression after I reviewed that thing I did not want to leave a dark room for days I was eviscerated by that report yeah that's the way I felt it was awful so how did you pick yourself up well for a while I thought but did you think I'm a fraud how could I write this book yes that's literally the word I was just been because I am writing the book I just am working on the chapter where I read it and fraud is a word I use because I was like clearly I'm pretending to the world that I'm mr. happiness and I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] how did I pick myself up well first I thought okay well I can't do this book because nobody can see this one thing that helped was my wife and I first of all Geri Kelowna does a lot of coaching so I said I read it and then I saw him that day and he said a bunch of things that were super helpful and we have an ongoing relationship so he's check I stuck him at least once a month often more one of the things he said was it was very Buddhist so you now see all this stuff I know we're gonna do is we're gonna love it we're not going to get into shame or anger or self-flagellation we're gonna be like alright this behavior was serving some sort of need that some sort of primordial need you had that was not particularly skillful we're gonna give it a hug and say you're no longer needed his pushing me away from shame and more toward interest like wow what's going on here why would I do that why would I be so snippy with my subordinates why would

[01:36:55] I be so snippy with my wife why would I be so self-centered that I ignore other people's needs well clearly instead of just going right instead of calling me a monster Jerry's like no clearly you you're following some old script here that must have served you at some point and putting it in that light was incredibly useful and then I'll say one other thing which is that my wife who

[01:37:19] I'm very close to my wife and a lot of us are close with our spouses or life partners but she's like a consigliere for me professionally so nothing leaves my desk in terms of what I write without her thoroughly reviewing it she's basically the uncredited co-author on both of the books I've written and is deeply involved in all the aesthetic choices having to do with my app and she's just my right hand that's actually not even a good way to put it because she has her own career so she's really just doing this out of the goodness of her heart but I wrote I often say to people and this is not this is like only kind of a joke I don't know what I think until she tells me what I think so one of the things we started you have any extra time she does now because I have you some help no Cherie

[01:38:08] III don't know how she would be great at this she's amazing but one of the things that she got me to do was she and I would rent conference rooms around New York City get out of our house get go to a conference room and sit there and read the report together and discuss it section by section and one of the things she got me to do was focus on the first 50 was a forty one page report for the first 15 pages were positive style and she got me to really focus on that and then we went through the negative stuff she was just like it's not as my first reading nobody was calling me a monster they were just really describing in unvarnished terms me at my worst so are you like me in that I think my report is about the same right it was the first maybe maybe it was a 50-50 mix of some really beautiful glowing positive things and then people who I know we're all like all care about me deeply including people who described horrible things I've done they loved me despite those things but do you just disproportionately naturally focus on the negatives I think we all do we evolutionarily we come by this honestly we had to have a negativity bias right for survival you know you want to have salience you go above and beyond the evolutionary playbook like I mean because I think I do I think I am if the evolutionary playbook is to wait at 70/30 I don't know why I think I've just adapted to 99 1 right well which sounds like you do is I don't have data it's a support and my assertion but yes

[01:39:41] I strongly believe I dwell in the neck it was actually one of the things that what I was doing for in the 360 and so it was incredibly useful that my wife take me by the scruff and say you know yeah I'm gonna you're gonna look at this positive stuff and then we're gonna look at the negative stuff and see if it's not as bad as you thought it was nobody's actually calling you a monster and yeah you did do some things that are really uncool but you can fix this and

[01:40:06] I'll tell you that one of the there were a couple of comments made to me by people in my life that really helped me get over it one was Joseph the aforementioned Joseph Goldstein read it and said with a laugh self-knowledge is always bad news Wow interesting so so counterintuitive right yep and then my brother Matt another consigliere prominent venture capitalists in New

[01:40:35] York City and amazing human he said two things that I thought were funny he said well first of all I'm sorry you had to read this second of all now you got a good book and for me as an inveterate show man which is another thing I was doing forward the 360 that was actually comforting to hear it's like alright I this is I actually probably can talk about this and it'll be useful for people it's actually useful for me to hear you say that you and I there's a huge overlap in the Venn diagram of our deficiencies and okay so

[01:41:09] I think there are a lot of people out there who are really selfish and have really made a bunch of bad news but there are reasons why we are like this and those can get untangled and we can work on it and not only will it be good for everybody for us and those in our orbit direct orbit but if we do this in public it could help countless people now I'm really energized to work on the book so this is an awesome example of pain that you can pause for a moment and realize you have some control over the outcome the other two examples you gave kind of differ in fertility and cancer you have a lot less control over I think it's safe to say I mean in the end biology is sort of a complex organism using either one of those whichever one you're more comfortable talking about how did your practice either prepare you for and/or allow you to suffer less through when she had breast cancer I found that in some ways I think I think she would agree with me he was actually really good for our relationship because I am not particularly well this is the story

[01:42:23] I had told myself was that I'm not particularly caring and nurturing and yet here we were in a situation where I really needed to be I needed to step up and I found that I really liked it after a double mastectomy she was in a lot of pain and I wanted to sleep next to her but I if I slept in the bed every time I moved it was gonna drive her crazy so it felt good to sleep on the floor next to her set the alarm for every three hours to make sure I got up and made sure she was ahead of her meds so that she didn't fall behind because she would have and being of use in that way felt really good not like I'm such a good person and there's a little bit of that too but it feels good to be of service to somebody who you love it feels good to be serve service to anybody frankly why it didn't actually come to you not selfishness self protective selfishness probably self-centeredness I had written a chapter in a book about it by this point so I kind of knew it I knew it you know but this was a very powerful example of it and also probably some of the dynamics of our relationship where she is very giving and loving and compassion and I'm not again this is the story but of course I am there's a great description of enlightenment in the

[01:43:38] Tibetan tradition which is a clearing away and a bringing forth and that you know that to me seems like a great definition of enlightenment so like I can clear a waste of my [ __ ] that it blocks me from being useful to other people and having a trying to find a better word than connection but here we go connection and I'm bringing forth of the parts of you that actually are good at that and so that I felt was an enlightening experience and that I was forced to do all that and I could see that in my mind these register this acts of service registered as pleasant and again there's science here there's a thing called the helpers hi you know when you give to charity the same regions your brain light up that are light up when you eat chocolate so this isn't new then it's not unique that's just a universal human thing that

[01:44:32] I happened is to stumble upon in this context in a powerful way so I don't want to minimize that because that's awesome but you could argue that all of those things could be experienced without being faced with a life-threatening disease the the part me that I'm most interested in is you are now faced with something that is there's a probability that is nonzero and it's higher than it was a month earlier they this woman who is clearly the best thing that's ever happened to you no offense

[01:45:07] I'm tagging could be gone so as I think about my own practice when I've dealt with really awful things that have confronted me it's this realization that we are suffering so much in our minds probably more than in reality and so much of that suffering is due to thought it's due to projection it's due to playing out scenarios that I mean if we're gonna be brutally honest with yourself we have no clue what's going to happen and yet so much of our suffering is drawn out by those projections how much of that was going on for you and how were you able to sort of tame that or maybe asked another way if all of this had happened in 2008 versus 2017 18 how would it have been different thanks for coming to mind and I don't know if either of them they're gonna answer the question or be useful in any way but one of them is that I think frankly I didn't think much about the fact that she could die partly I knew

[01:46:12] III had a pretty high level of confidence based on the original diagnosis that she was gonna be fine well maybe the fertility ones are better example then like where there must have been a moment when you thought wow we might not be able to have oh yeah so so in that moment where let's just say before any of this happened you think there's a 95% chance we're gonna have kids and now at some point you're thinking there's a 10% chance we're gonna have kids I'm making these numbers up of course at that moment when it's a 10% chance we're gonna have kids it's really easy to start the projection of oh my god are we going to adopt if so how where what but it's not going to be our kid blood like I mean I'm just I mean like I'm the author of that playbook like yeah that's like I could win a Nobel Prize in Literature for that type of nonsense thinking but the point

[01:47:02] I was really driving toward is that in neither case did I do a particularly good job at relaxing into the uncertainty maybe why that could potentially be useful to say or to hear is that there are limits to the practice and I am NOT enlightened I'm a chameau who started meditating 10 years ago and I'm good sometimes at applying the lessons and sometimes I'm not and I think when Bianca got sick I didn't really forthrightly look at the potential that she would die and I think that when we had the infertility I didn't really allow myself to fully engage with the fact that we might not have a kid and then we had a kid so sometimes I'm good at this stuff and sometimes I'm not how has your practice made you a better husband I mean maybe that's a better question for your wife but where do you think it shows up most in your relationship with her so I think it's it's really the moment-to-moment stuff so I well I didn't I don't think I wrestled on a grand level with the mortality or the fact that we were gonna be able to have a kid but my moment-to-moment basic blocking and tackling of being a human in a relationship is much better in other words the mindfulness helps me see when

[01:48:20] I'm over seven percentage of the time not always helps me see when I'm over about to be overtaken by anger or fear whatever irritation and I can let it pass I can feel the raw data of the anger which by the way feels really bad but I don't need to have the satisfying energetic release of saying something tart that's gonna get me in trouble and that is just create a much more seamless relationship now over time actually if you add on top of it because you can make a case I'm increasingly leaning toward this and mindfulness is just one piece of the overall Buddhist picture and that alone isn't enough like warmth friendliness compassion whatever you want to call it is also incredibly important and then they're also just like skills for better communication adding all of those things in which I'm now really starting to do as I work on this book just makes it even better so learning to be a better listener learning how to phrase my assertions in ways that are less provocative training up through meditation by my baseline level of friendliness an ability to lean in and give a [ __ ] is all super useful and by the way feels really good when you're doing it because that kind of emotional availability or what did you say before one of your three mechanisms were was rage I've set detachment detachment feels bad in my experience because you know there's a bunch of stuff you should be doing and you feel guilty about that it's just gonna feel it's not doesn't feel good in my experience so the actual leaning in feels better again I still do detachment rage and say I do all of that this is not you're not listening to a perfected human being how do you know it's just lowering the it's like a marginal improvement so yeah I would I think she would say that our day to day is much smoother I doubt she can recall the last time I raised my voice which I did do before this and yet I think she would still say there are times where she walks on eggshells she can just sense you're really pissed about so yes yeah but then I think all the other thing is over time my being easier to be around has allowed her to see that some of her walking on eggshells is her own stuff and she might not have gotten there if I was Robert

[01:50:44] Johnson all the time when you bring up Robert because I was just coming I was literally just it's amazing we can reach others minds here when you think about your son and you think about Robert Terry real who we've spoken about a little bit has this great expression which I'm gonna sort of butcher although the expression which I have written down

[01:51:01] I feel like it's gonna be the opening quote on this chapter in my book which is every man is a bridge spanning the trauma of his past the legacy of his future something to that effect so you're a bridge right and you could make the case that some of the traits you have developed have been in response to things that were learned from him or his influence on others and you like every man have a choice about whether you'll pass those on to your son I mean it seems to me like this practice is a big part though not exclusively the only part of it but a big part of trying to leave Robert back where he belongs and not let him come up to be a part of your son's life I think more and I'm stealing some of this from Jerry

[01:51:53] Valona I don't have a pat answer to this but what's on my mind is I think it's okay for Alexander to know that I have labels and then inner Robert Johnson and and inner you know Sammy from what makes Sammy run and all that stuff but I think he needs to see me being okay with it so that he is okay with all of it he's gonna have negative parts of his psyche and I think the trick is not to stamp that stuff out but to have a supple warm relationship with it I guess what I'm getting at is not to get all psychological analysis but I think a part of what Robert Johnson did when he smacked his kids around and and told you that if you touched his VCR I'm just gonna beat the [ __ ] out of you that's actually transmitting a shame to you yeah like there's a feeling of shame that comes to a child that's hit it's bullying yeah that's what it is bullying and the bullying is a transmission of shame and

[01:52:55] I think that's the part that has to be stopped yeah it's not about perfection it's about stopping shame yeah and you know that's how I think about it in my life is there were a whole bunch of things that shamed the hell out of me and I think of that as my single greatest purpose in life at this point is what do

[01:53:12] I have to do to make sure that none of my shame makes its way to my three kids if I can accomplish that and nothing else that's that's great if I can accomplish other things in life that's even better but I have to accomplish that in there I sort of feel that way and a big part of not transmitting shame for me is recognizing shame when it shows huh so I would challenge that slightly but again not slightly and lightly because I'm not sure I'm right about what I'm about to say which is that strikes me that so my dad and mom did not inject any shame into my life but mostly the outside world I had a very loving parents and they weren't perfect but very loving I don't I don't walk around resenting them for much if anything I think it's possible I could get to a place where really I'm not the source of any shame for him and nor is his mother and he's in a really loving home but the world is really tough for sure so I want it to be a two-part thing I want it to be that we are bottomless wells of love and affection and wisdom for him to the extent that were possible and that we show him that like you're gonna have lots of dark parts of your own personality it's unavoidable and you can be okay with that I think that I actually think that's a that's an even more eloquent way to explain what I'm what I'm suggesting but I I think all

[01:54:35] I'm arguing is that the home should not be that your parents you know there's a term they use for this right which is your circle of origin or something to that effect right family of our family of origin yeah your family of origin really isn't the place where you want the shame to come from now because you can't control the world like there will be bullies at schools there will be all this other bad stuff so yeah I think the way you've described it is even more sort of nuanced and probably more accurate I guess what I would say is my two cents is I think meditation has probably prevented you from transmitting some of your own shame which has been manifesting itself largely in very externally positive ways the successes you've had are in some ways driven I think by some of those attributes in other words your adaptations your mal adaptation have been very socially acceptable but at some point they leak out in the weakest common denominator which is generally to our family right at least that's been my experience and my Endicott like the people in my immediate professional orbit right the people who you can't fake it around for long enough right so the hotel Regina left us with a book at a podcast and an app that had been useful in other people's lives so it was like a maladaptive thing that had a positive impact on society but also some of the sort of not so pretty parts of my motivation stayed with me and manifested in my being stressed and snippy and rushed and impatient and ingredie and all that other stuff and now for future projects I got to do a better job of coming not from hotel Regina but from some other place and this gets to something that you you wrote about in 10 percent happier but I'm curious as to how you've evolved one of the big questions you're trying to answer in your journey as you've described it in that book is can a person be successful professionally if they give up that thrive that that's sort of somewhat negative insecurity that feeds us and

[01:56:38] I'll let the readers go through your thinking at the time circa 2014 five years later where are you on that particular issue especially as you've just described it right which is hotel Regina gave us a whole bunch of things that are externally and ostensibly very positive but it came at a little bit of a cost do you believe that one can be all positively valence twha thout the negative or does that negative need to exist first of all I don't think you're gonna make the negative go away and my in my experience I don't have a sense that I'm gonna just conquer all my demons just be operating out of a position of pure love maybe but I don't see that coming down the pike for me right now but I still think you can turn on the volume on the less wholesome motivations and turn up the volume on the more wholesome motivations such as you know being of service etcetera etcetera and the less wholesome one being like looking for attention and money and that's to say attention to money are all bad but if you if you're like really really totally focused on that to the exclusion of anything else I think it's probably maybe not the best is there a way in there that you can shift the ratios and still be successful I believe yes it may also require a little bit of a shifting of how you define success and I think in there I'm starting to form a thesis but

[01:58:09] I think I'm a little more nuanced in my view during 10% happier in the subsequent never-ending book tour I really was dogmatic about the fact that you're not gonna lose your edge you know look at all these professional athletes who meditate and c-suite executives and all this stuff you know and I believe that to a point but I think at my level of meditation where I have like taking it quite seriously after a while you start to change a little bit how you define success and so for example I recently went part-time here at ABC News and that was a big deal this is this year's announced a month ago yeah so I was anchoring both Nightline and the weekend edition of GMA now I've given up

[01:58:55] Nightline and I anchored the weekend edition of GMA I do my podcast which is owned by ABC News and I do a special investigative reporting for the network it's still a lot but it's part time and the rest of my time I'm working on the app and books that I mentioned how much I love you yeah thank you yeah a couple more times you know that was tricky because I was thinking like in some ways I'm dropping this dream I've had for 25 years of reaching the absolute top of TV news if you think about it I'm kind of a b-level guy

[01:59:30] I forgot I've been very successful but you know I'm not anchoring the evening news or I'm not the main anchor of Monday through Friday GMA I don't have a primetime cable show you know those are the folks who how many a level people exist at ABC and then NBC like each of the three networks have how many there was a day when Jennings and Brokaw and dan Rather were the three like the pinnacles yes of television we were talking about yes earlier you said you could walk down the street with Peter Jennings circa 2000 yes and you might as well been walking the street with Muhammad Ali or Michael

[02:00:05] George it was crazy crazy so rough back the back of the napkin so there are three main networks each one has a single evening news anchor and each of them has three morning anchors so that's 11 people and then three cable networks and I would say maybe each of them has four stars maybe true stars so that's 11 plus so 2025 yeah I II don't think I'm gonna be one of those 25 and by the way there's massive gradations within the 25 like I bet I wouldn't recognize 15 of those that's right would you recognize

[02:00:45] Anderson Cooper yeah amazing person who's really been helpful to me you would recognize George Stephanopoulos yep Diane Sawyer yep Sean Hannity yep would you recognize Joe Scarborough nope for the listener it's not that I'm a [ __ ] it's just I never watched television I can't actually recall the last time I've watched the television event there was not a Formula One race or a football game so we may have reached the end of the list yes so there might be five people on that list I would recognize if I saw them oh we saw a picture of Michael Strahan in the hallway and you recognized yes but that may it be from football yes I mean I knew him from the Giants but no but I remember I've seen him on TV just because when you're whenever you're in the gym that seems to be what their show and a lot of people who you might have recognized have got me too you know Matt

[02:01:32] Lauer Charlie Rose of course definitely my lot of Charlie Rose yeah but everybody would have recognized Jennings and rather in Brokaw what I was trying to say is that I've had to look if tomorrow when did you decide it was okay to get off the train in the last year Wow yes in the last year it's been a huge tow for me how was that a funeral for a piece of your ego did you have to bury that little piece I I don't think it's clean like that I think it's like you said to me on my podcast say you're a backslider mm-hm so like I had him I've had moments of realizing powerfully okay

[02:02:10] I'm letting this go but then I something triggers me and I start getting competitive and weird again and then I remember oh yeah I don't know I'm not playing this game anymore so that's pretty much how it goes for me I could spend a week or two out of the building you know working on other stuff and just not even remember I'm a TV news journalist unless somebody stops me on the street and then I get back in the building and one thing or another happens and I start filling in on GMA and I'm around I'm feeling it on weekday

[02:02:36] GMA and I'm around all these big hosts and you know four great relationships with these folks but I started thinking away I mean trying to do this I spent 25 years trying to do this and so it's it's not clean but the the overall trend is toward not my wife described it as like an app that was running that was sucking up a lot of my battery life but I wasn't using it so I think that's starting to happen in a pretty big way that doesn't mean I don't want to be in TV news I'm actually like here the app she's describing is the talk is this self talk right yes that's such a great I like that because right now I'm having this awful issue with my computer where Adobe is not working well and if I have it open it will take 50% of my battery in one hour so my new rule is I can't have any PDFs open when I'm on the airplane and I'm working off battery but that's that now forever I will be able to every time I open a PDF I'm gonna think about that and think hey what's my mental Adobe

[02:03:37] Reader right now just to close this out I still want to be and be news I just want to be in TV news in a way that's like really enjoyable which is I'm not constantly angling for the next job I'm just loving the one I have right now and trying to Ace this thing and that's just for me it's much more pleasant and doesn't mean I don't continue to have big ambitions have a startup company I would like us to be a billion dollar company

[02:04:00] Levi mention how great the app is that that company makes yes yes you have and I need billboards in Times Square with you giving this but you know one of our competitors is is a billion dollar company and do I think we can also be one I literally and I'm sorry to piss off all the comm users I don't think it belongs in the same sentence as your app well it's a different product it is a very so I'm sure the defenders of that product will say yes but it does a B and

[02:04:27] C which I guess I don't place a premium on but I guess for the things that I'm looking for I think yours and Sam's are kind of in their own world and I think as the market matures you'll see you'll create these niche lands yeah yeah and I think tom is helping a lot of people so I'm a terrible businessman in that I'm

[02:04:45] I'm a promoter of another price yes I am because I think if somebody comes to me and says they're using calm I'm happy using headspace I'm happy for them my view is I like ours better and I would put Sam's and I'm kind of obviously we're done for Sam yeah I think it's impossible to put a stake in the heart of all of your demons forever in my view speaking only for myself I don't imagine all of my inner hobgoblins evaporating permanently but I do think I can turn the volume down and operate out of a cooler space let me just give you an example we talked about safety before no remember how I noticed that Jerry

[02:05:22] Colonna has this thing about love safety and belonging info oh yes really he did not say needs for the job yeah and I realized that like it's not that my life is devoid of risk but I can make a pretty solid intellectual argument that if my startup goes pear-shaped and my current situation with ABC news doesn't work worst-case scenario professionally I still be fine and can I operate day to day from the place of feeling already safe and how will that change how

[02:05:56] I show up it means that I don't go I'm not so sweaty and super heated in meetings everything isn't so stakes the stakes aren't so high I can operate from a much more relaxed place and I found that experimenting with this which is a bit of a leap of faith has really changed the way I show up now how do we extrapolate that to somebody who works at Walmart and every day they wake up and think is Amazon going to close this

[02:06:23] Walmart so it's one thing to be dan Harris who I would agree with your assessment if ABC fired you tomorrow and the app blew up I agree with your assessment I just think you're gonna be fine like I don't see any scenario under which you're not fine but I don't know if I can say that about that person and given that that person is not rare there's not 17 people in the United

[02:06:50] States that feel that way or that are in that experience and by the way I feel much more like the Walmart person than you it's like I feel way more insecure about my existence so I'm asking this in many ways through a very selfish lens how do we do this if we're not where you are yet I think it's an excellent truly excellent question there's a massive amount of privilege associated with what

[02:07:13] I just said I don't think there's any way around it we have to view this step out of the spiritual for a second and into step out of psychological and into socio-economic he's a very easy thing for a white male wealthy highly educated quasi public figure to say all the [ __ ] I just said as opposed to a Walmart worker never mind if it's a trans person or a woman of color who happens to work at Walmart I just don't think there's any way around that I do think it applies to you I mean you are going to be fine with the exception of the white part although you present as white you have all of the privilege that I have unless

[02:08:00] I'm missing something yes no I'm not suggesting I don't I think I'm just suggesting I don't feel it right i feei still feel tremendous insecurity of everything could be taken away tomorrow I think if there was a better meditation practitioner and teacher in the room right now she or he would have an answer to how we can all feel safe no matter what our circumstances are I just am NOT that person we're bumping up against the limits of my abilities and you know you said something earlier that I think is really important as I've been struggling with this chapter in my book on emotional health you know right now it has sort of three pillars and I suspect it will evolve the three pillars are mindfulness developing the capacity to be mindful developing the capacity to reframe things which is basically stoicism and then some and also cognitive behavioral therapy correct and then the third pillar is relationality and you've basically said all three of those in your own terminology so that makes me feel better that I'm not on the wrong track it might be that mindfulness is not per se the tool for that that one particular insecurity or maybe it is to some extent but the one thing that I do that does give me comfort when I feel very insecure is if I lose the capacity to do my work tomorrow I don't lose my relationships that's not really me falling back on a mindfulness tool it's me falling back on it's a reframe it's basically a reframe that says you know what if I had to give up all of the things that I loved in life and if I couldn't do what I do but I still had these people in my life

[02:09:58] I'm not gonna kid myself and say my life would be just as good but it wouldn't be all bad and that's probably the closest I can come at this point to thinking about to be clear I I think I have so much evolution that still has to come because I'd love to get to the point where I could show up from a place of zero insecurity let me just stop you on that because I hope you die didn't miscommunicate that I gave anybody the impression that

[02:10:26] I show up with zero fear and insecurity it's just that I'm experimenting with recognizing that I don't have it there's no rationale for it there is limited rations you know and that I can go into today's meetings from a feeling of like let's just enjoy this I can't believe I get to have all these meetings today about this amazing company or this amazing story I'm gonna work on and can

[02:10:49] I not be so clenched up because that's not helping the process or the end result that doesn't mean risk isn't out there and it doesn't mean I'm getting to zero on my demons just means that I'm turning down the volume and that's the 10% happier spirit which is there is no magic it's really about marginal improvement over time with an escape valve for backslider because that's just

[02:11:15] I think my understanding of how human behavior works based on an end of one but I think it's a pretty universal I think we're all kind of being the same bucket in some ways I'll bring up another point that you brought up something earlier and this is sort of a bit tangential but I think it is really important which is one of my therapist's

[02:11:34] I know you got a kick out of the fact that I've really not a type-a way in moderation except moderation okay that's my type a way to do so but one of them made a really great point which was the importance of my daughter who's again I think you commented on the age gap between my kids but different very different relationship with my daughter than my son the eleventh yeah right is one who's almost 11 and then there's the faith of five in the two and I was talking about something that I was very uncomfortable about something I was very ashamed of and the therapist said that's funny I'm even blanking on which one it was either Terry or Esther but it was

[02:12:22] Esther she said it's actually very important that your daughter sees how much you're ashamed of this and how much you're struggling with this and it's okay if she sees you cry about this and and she really went through all this stuff and in retrospect it seems so obvious that what she was really trying to say was you're not helping her by letting her think you're some indestructible force who's not who never struggles who doesn't have remorse who doesn't make mistakes and then come to repent and as obvious as that sounds now that has historically felt wrong like it's i felt like she should see me as perfect and and i should hide my mistakes from her i think what made me think of that was just something you you said earlier about your son but you just said it so much more eloquently right which is you want him to see your struggle you want him to know that boy daddy's knee-jerk reaction is to lose his mind right now over whatever but

[02:13:24] I've like figured out this whole practice and I'm just less likely to lose my mind now and whatever it is that's sort of pissing me off that used to piss me off for four hours is actually going to upset me for about two minutes this is actually something I'm really looking forward to in life is just as I feel like I'm right in the midst of finally starting to win the battle there is actually sharing that with my kids my daughter is old enough to remember some of these outbursts she has seen some brutal outbursts she has never been the recipient of an outburst but she has she's been in the car when I have I mean uttered such profanity at another driver that you just and there's no way she's not traumatized by that there's no even though you know because

[02:14:11] I don't know thing I've learned about children is at that age they can't sometimes tell that it's not about them yeah it's it seems irrational to us no I'm clearly yelling at a person in a car who nearly killed us how could she take that personally but you know on some level she's pierced by that yes so for her to understand that your dad's flawed and he's trying to be less flawed I think if this is like one of the greatest things that we could do as parents yeah because she's gonna have flaws and how she gonna relate to them yeah and that's that's what that's that that's the key see yeah that's the part that you're adding to it that I don't think I've thought through stealing it from Jerry Kelowna so I think it's incredibly potent you are modeling successful relationships with your own complexity and own demons to your kid that uh not only enriches your behavior and relationship with the kid because they really know you but it also just gives them a tool for moving through life in a way that will reduce their own suffering was the last time you saw Peter Jennings before he died he called me into his office down the hall here and told me he wanted me to go to off on a trip to the Middle East he spent some time in Israel and then go into Iraq and then also told me that there was a perception I wasn't very good at foreign coverage well but this was before he told the world he was dying right yes I know this is just typical of him he was like giving me this big assignment and also like smacking me in the face while he did it just it's like a little pointed jab at ya you need to prove to us once again that you're good at this thing even though I had like spent years getting shot at and then when I was on that trip he announced that he had lung cancer this was oh five oh five yes that was in like late winter early spring of oh five and then I didn't see him again he called me one time in the spring and he could barely talk his voice the the cancer had shredded his vocal cords camera board he was telling me he was kind of like correcting something I had done that's how he operated he was very into correcting and so we talked and then that was it and then I heard he died in August but you didn't see him in that interim you never came to visit him no was he not the kind of person that would want to have been visited uh or did you not feel close enough the in person you know our relationship

[02:16:49] I was certainly one of his mentees and he really took that very seriously he really took me under his wing I don't know if he was receiving visitors but I don't think even if he was I would have been somebody would have had to cajole or invite me because you just wouldn't have been comfortable in that setting I wouldn't presume that he wanted to see me so Peter died young he was in his sixties yeah 66 yeah so if you could go back in time to the late 90s where you met him in what the late 2001 2000 so you can go back in time to then when he say call it 60 but you are the guy you are today so you're still younger than him but you're close enough right but you know these things that you've learned and you were having dinner with him and you know all this stuff about him right which is like he's this maniacal perfectionist he is the best of the best would you be probing these things would you want to know if he was happy do you think he was happy I think he could be happy but I think fundamentally he seemed to me like somebody wasn't super happy and I think he was driven a lot by the dark spots you know the wanting to prove wanting to win and yet he also that dysfunctional part of him created so much value and that he was just so such an intrepid reporter and he also trained you know like we learned so much by being near him and so there's so many journalists who are working today because and or do a better job because of their relationship with Peter I'm very reluctant to push meditation on anybody so I thought that's that's where you were going with it but simply to probe his happiness level and what might be contributing to unhappiness yeah I do think I would have done that I actually think that could have been interesting and productive if I had evangelized meditation to him I think that probably would have backfired I can't say one way or the other but just as a general rule

[02:19:02] I think even as I think about talking with some of my patients who have that phenotype usually meditation isn't the place to start the place to start is just to try to get a sense of the similarities between us I'm not talking to anybody about this stuff is an authority who's figured anything out I'm talking about it as a schlep who's right there whereas a lot of times when doctors talk to patients there's this view of all the doctors over here and the doctors figured it out and they've got a couple of stone pillars that are carved with instructions and there's given to you but this is clearly an area where that's not the case and maybe even using Peter as an example which of course is just such ridiculous speculation so I just want to caveat all of that you've pointed out that one he was arguably the single best that ever did this job two he spawned a generation of people like you who have been imparted with a standard of professionalism Anderson

[02:20:00] Cooper Jake Tapper Chris Cuomo John Berman Bob Woodruff Martha Raddatz George Stephanopoulos I mean Jonathan Karl like on and on just Pierre Thomas just incredible people who came out of his orbit so it begs the question that we've sort of danced around if Peter was a Buddha Zen dude could he have had that same impact or would it have simply been a different impact for which it's impossible to speculate what the net ripple effect was my intuition is that you're gonna have more of an impact on people if you're not stressing them out so much that all they can that they you shut down their ability for for cognitive function because that's what he did he was just so was such a bully that you know when you stress somebody oh you they they can't learn well but if he felt safe and was willing to sort of calmly impart the many lessons he had learned over the course of his illustrious career I think we would have learned even more instead one of the things we learned was how to deal with a bully hmm Dan there is so much more I'd love to talk with you about but I think we should save it until your book is in its next phase which is to say about to come out talk to us about what that timeline looks like so you're you're in the throes of writing and still storyboarding writing actually writing mostly storyboarded it's it's mostly storyboarded it's going slowly but I hope it will come out early make him a close to when yours comes out early 2021 okay or mid 2021 we'll see I mean the absolute absolute best-case scenario which i think is highly unlikely would be New Year's 2021 a more likely who'd be some point in that year got it I can't believe we might have to wait that long to talk again so maybe we won't but nevertheless no we're gonna work out together well no no I mean talk about talking about oh yeah well thank you so much I mean thank you on several levels right thank you for 10 percent happier just completely on a personal level I'm simply not sure if that door could have been pried open with any other tool and that door had to be pried open and even though it is it's simply the beginning of a journey I think it is one of the most important journeys I've ever taken and will continue to take and just thank you for creating an app that I think takes something like meditation that comes with so many hang-ups and so much baggage and makes it so completely accessible and again I'm biased but it's the type of meditation and the type of practice that on a personal level I have found most helpful to alleviate my abject misery and suffering that seems to be my default state so thank you for that and lastly just thank you for making so much time thank you you can find all of this information and more at
