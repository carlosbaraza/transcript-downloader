This clip is from episode 345 ‒ Chronic pain: pathways, treatment, and the path to physical and psychological recovery

In this clip, they discuss:

- Why We Admire High Pain Tolerance – Society tends to view stoicism as strength, even in medical settings
- The Hidden Cost of That Bias – People with lower pain tolerance may be unfairly judged
-  Pain Sensitivity Is Modality-Specific – Tolerance to cold doesn’t always mean tolerance to heat, pressure, or chronic pain
- Chronic Pain Outcomes Are Predictable—Sort Of – Traits like catastrophizing, depression, and inflammation impact who struggles most
- The Amplifier Effect – The nervous system can turn up or down the volume on pain—some brains are simply wired louder

## AI Summary

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode segment focuses on pain tolerance and its societal implications, featuring Dr. Sean Mackey. The discussion explores how society tends to value high pain tolerance while potentially stigmatizing those with lower tolerance. The conversation delves into the complexity of pain perception, highlighting that pain sensitivity can be modality-specific (e.g., different tolerances for heat versus cold) and that experimental pain responses may not predict chronic pain experiences.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Pain tolerance varies by modality (heat, cold, pressure, etc.) [00:04:00]
- Genetic factors influence pain tolerance [00:04:00]
- Experimental pain protocols don't necessarily predict chronic pain responses [00:04:00]
- Diabetic neuropathic pain strongly correlates with glucose control [00:06:48]
- Peripheral sensitization occurs with inflammation [00:07:25]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Maintain good glucose control for preventing diabetic neuropathy [00:06:48]
- Consider inflammation's role in pain sensitivity [00:07:25]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Athletes should develop pain management strategies that extend beyond their active careers [00:05:48]

4. **Factors Affecting Pain Experience**:
- Self-efficacy levels [00:05:48]
- Presence of depression, anger, anxiety [00:05:48]
- Catastrophizing tendency [00:05:48]
- Sleep quality [00:06:48]
- Exercise status [00:06:48]
- Insulin resistance [00:06:48]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Society rewards it [high pain tolerance]. And yet by definition a significant subset of the population... are going to be a standard deviation on the other side" [00:02:58]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- How can medical professionals better address pain management for patients with naturally lower pain tolerances?
- What role does genetics play in pain tolerance across different modalities?
- How can we better predict chronic pain development from acute injuries?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Don't we as a society just tend to look more favorably at people that have a very high pain tolerance? So when you go through that experiment you just did with the medical students. If everybody's being brutally honest, aren't they kind of looking at the people who score 012 more favorably than those that score 8 n and 10?

[00:00:18] Absolutely. Why do you think that is? Because if I'm being truthful, I do it. Yeah. Yeah. That's what society values. That's that was my home life growing up. That's what my father expected. I come from a very working class. You know, my father had 12 brothers and sisters fighting for whatever scraps of food and he brought that into my world, our world as kids, and you just suck it up and deal with it. And my father had back pain later in life and he would never talk about it, would never ask my opinion. and when I offered my opinion, he would never follow it. Had bad consequences in the end. But we value that. That is just the way our our society is. Is that a male thing exclusively?

[00:01:10] I think you need to get some women on the show and ask them. Um I think I think it crosses actually. I do think there is a masculinity aspects of that and I think I could be wrong here. I think that that thing is also attractive for women. I think there's a certain attractiveness because that person may be more likely to be a good provider than somebody who is weak and uh sensitive, but you know, we're getting a little out of my wheelhouse on that. But you're you're you're absolutely right. I I just think it's like a compatibility thing. Like I know when I do that type of an exercise compared to others, I tend to just feel less pain. I also know my wife does as well. Yeah. And and so I almost wonder if that's a compatibility. Like we both just have a high threshold for that when we're exercising, when we're doing anything, even recreationally that doesn't matter. my uh partner, my fiance, we're now engaged, um is a professor at Stanford, Beth Darnell, and uh she's an ex- ultramarathon runner. And I've always admired the fact that she can sit there in front of a computer or work on something untold hours and not move. And I I'd ask her like and she's just like, "Listen, I was really good with running with a pebble in my shoe, putting one foot after another and just working my way through it." And I similarly grew up in an environment where, you know, you learn to be tough and you learn to power through life's adversities. So what is the consequence of this? So we're acknowledging that it is an attractive trait to have a high tolerance of pain.

[00:02:58] Yeah. Society rewards it. And yet by definition a significant subset of the per of the population, call it a third, call it a quarter if it's a normally distributed function, yeah, are going to be a standard deviation on the other side, right? They're going to be in the they're going to be on the side where hey, they're relative to people who have a high tolerance for pain, these are people going to really perceive pain.

[00:03:22] And if we just did this through the lens of the responsibility of the medical community, there's a pretty significant consequence to that, right? Indeed. Now, as with all things, it gets a little bit more nuanced. We talked about cold, for instance. It turns out that some of the sensitivities are modality specific. Uh, so just because you have a high threshold for cold, you could completely flip it on hot or pressure or pin prick or whatever the other modality is. As somebody who runs a paint lab, I've had everything done to me imaginable. I take heat really well. My son Ian takes heat really well.

[00:04:00] Uh, I've had, you know, these thermal devices on me where I've been there and ended up with secondderee burns um define my seven out of 10. I hate the cold. I hate the cold. I'm a I'm a wuss when it comes to the cold. It's why I live in California. Uh, it's why I lived in Arizona. Um, I think there are genetic aspects of this. So, we have to be mindful modality specific. On top of it, these experimental protocols probably have little bearing on somebody's experience of chronic pain. I was going to say, is there any way to put together a set of experimental lab versions of this to basically generate predictive models of how people will respond to real world pain? And I was I think where you're going with chronic pain is even more relevant, right? So for example, why do some people have a disc herniation that leads to, you know, manageable pain whereas for others the exact same injury by every metric available to us produces a totally different set of consequences and what do we do about that? And because this is now where we move out of that dicardian model, we appreciate the role of the brain and its modulatory capacity, its ability to turn the amplifier down. And so if you're thinking about a stereo amplifier, we talked about how some people to a certain stimulus might be uh a zero or one on the dial. Some might be a 10. But what we didn't talk about are people's capacity to now manage their pain, cope with their pain, their level of self-efficacy around their pain.

[00:05:48] Um, athletes learn how to manage their pain and suffering. Um, where they run into problems is when the sports are over. They're retired. That's when I see them. So there are many factors that predict how well somebody is going to do with chronic pain. They align with a lot of the stuff in your book. So you know there's the level of a person's self-efficacy plays a role. There is the presence or absence of whether they've got underlying depression, anger, anxiety, something called catastrophizing. Terrible word, very important concept. probably one of the most predictive of uh amplified pain. What about other things? You talked about sleep deprivation. Any other physical things? Exercising, not exercising, uh insulin resistance, non-insulin resistance type like what are the other things that might factor into this? Yes.

[00:06:48] Yes. Yes. One of the biggest predictors of diabetic neuropathic pain is glucose control. So you know one of the first things we do if we have a person with diabetic neuropathy which the diabetes the high blood sugar as you know much better than I um causes injury to those no susceptive fibers and also uh causes injury to the a beta inhibitory fibers and so we that correlates with glucose control by way of example uh diet plays a role uh because if you're eating things that are causing inflammation

[00:07:25] We didn't talk about all of the stuff that amplifies or winds up those peripheral noiceptors. We treated those as a static thing when they're not. They're dynamic. So in the face of uh of inflammation um that causes something called peripheral sensitization. You've turned up the amplifier on that noisceptor in the periphery.
