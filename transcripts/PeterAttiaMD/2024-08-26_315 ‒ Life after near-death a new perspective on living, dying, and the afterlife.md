## Transcript

[00:00:00] and so I thought what about what about now I stopped going to front lines but then I went to the ultimate front line which is my own death my own mortality this thing we all face and that almost all of us fear I was allowed to go to the precipice look over the edge and then allowed to come back did I come back with any sacred knowledge in other words any knowledge that will help me or other people live with more dignity less fear more connection more love etc etc that's that's the task hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:40] AA Sebastian thanks so much for coming to Austin it's uh it's great to finally meet you in person having You Know spoken with you and emailed you many times over the past few years and spoken with you obviously on a previous podcast um th this book is is really a fantastic book it's hard to describe um the experience of of reading it it's um I think it's it's it's so beautiful it can almost bring you to tears in certain sections because um you know there are the stories within it that that sort of tell us about our mortality um but I also think there's something so beautiful about it which I'm I'm curious if others have explained to you their reaction which is you can feel so incredibly insignificant reading this which is actually kind of a nice thing it it makes it makes this whole thing seem a little less scary and by this whole thing I mean death well our insignificance in the cosmos does sort of take the pressure off right like um we don't mean anything and that's um that's terrifying and kind of liberating I mean it's sort of both and one of the things I talk about in the book is a kind of um reverence for life and I think it's quite hard to find one's way in the busyness of daily life in modern our modern society it's quite find hard to find your way to that reverence um it was for me without having been terrified once I was terrified by almost dying the flip side of that Terror was reverence and I found it quite easily after that and so for me you know at one point after my um near-death experience I had a lot of psychological struggles you know we can talk about that but um at one point my wife said to me

[00:02:34] Sebastian do you feel lucky or or unlucky that you almost died I mean not that you survived of course you're lucky but that that it happened at all yeah like could if you could go back and push a button have it not happen would you push that button and I didn't um I honestly didn't know how to answer um was I blessed or cursed and the psychological consequences of almost dying and what I saw on the threshold what I remember from the threshold they were frankly so devastating that I absolutely felt cursed and then I um in struggling to answer I I track down the origin of the word blessing now I'm an atheist but I feel that there are secular um meanings to words beautiful words like blessing or sacred that we atheists are free to use and um and so I track down the origin of the word blessing and it comes from the

[00:03:32] Anglo-Saxon Blan which means blood and the idea the idea being that there is no blessing without a a wounding without a sacrifice um and and maybe there's no wounding without a blessing and that battlefields are sacred because blood has been shed childbirth is sacred because blood has been shed in pre-christian

[00:03:55] Europe often animals were were sacrificed on holy days to bless um to bless fields to bless buildings to bless people and and so that that that the twinning of blessing and and wounding um uh were that that really they're the same they're aspects of the same thing and when I when I realized that it it allowed me to make this sort of psychological step an important psychological step where I stopped feeling sort of cursed by too much knowledge that I'd somehow gotten too much knowledge on the threshold of death and couldn't continue daily life with that knowledge it was too burdensome it was too scary it was too true and once I read the origin of the word blessing I like oh I'm free I'm it's both how wonderful and that really did sort of

[00:04:43] Release Me From This existential um conundrum that I was in I think it's probably worth telling listeners if they haven't already read the book or even heard you on another podcast where you've um described the story of what happened in uh June of 2020 in fact you and I actually discussed it a little bit I believe on our last podcast but again maybe just to make sure everybody knows what we're talking about Visa your experience um do you want to kind of recount this the story in in enough detail that people will understand the the technical aspects of what happened and and basically how how much luck played a role in you sitting here today yeah um I'm I'm happy to so last night uh at my book reading at book people in

[00:05:36] Austin um uh yesterday was June 16 and I was able to because of the time difference Etc with the East Coast I was able to say to the audience this moment right now this moment exactly four years ago I started dying it was exactly the time and um so I was it was during it was during covid I was living with my family at the time a three-year-old girl and a six-month old girl My Little daughters and my wife Barbara we are living in a in an old house in a remote part of

[00:06:12] Massachusetts at the end of a dead end dirt road um deep in the woods no cell phone service landline landlines that would would short out when it rained and often didn't work and um in other words Paradise right and um we were there during covid and I you know I I was in my you in my 50s uh a lifelong athlete um in extremely good health strong like never never thought twice about emergency transport to a hospital why would I I'm I'm not a walking heart attack I don't have high cholesterol you know etc etc I know we all age and we can get cancer and things like that but you know the the idea I I didn't think I had anything that would drop a middle-aged man in his tracks right and um who knew so one afternoon the the the uh some neighbors down the road called the family that we knew and the teenage girls offered to come over and babysit and uh you know that was a rare opportunity like we so we jumped on it they came the girls came over to babysit our our our little girls and um my wife and I went off to a cabin that's even deeper in the woods and an even more beautiful spot and and uh completely cut off from everything and down a trail and we were we were able to spend a couple of hours there and um thank God we did that I didn't go running or was something that would have put me even more uh Off the Grid because I would have died had that happened we were in this cabin and in mids sentence in mid-sentence I felt this sort of stab of pain in my abdomen it wasn't unbearable but it was it really got my attention and it wouldn't go away unlike indigest you know some digestive pain you know it just wouldn't nothing would ease it and I finally stood up to sort of walk walk it out and um and the floor went reeling away from me and I almost fell over and I sat back down and

[00:08:06] I said words I never thought I'd have to say I said honey I think I'm going to need help uh I've never felt anything like this and um she sort of half dragged me out of the cabin and down the trail and we made it to the dirt driveway and she put me in the passenger seat of the car and ran in to tell the um the babysitters like try to call the ambulance Seb something's wrong with

[00:08:32] Sebastian and I um you know I'm sitting there in the car and now I start going blind um this the sky turns electric white and that the electric white takes over the trees and the house and everything around me and um I didn't I didn't know it but I was in and out of Consciousness uh and um these were all the symptoms of catastrophic blood loss

[00:08:56] So what had happened was I had an an aneurysm an unnatural ballooning at one spot in my pancreatic artery which is this little artery that almost no one ever needs to think about and I had an aneurysm in this thing which is really quite rare and it was the result of having a sort of a ligament sort of in the wrong place in my abdomen that occluded my Celiac artery it's all sort of rather complicated but basically the

[00:09:22] Celiac is this garden hose and when you if you cut it off with this ligament in the wrong place the blood has to flow somewhere else and it flows through these smaller arteries and if one of them has a weak spot or a vulnerability that weak spot will balloon and the the the the bubble will get bigger and bigger and the arterial wall will get thinner and thinner and it can rupture and if it ruptures you're now bleeding out into your own body into your own abdomen if someone would just had done you the favor of stabbing you in the stomach when they got you to the hospital the doctors would know where to put their finger to stop the bleed right in some ways it's an easier proposition but with internal hemorrhage it can be quite hard to find the location I mean to the to the Layman your abdomen is just a big bowl of spaghetti like where do you even start looking and how do you get how do you get in there and so I didn't know all of this but I I my an I had an undiagnosed aneurysm that had been growing probably for decades and um it had finally ruptured in that moment and uh I was losing a pint of blood probably every 10 or 15 minutes into my abdomen and um there's 10 units of blood in the human body thereabouts and you can lose maybe two-thirds of it before you sort of cross over to territory where it's really hard to come back from even if you're transfused and um and I and we lived a 1 hour drive from the nearest hospital so I was literally a human hourglass and the ambulance finally came and um off we went and I had sort of rebooted a bit um I went into compensatory shock which makes you feel a little bit a little bit better for a little while and an hour later we pulled into the hospital and I went out of compensatory shock right then into end stage hemorrhagic shock deeply hypothermic um not of right mind and actively dying and would probably have been dead in the next 10 or 15 minutes had I not been in an ER at that moment and they rushed me into the trauma Bay and started trying to save my life yeah

[00:11:31] I'll just I'll share an interesting anecdote from my days in the trauma center at John's Hopkins which is that um time to hospital uh and and more specifically time to either surgery or IR Interventional Radiology which is where your life was saved is the single most important metric and there's an amazing guy named Eddie Cornwell who was at the time the chief of trauma surgery at

[00:11:56] Hopkins um who wanted to test this because of an interesting observation he had made which was when he was um trauma surgeon in Los Angeles um he noticed that the gangbangers who were brought in by their buddies were surviving at a slightly higher rate than those that were brought in by ambulance this is very counterintuitive right so this is you know this is the this is all penetrating trauma it's what we called the knife and gun club and when a guy got shot or stabbed and his buddies drove him to the ER and dropped him off and took off cuz obviously everyone's in the wrong here right um those guys had a better chance of surviving than the guy who got brought in by the ambulance with the IV fluids running in him and brought in and so what what Eddie and his colleagues uh postulated was what could possibly be better about being thrown in the back of a truck than being in the ambulance and he realized well technically those guys are getting to us sooner because no one's putting an IV in them no one's checking their Vital Signs no one's doing anything else and so they did an experiment where uh and it's kind of a crazy experiment where depending on the day of the week all ambulances were uh were going to basically randomize the trauma victims to either business as usual which means when a penetrating trauma victim is found you do everything that you would normally do you put the

[00:13:32] IVs in them you stabilize them you start running IV fluids and you go or what they called scoop and run which is the ambulance would get there and wouldn't do a thing would literally pick him up throw him in the ambulance and get him into the hospital so now you had a randomized experiment which can uh infer causality and sure enough wouldn't you know it when you randomized to scoop and run you did better and so when I the first thing I thought about because nobody would believe this and it seems so counterintuitive um you know had your wife been able to drive you right to the hospital which is the most counterintuitive thing your odds are actually higher now it's fortunate that it all worked out but again when I was reading the story that was my thought was Barbara just take him right to the hospital now don't do anything don't call an ambulance don't do anything now of course the ambulance has some advantages they have Sirens they can do all these other things um but the bottom line is your life could only be saved in in an in an operating room or in an IR

[00:14:33] Suite those are the only two places you were going to get saved right and you can buy a little time with a blood transfusion but well you did need that as well but you needed that as you were rolling into those places right an ambulances it's changing a little bit now but ambulances you get IV fluid you don't get blood and um you know and the truth was they you know the when the ambulance showed up they came quickly but they were pro at my place for probably 15 or 20 minutes well that's the other thing about your story that's really remarkable is how you being probably a normal dude was kind of like yeah I'm fine I think I'm okay I probably don't need to go in and you almost talked them into it yeah yeah and right and and you know this is the famous statistic that even flashed through my mind at the time which was married men live longer and I watched it in action cuz my wife was like you know 10 minutes ago he was passing out and going blind and I don't care if he seems a little better right now he's going downtown like you're taking it right now but they still took quite a while and it really upset my wife did they take a blood pressure on you at that moment yeah and by the time they got there I'd gone into compensatory shock and my blood pressure was um uh sort of okay I think cuz I know that your pulse was okay which obviously is a compensation of being fit and healthy but yeah it's I

[00:15:51] I was as I was reading it of course I'm thinking your blood pressure was probably still 80 over 50 right like that would have been compensated enough for you to be not passed out right but that's not a normal blood pressure right right I'm you know I actually I don't remember I'm not quite sure but not but whatever it was it didn't um it did not trigger their alarm and they suggested that I stay and drink some water and re rehydrate in the shade right which would have killed me yeah um but at any rate we got to the um we got to the ER and um they rushed me into the trauma Bay the doctors knew immediately what was going on me I was pale as a sheet and I just had blood loss written all you know internal hemorrhage written all over me and um the doctor said cuz I so this is of course a a semi sort of memoir type book it's about my own experience which as a journalist I haven't done much of that i' in fact I've been averse to it my entire life making myself the topic um but because I'm also a journalist I wrote a sort of first-person account of something very intense and profound but

[00:16:54] I interviewed everyone I could to sort of confirm to myself that what my memories are roughly correct and to just do some reporting because that's what one does and so I interviewed all the doctors who would talk to me I even interviewed my wife I interviewed the guys who were in the back of the ambulance or the guy who was in the back of the ambulance and you know you had you were able to read all of the medical records which are very well documented right you timestamp every aspect of you know you I mean you would have seen the moment you arrived in the ER how many units of fluid how many units of blood all that stuff is is is communicated clearly in the record yeah and just a writer you know the language in these sort of specialty Fields is so fascinating like even if you don't quite understand um you know what's a French omn flush whatever you know I mean just the language is cool right like I know sometimes I put the language in there just CU it gives you the feeling of like wow I'm in I'm we're in we're we're in this world right and and I've always done that in my work but at any rate I interviewed everyone I could afterwards and um a couple of the doctors didn't want to talk to me I think just cuz they're you know sort of skittish for legal you know legal reasons even though the outcome was amazing right but they're still just so um so I got to the they they rush me into the trauma Bay and uh again these are my memories semic confirmed by people who were there um the the doctor asked I had no idea I was dying like absolutely none right what did you think was happening at that moment when you were sitting in the ER not in the ER in the trauma Bay rather you know I I sort of knew in my mind it's not a heart attack I don't have left side pain I I just I have a healthy heart like there's no reason to think it was a heart attack maybe a stroke like is that why I went blind for a while you know I was sort of trying to go through the possibilities as a non- doctor and how much pain did you still have in your abdomen when you I had a lot I had a lot of pain okay I mean it wasn't kidney stone pain right which is anyone who's had kidney stones I mean you know it's all but unbearable but but it was you know I mean I was I I was like Vis I'm sure I was visibly in pain right I mean you could tell I'm I'm wincing and I'm like I'm I'm I'm I'm sure it looked like yoube the pain of a broken leg something like that yeah and um so what I thought as far as I could come to a rational thought was you know what maybe was your abdomen swelling at all does that I mean

[00:19:21] I don't know if it was they might have nothing that you would have noticed no okay no I I was um there was abdominal guarding which I guess is the muscles tensing in the abdomen to protect an injured area and but I didn't know that and um I I had the thought the Grim thought you know what you might have cancer or something you might have a tumor in your abdomen that like ruptured and I'm making the stuff up as I go along but I was just like maybe something like that happened and you're going to wake up in the morning with some pretty Grim news about you know you got six months I mean I was sort of vaguely aware of that possibility I had absolutely no idea that hey man you are dying right now did an aneurysm cross your mind again not a pancrea I mean your your aneurysm is a very very obscure one but if you think of the two most common aneurysms in the abdomen one would be an abdominal aortic aneurysm the other would be a splenic AR artery aneurism which is not that far from where yours is although the cause is is hereditary yours is caused by the median arcu ligament as you described um but you know I'm sure you've heard of somebody dying from an aneurysm before I just curious as to what was going through yeah I mean I have a one of my best friends had an operation to replaces um aorta whatever they had to open them up and fix his aorta because he had aortic aneurysm so I knew about this but at one point a a nurse rushed in because they did a CAT scan on me I think it was a CAT scan they pushed me through the donut very quickly and I'm you know I'm in convulsing right I mean

[00:20:52] I'm deep in shock and I've got a heated blanket on me and they you know I was not doing well but she came up me and she said um You didn't hear it from me but good news it's not your aorta and so in my civilian non-medical mind I'm like your aart is part of your heart my my tummy hurts like what the what why are we even talking about the aort like I I had no idea so no the short answer is no and and um so I just um I just thought I might have terrible news tomorrow morning but

[00:21:24] I had no idea that I was you know it was going down right now and I'm so glad I didn't because I would have been absolutely terrified and I would have been thinking about my family my daughters a 3-year-old 6month old and and I and I you know my wife couldn't come with me what did you when you went back to interview your wife what did she think as the ambulance was leaving what was her level of concern it was she was very very worried because she'd seen me go in and out of

[00:21:53] Consciousness and she just had this sense like at some point he's going to go out and not come back she kept squeezing my hand saying honey stay with me stay with me stay with me and I sort of wake up and babble and not make any sense and then go out again so she had to watch all that right and um and then then the ER doctor called she couldn't follow me in the ambulance because of Co covid restrictions and then the ER doctor called it took him a while to get through to the phone because the phone lines weren't working and there was no cell phone service it was a nightmare right but he he finally got through and he said said um I think you should come to the hospital as fast as possible like don't drive 100 m an hour but if this were my wife I would be heading to the hospital fast and she knew she knew what that meant right so um she arranged for care for the children and jumped in the car and um drove to the hospital and the whole way knowing that I I might not make it like why else would the doctor say that and uh the doctor agreed to um told the hospital to wave the covid restrictions so that she could come in so she sort of knew oh this isn't good right and um I later looked up the odds for surviving what I had and they're pretty Grim right and that's with a quick transport time I mean it took me an hour and a half yeah it's just unbelievable to get there from the onset an hour and a half right and so you know thank God I'm healthy like I mean if I'd had a bad heart or whatever well again only because the the actual artery that had the aneurysm is quite small like had it been uh you know a splenic artery I mean forget an aort if it was the abdominal aorta you wouldn't have made it out of the cabin right right but but a slightly larger artery and I don't think you've survived given that you probably lost 60% of your blood volume into your abdomen is that what would you that's what they were that's what they were guessing something like that yeah um and and and I I I'm just sort of imagining how obscure this is like if I were in that situation I I would be assuming this was sort of a gastric ulcer gone bad like did they tell you what else they were assuming this was cuz it was pretty clear to them I would guess the second you arrived because not only do they see your vital signs your clinical signs at some point they've drawn blood and they've probably seen that your hemoglobin instead of being 14 which is what it should be or your hematocrite you know in the mid-40s was probably 10 or less at this point he said the doctor said he he had almost never seen hemoglobin so low as that he said that's what really I was 60 my blood pressure was 60 over 40 but he was like it was the hemoglobin that really alarmed him and no they didn't explain anything to me oh I just wonder if after the fact they walked you through their thought process as they cuz they had a very difficult decision to make which was to take you to the cath lab um or take you to the O that's a very very big decision you do a great job in the book of explaining the pros and cons of each um and and well I you know they made the right choice yeah well I stabilized on um hemodynamically stable I think is the term I stabilized on three units of blood which is kind of amazing because that's a fraction of the blood that you lost right you would have probably lost six or seven units so right I guess the you know the detail of this I think for the listener is interesting right so what has to have been happening is there has to have been some tyod there has to have been you know you lost six call it six seven units of blood but it must have created enough pressure around in in the in what's called the retrop peritoneum to create just enough to prevent more blood from going in so that when they gave you those three units those three units stayed in your in your vasculature as opposed to just continued to leak out right and the problem with going into the O and opening you up is you lose that pressure and you your blood geyser's out of there and they have to find the bleed before you bleed out and you know it just sounds like a a ghastly nightmare right yeah and and their only option honestly in that situation is to do what's called crossclamp the aorta so they actually have to take literally as ridiculous as that sounds you take a big clamp and you go above the diaphragm they might even open your chest and they put a clamp across the aorta good God and what that does is it absolutely stops any blood flow below point so the good news is your heart is going to be fine because your heart gets perused above the aorta your head is fine those are the two most important things and what's going to happen is your kidneys are going to start dying everything below the body is going to be is going to have no perfusion um but that buys them enough time to find what's wrong and can they find it if there's if it's not bleeding like well I mean you know it's very difficult right because they're going to have to go and see where the clot was and then they're going to let the clot they're going to let the clamp off see what comes reclam um oh my God yeah so so you know this was something we had to do all the time right in trauma is is is and sometimes you would have to do this in the operating room uh pardon me in the emergency room like a guy would come in and he'd have uh you know a gunshot wound or a stab wound to his aorta and you have to literally open his chest without anesthetizing him because of course he's already not responsive at this point and put hand in move his lungs out of the way get all the blood out of the way and get a clamp across the god wow um and I'm sure when you were you know covering the wars um this is this is this is you know stuff that was was being done in the field right right it was some of it was developed in the field apparently um so so they stabilized me with three units uh over the course of an hour and then sent me into the IR Suite while they were trying to track down the Interventional radiologist what time is it now it's late yeah it's like N9 o'clock at night okay right so they sort of called called him in from sort of dinner as it were and uh from his home Dr Phil dski and uh who was sort of known in the hospital as the magician because he was like super super good at his job and so

[00:28:14] Interventional Radiology involves putting someone on a fluoroscope which is like a sort of video feed x-ray machine and um and inserting catheters so rubber or wire um rubber tube tubes or wire into the vinous system usually through the right coin into the femoral artery and then threading it around through your body um trying to get through the twists and turns of your vasculature trying to get it to the site that needs that needs work and your aorta or your pancreatic artery or whatever it may be and that avoids having to open the person up because you can work from the inside out from inside the vascular system I mean I know you know all this but it's fascinating you know a lot of people don't I mean and you know one one

[00:28:58] Interventional radiologist was like you know even our spouses aren't entirely sure what we do like it's a rather Arcane you know sort of AR lesser known of the Medical Specialties but absolutely crucial and then there's one other thing that they can do there which I'm sure they explained was they can also when they want to inject contrast they did that you can look for oh where is where is it bleeding like where is it leaking out of this system here well my so my wife finally got to the hospital and they sort of stuck her in a basement and there's no really waiting room because it's co so she's sort of in the by herself in this room and um you know the janitor comes through once in a while to get the mop or whatever but it's uh she's sort of stuck there and at one point after hours she um a doctor runs Sprints through shout shouting into his cell phone it's the pancreas it's the pancreas she didn't know but he was talking about me they'd finally located the bleed in my pancreatic artery one of the I think five that goes into the pancreas and um so they started trying to get the catheter from my right groin in through my vasculature to the pancreatic artery and partly because of this um sort of strange Anatomy that I have the the vasculature in my abdomen is it was very difficult to navigate and uh they tried and tried and over the course of some hours I just kept failing to get there and this is um I don't I because I listened to your book on audio I didn't actually check are there figures in the actual book did you have an anatomic diagram of what the Celiac uh uh artery looks like coming off the aorta into its pancreatic tributaries I there's no diagr there's no diagam I think it's I think it would be really wonderful for people listening to us now to just go on

[00:30:44] Google and go to Google images and look up you know Celiac branch of the aorta or something like that uh with all of its tributaries and and I think what they'll appreciate especially if they just look at the arterial system is you have to imagine what it's like like to put a catheter in the femoral artery which is in the groin and then you have to snake it up the femoral artery which is really easy it becomes the aorta no problem and then you're going to pass some major branches right so the first thing you're going to pass on the right and left will be the renal arteries one going to each kidney um and and then there's like these little vertebral arteries and things on the way but but the the really big ones you're going to see will be two big ones that go to the gut they're called mesenteric arteries but then you get to the Celiac and the problem with the Celiac is and this is not even before we're talking about yours which is more problematic because it's compressed by the median arcu lingin but the problem is it's coming down so you know you describe this very well but I think sometimes the picture says a thousand words is like how are they going to get the catheter to go up right then come down then twist this way then twist that way right that's the real challenge with that big 180 degree hair pin turn right and right and and then my vasculature around the pancreas was very contorted and distorted by my the the ligament in the in the wrong place so um so they so I'm in the IR suite and um I'm I'm conscious right I mean they couldn't sedate me they didn't sedate me they give me a little bit of fentanyl Anders it but I I'm conscious right and I'm sort of I mean pain and cuz all this blood has settled around my kidneys in my back and my back was just in agony and I think it was all the blood that was around my organs are you conscious of time no I was I I mean I knew it had been I knew it had been forever I'll put it that way it seemed like a very long time but I I I didn't have a normal sense of wow it's probably been about 3 hours and I wasn't clocking it with that kind of precision but I was in and out of some mind I mean I I was a lot more there than I wished I'd been and at one point I saw the um at one point I started seeing faces in the terrifying faces in the machinery and uh in the floros scope that was above my head that was really you know really terrifying and reminded me of a very scary incident in Africa that happened to me so you know years earlier and um but then I watched the doctors come to this moment and I watched one of them say sort of shrug his shoulders and basically was like we righted like this I I don't this isn't going to work and the other one sort of nodded and I couldn't believe that I was sort of watching this and then the first

[00:33:37] Doctor Who I think was Dr dmowski said maybe we can try one last thing which is going through his left wrist instead of his crin and the other doctor Dr Goran said I like the way you think and that somehow allowed um them and approach that ultimately worked so they went through my left wrist and threw the Celiac from above and they had to get through the occlusion because the ligament is completely blocking the Celiac and has been for my entire life right and um they they inflated it um they were able to push it open and pass a a catheter through that and um and eventually get it to to the spot in where they could embolize the rupture they could block the rupture and pull their gear out and and you know they're on their way to saving my life but I should just say just because medicine is so extraordinary and I'm alive because of

[00:34:38] Any number of people the the team that was in the room but you know Decades of people inventing doctors researchers inventing this incredible technology and the 10 people who donated blood that you know they pumped into my veins to keep me alive so I'm I owe my life to many many good people but one of of them is a

[00:34:58] German doctor named forsman who um invented the um the venous catheter right and he did it it's kind of a funny story it was it was almost exactly a hundred years ago and he was a young guy young doctor in a in a small German hospital and his um he just had this idea that like why can't you push a catheter from a vein into your heart like why can't you do that or from an artery or from an artery right and and uh and um so he uh he asked his the director of the hospital for permission to do it on a patient and theor is like no we're here to heal them not to experiment on them like I think it was 1923 in Germany so so he's like okay well how about a dying patient he's like no we still can't do it so he snuck into the hospital he had a Confederate and a young nurse and he told her that he was going to do this procedure on her and she would be the first person to have a catheter inside her heart which doesn't seem like I think she was kind of sweet on him it doesn't seem like much of an inducement but she went for it right and so she laid down on the table he had her lie down on the table and he strapped her arm down and get ready for the procedure and after she was strapped down he turned away and numbed his own arm and cut his arm open and threaded a catheter into his Venus system and his arm and pushed it through and he had the tube marked off to where it would be just about in his heart and he pushed it to the the marker and then he released her from the table she was absolutely

[00:36:31] Furious apparently that she'd been cheated out of being like a medical first and um they walked down to the the hall to X-ray and and he told the technician to take an x-ray and prove that he was in his own heart with a catheter so I you know I owe my life to that guy too right and and to the nurse in some ways who got cheated I I remember the very first time I put a catheter into the heart as um was actually a medical student I I think today it might not be something they would let medical students do they might want to wait for you to be a little bit more senior but it was a little looser 25 30 years ago um and of course it was under supervision but to to to to put a what was called a swan Gans catheter from the uh subclavian vein into the heart and then ultimately into the pulmonary arteries to measure the pressure of the pulmonary system and you're sort of doing this and you you can't believe that you can do this you can't believe the human body which on the one hand is so delicate and you've seen what these walls of veins look like and that's even more scary than the walls of arteries because they're so thin right and you think boy if you screw this up this person will be dead in about a minute Jesus um yeah and you know then you sort of fast forward to what you experienced and the level of skill that is required I mean to to to put a balloon catheter from the subclavian vein into the pulmonary artery believe it or not is not that difficult I mean you know you have to absolutely know what you're doing but it but what what happened in your case is two orders of magnitude more skill required because they're threading something very small from your radial artery all the way up into the subclavian uh you know into the aorta retrograde down and then of course they still have to do everything you just described um and again it's you you can't you can't use too much force right you can't be you can't be a brute right it's it's a finesse thing yeah and and I so I was at a reading couple weeks ago in Atlanta and um at the uh I was you know talking about my book and I was talking about the um putting the putting the uh we didn't

[00:38:52] I didn't you put the CSE in your neck yeah right right so I was talking about putting the putting the line into into my jugular and there was a guy in the audience who had um needle phobia and I watched him just pass out in his seat while I'm talking about this like right in front of me right eyes rolled back in his head awful sort of strangling sounds coming out of his throat I mean just like I dropped him right and um unintentionally and so I called this for a doctor and is there a doctor in the audience right like I never thought I'd have to say that and this older guy two guys came rushing for the younger guy who was a paramedic who who wrote a um uh wonderful book called a thousand naked strangers which is a um uh a book about working on an ambulance and then another older guy came forward and they helped this guy he just passed out they helped him you know like and he was he was fine thank God and um but the older guy who came forward had trained the guy who saved my life Dr Dum Browski that was his mentor wow and and he said he said he said maybe 5% of Interventional radiologist could have done what Dr D brosi did he said you're really really lucky like extraordinarily lucky that you that you you really threaded the needle here medically um and uh so they so they after many hours they they managed to embolize the rupture and then I think they just knocked me out and sent me up to the ICU I briefly remember seeing my wife and holding her hand afterwards as

[00:40:21] I was getting rolled out um and I I my back was still in agony and I sort of on the way on the way through I begged her for a quick back rub and and uh the nurse was like no no no no back rubs we're going to the IU I was just in agony and then they knocked me out and I woke up to the sound of nurse's voices in the ICU the next morning and woke up um completely completely ignorant that

[00:40:48] I'd almost died I had no idea and it was the ICU nurse that said man no one can believe you're alive like you made it now was this the ICU nurse that you spoke about yeah so tell us a little bit about that discussion so as soon as as soon as she said Mr younger congratulations good morning you made it it's a miracle you know sort of it's a miracle as soon as she said that I sudden I was shocked horrified and shocked and then I had this memory from when I was on the threshold right it it came back to me instantly and this was the this was the sort of particularly for for me as an atheist this is the central mystery of my experience and whether it's brain chemistry or not this is the central sort of mystery that I've grappled with so when I was in the trauma Bay the doctor said to me can I uh uh I I want um asked permission to put a line like through my neck into my jugular right which didn't sound like a lot of fun and

[00:41:51] I had no idea I was dying and I didn't know what all the fuss was about and so I said is that you know is that really necessary like why and I said in case there's an emergency and he said this is the this is the emergency Mr younger right and he was a young guy he was like probably 25 I'm like kid I'm three times your age like

[00:42:08] What's Happening Here Right like and um so he started working on me and they use an ultrasound probe and you know this a whole they had the whatever this a whole whole procedure that I think probably doesn't take particularly long it felt like a long time to me and while I'm lying there and I'm feeling this pressure on my neck while they're starting to pre an area and you're under a sheet I'm under a AET clear plastic sheet right he asked he asked if I'm claustrophobic and since being in combat

[00:42:37] I combat may be extremely claustrophobic for some reason that I don't understand apparently that's quite common and uh he said are you claustrophobic and I said I I am actually and he said well that's too bad and he put the sheet over me and I was like oh finally someone with a sense of humor um so they're they're working they're working on my neck and to my shock to my horror suddenly beneath me and to my left I sense this black void open up this abyss and it's like this infinitely dark pit without Dimension and um and

[00:43:12] I'm getting pulled into it and again I have no idea that I'm dying but I I was like a I was like a wounded animal I just had this animal sense like don't go into the pit cuz if you go into the pit you're not coming back your eyes are open your eyes are closed well I'm conversing with the doctor so I don't know if they're open or not I mean and and I'm you know frankly not craning my neck to look down at the floor so it's not like I visually saw it but I felt it like I suddenly there was this pit it was it's like standing on the edge of a cliff you can kind of feel the you can feel the void right I was like oh my God

[00:43:46] I'm getting pulled into this hole right and it was a completely new experience I hadn't felt it before it was there very suddenly and it was um Unos right and I mean it was just this is what's happening and I got very scared and as I got scared suddenly I in quotation marks saw my dead father above me now not only am I an atheist but my father was an atheist he died eight years earlier he was a physicist and a rationalist and trained me well in all those practices basically right in that way of thinking about the world and my mother who was kind of a bit on the woooo side you know he drove her crazy by sort of asking precise questions about her beliefs like what do you mean bad energy like how how how what what how does bad energy make you sick you know like I mean he would ask things like that which it's amazing they stayed married but at any rate um suddenly my dead father was above me and to my left and I was shocked to see him because I'm still talking to the doctors right it's not like I had cardiac arrest and I'm in some some Nether world right I'm still there and there he is above me in the room and and he communicated to me something along the lines of it's okay you don't have to fight it you can come with me

[00:45:11] I'll take care of you right and I was absolutely horrified I mean it was almost grotesque I was almost offended like go with you you're dead why would I go with you like I'm alive I you know we have nothing to talk about and I love my dad right I said we have nothing to talk about you I'm not going anywhere with you why why do you think you weren't comforted by him in some way in like for example you hadn't seen him in eight years it's clear from your book that you have an amazing affection for your father it's not like this is a person you don't love or Miss um I just find it interesting and there's no answer to this question but um your aversion to his presence does it suggest to you that something about engaging with him in any way was T amount to death for you well he he was clearly inviting me to join him where he was and I knew he was dead right and and

[00:46:14] I you know I I wasn't literally thinking in my mind I have two little girls I'm married I have a lot to live for I'm only I'm only 58 for God's sake you know I mean I wasn't thinking those thoughts precisely MH but there was this basic dichotomy me there's the black pit there's my dead father and that's all death that's nothingness right that's you're outbound on a journey you're not coming back from into the nothing right that's what it felt like and he was part of that and I just I was almost offended that he would imagine that I would prefer to go with him into that than to stay in my life right and I almost worried that it would hurt his feelings and he was like on that level of of like don't you want to spend time with your daddy you know like and was like no you're dead like I want to spend time here for the rest of my life we'll talk later you know and um it was a very very visceral response and I really was horrified and one of the theories about near-death experiences is that it's a form it's an

[00:47:18] Adaptive sort of like Behavior that's a form of comforting you know it's comforting to the dying person that they see beloved loved ones and ah I'm not just leaving this life I'm you know I'm sort of going you know I'm sort of crossing over into this beautiful world of all these dead people that I miss and you know it's going to be fine like that was absolutely not the case for me I was horrified and um and I said to the doctor you because he just kept fumbling around what to me felt like fumbling around with my neck right I know that's not fair to him but that's what it felt like and um I said you got to hurry I'm going like I didn't know where I was going I didn't know I was dying but I knew I was going somewhere where I wasn't coming back I knew that much and um and he got the line in and they started transfusing me so are you realizing this for the first time in the

[00:48:12] ICU the next day or are you just remembering it and now experiencing it sort of through your memory the second time in the ICU I remembered experiencing it for the first time I see right like uh I um it was an extremely powerful memory and it was and it was terrifying and you know I just woken up from whatever they put me you know like put me under with and the nurse you know

[00:48:41] I was woken up by the nurse talking over me talking to the other ICU nurse and I was woken up by Voices I opened my eyes she said you know good morning Mr younger congratulations right and as soon as she said it I remember remembered that I'd had this terrifying encounter this horrifying encounter with my father and with the pit and it was the next thing I thought so it wasn't like in the you know my brain was so confused it was like I was extremely drunk or something like that my brain was so confused in those moments I was rational enough to speak to the doctor but I was in a very strange state of mind so it wasn't like in that moment I was thinking oh my God oh my God oh my God I'm seeing my dead father I wasn't didn't have that kind of self-conscious awareness of the moment the way when we might now I mean if I saw my dead father above me right now

[00:49:30] I'd be think I'd be like uh do you see that above us cuz he's right there like it wasn't like that right but um it was the first thing that came back to me when I when I woke up and um and it was the first thing I I asked my wife because again I'm I'm a journalist and I'm a skeptic and I was you know sort of worried that I'd somehow C unconsciously cooked all this up later right and so I asked my wife like well what when you came into the room what happened like what did I and uh and and she said she said the first thing you said to me was

[00:50:06] I almost died last night and I and I saw my father it was the first thing I told her and um so whatever that means I'm confident that I had some sort of experience in those moments and not one that was sort of like conjured later retro retroactively I can't prove that of course but that's my sense about it so say more about this nurse what else did she tell you yeah so she um she she dropped that bomb on me right and then and left to go attend to the other patients and I'm sitting I'm lying on the bed you know I've I've got six units of blood and floating sloshing around in my abdomen I got 10 people's blood inside me um I got tubes all over the place I'm in incredible pain I'm throwing up blood because somehow the blood got into my digestive system as well and I was throwing up blood that whole morning it was really unpleasant and um and uh I'm trying to digest this news that I almost died it just seemed inconceivable um it would be as inconceivable as when you wake up in the morning you know tomorrow morning when you wake up instead of waking up in your bed at home with your wife you wake up in a hospital and first thing you hear is you almost h you almost died last night right like that it's that it was that inconceivable like what even though you remember the events of the day that led you there yeah but nothing that didn't ease the you know I

[00:51:41] I didn't know what you know I didn't know anything about what dying feels like and I pictured it to feel way more catastrophic than what I experienced right I was in compensatory shock the whole drive down there and then I was in a very very weird State and in a lot of pain and it just was incon able to me that this was the the this was the it right like this is the big the big deal this is dying this is like it it just seemed like it would there'd be more blood on the floor there'd be something right you know I mean it just I just it was I had belly pain like it just didn't but it didn't resonate to you yet that your you know if there were 10 pieces of

[00:52:17] Swiss cheese that were placed on top of each other you happen to be one of those 10 Stacks where a pencil still made it through right right did did that occur to you yet cuz there was again there's so much freakish luck right there like we could recount it all but we don't need to right there's at this point there were 10 things yeah all of which had to happen for you to survive right up into including having the right

[00:52:44] Interventional radiologist there did that resonate yet or was it not till later and when I when I figured that out when I found that out as I started to do the research every time I encountered another facet of how unlikely it was I I would get incredibly depressed and it still and it still it still depresses me like I when I talk to the the mentor of the guy who saved my life and he said you know Dr dumbrowski is one of maybe you know maybe in the 5% of all IR guys who could have saved your life you know

[00:53:15] I felt my spirits just plummet right and there wasn't any of the sort of like former athlete in me of like yeah I did something almost no one else could do you know there wasn't any pride in there right it was it was I wonder if there's a different a different um is there a sense of um I don't know what the right word is it's not gratitude that's a bit glib um is there a sense of awe in that or is there a sense of do you believe there's meaning in that or do you believe that there's no meaning in that and that it's just as fortunate uh it's just as much luck as the world is full of bad luck right if I think of all the you know I'm I'm much more familiar as I'm sure you and many people listening are uh we're much more familiar with the opposite right it's like the person who did everything right and they just happened to get hit by some drunk idiot who ran a red light and there was you know virtually nothing they could have done to have prevented it it's purely a lightning strike um and and how often does bad luck take a life just as remarkable luck saved a life do you process it like that at all yeah I do I mean it it I you know we all are sort of looking for meaning in the universe and and you know nothing you know there are no coincidences and everything happens for a reason and all those sort of like narratives that we put on a I think a fairly random universe and uh I mean random but for the laws of physics but um in terms of the events of our life like so I you know I was at an American Outpost in

[00:54:49] Afghanistan and um I I I was shocked to feel some sand flicking into the side of my face you know bullets travel faster than sound right and The Outpost would get attacked from about 500 M out which is quite a long shot for an AK-47 or a PKM and and um by the time those bullets arrive but the bullets arrive way before the sound does right so some sand flicked to the side of my face I just had time to think what was that I was standing against some sandbags what was that and then I heard d da d d d and I was so that was the first burst of an hourong firefight and the bullets had to to have hit with maybe an inch or two from my forehead right um in my opinion utterly random right I was blown up by an IED it went off under the engine block instead of under us the the guy with the CL you the the Taliban guy with the clacker in the

[00:55:40] Ravine missed it by a second a second right but the whole rest of my life unfolded because of that it's contained in that second right in some ways and because we were spared and so at one point I was at a reading early early on you know right when the book came out and um a guy raised his hand at the end he was quite agitated and he said uh he said I'm Christian and you you're alive because of God's grace and you have to come to Jesus and understand that it was only God's grace that saved you and I said to him you know my one of my best friends my brother my colleague Tim heatherington was killed in combat in

[00:56:21] Libya on an assignment I was supposed to be on his death was what got me out of War reporting and then had a family Etc and you know he he bled out also right I mean from a wound in his groin and but he was in the war zone and they couldn't save him and um and so I said to the guy I said you know my problem with that way of thinking that there's some purpose here some meaning here is why me right like why me and not Tim for that matter why me and not some nine-year-old with cancer I'm sorry like and if God is running a random lottery for his grace I don't want any part of it right

[00:56:56] I think that the universe is run in you know it it unfolds in in in random ways and I just got super super lucky but that the fact that I got that lucky makes me profoundly grateful and is also incredibly depressing to me um and for some reason for reasons that I can't quite understand but I just sort of think about what was statistically supposed to happen by a factor of maybe 10 into one or something and or or more probably more probably more right um and uh have you spoken with others I'm just very curious about that Sebastian I'm the the Gratitude makes a lot of sense to me and I don't know how I would feel in your situation so this is this is curiosity and not certainly not judgment

[00:57:46] I'm curious though if you've spoken with others who have survived you know similar experiences I think of my friend Rick Elias I should introduce you guys so Rick was on that uh US Airways flight that head to emergency land in the Hudson right right so again you've got this guy you know Captain solenberger who like you know he's the he's the one out of you know right he that's exactly right he's the one out of 50 guys that could have actually make the right decision with enough time to spare and then carried it out and again I that's he wasn't supposed to live right and I'm just I I've never asked him this question and but you know this be an interesting topic is how many other people on this planet who are alive only because of monumental luck um what is the balance between the Gratitude and the the heaviness of that that that that tips into sort of dymia you know if I didn't have children I think it would be psychologically a little easier um but what it would have left them with was such a legacy of pain and absence and and my poor wife that that that made it sort of harder and so every the things that console would have consoled me like holding my daughter like I survived and here I'm holding my daughter in my lap and I immediately think oh but this wasn't supposed to happen right she's supposed to be G grieving me right now by odds of 100 to one she should you know like and it's a miracle and then I would just spin out into what could have happened and I eventually talked to her shrink right I mean my wife was like honey you're getting a little hard to live with like can you seek help and it was a great thing to do and a really really helped me and my my therapist was basically she was like listen if you keep telling yourself this narrative that you almost died you're never going to escape this incredible anxiety and panic disorder and depression that you've worked yourself into you have to stop telling yourself this story she was absolutely right and apparently this sort of negative storytelling is very very common in people who almost died like and and um the the sequence of really really really profound anxiety and fear par medical paranoia it's going to happen again any moment I'm going to bleed out again you know like that sort of paranoia and then that finally eased off and I wound up in this like unbelievable depression and I've never been depressed in my life right and I'm not a particularly anxious person and I was amazed at how debilitating

[01:00:16] Depression was and I finally got it cuz I've had friends who have struggled with depression I lost a friend to suicide and suddenly I was like oh this is what it's what they're talking about like why bother going through the rest of your life like that kind of thought like I had no idea like it was it really opened a door into like oh I had no idea that's what when people say depression this is what they're talking about and um you know was it was quite it was quite frightening one of the problems I so I had trouble I know we have to get back to the nurse which is which is part of this problem right this reality problem that I had I was having trouble understanding being confident about what reality was and what it wasn't and part of that stemmed from this um somewhat Clairvoyant dream that I had so um I and I just have to re reiterate

[01:01:09] I'm really not a spiritual mystical or wooo person I'm really not right which is why this stuff unsettled me so much right much more your father than your mother much more right which is why this is unsettling to me right and if so 36 hours prior the only symptoms I had that something was AR in my abdomen was sort of intermittent pain that would come and go and you know if I were more responsible I would have gone to the doctor and they would have scanned me and they would have seen a big ass aneurysm in my pancreatic artery and they would have fixed it with all the without all the drama right but I didn't do that and it wasn't consistent enough to like get me to the doctor and and I just thought anything that's going to kill me is going to be agonizing I just thought in a stupid way I was like it's it's not going to if if I can bear the pain it's not going to what could it do right so um I thought I I had irritable bowel syndrome as I sort I cooked up for some internet Googling right and what it probably was was the aneurysm starting to dissect a little bit and leak a little bit of blood into my abdomen and that's the pain I was feeling and and uh and my body on some level I think knew like there's a there's a five alarm fire coming right and um so 36 hours prior to nearly dying I was woken up at dawn so my family we co-sleep and um in on a big pad on the floor and I was woken up by at dawn by this horrific nightmare a nightmare that I've never of the sort

[01:02:41] I've never had I've never even heard of and in the nightmare I was already dead it started with me already dead I'm a ghost I'm a spirit and I don't know that I'm dead and my family is below me and they're they're grieving and I realize they're grieving me and I'm try and I don't know I'm dead right so I'm like waving my arms and Y shouting hey I'm over here I'm right here I'm right here and they can't hear me and they can't see me and then I made to understand that it's too late that because of my own stupidity like my I didn't take my life seriously and I assume this to mean the intermittent pain in my abdomen I because I didn't take things seriously I was Cavalier about life like capital L life I was

[01:03:30] Cavalier about life and now it's too late there's no going back you're dead and you're outbound and you're not coming back and I was so frantic with Terror and anguish and shame incredible sense of shame in the dream or when you w up in the dream just that I had somehow squandered this great treasure of life I just hadn't taken I hadn't taken something seriously and now there's no going back there's no retrieving it and it w and it woke me up and suddenly I'm in my bed I'm like oh thank God I'm not dead cuz it had felt so real I sort of clutched my little girl right I was woke up next to my eldest daughter and I clutched her like

[01:04:11] I've seen her clutch her stuffies right just like oh thank God you're here like that I'm here I mean I was just overwhelmed with gratitude and fear but were you in pain when you woke up was the abdominal pain present no it wasn't it was just a dream that pain was very very rare and intermittent but sort of unmistakable how long had it been going on about six months did the dream cuz you had a full day after that dream before the day where this all happened in that one Lucid day did it cross your mind that that dream really that I talked to my wife about it and you know

[01:04:52] I'm an older dad I had my first child at 55 and I sort of red it to just sort of mortality anxiety about being an older Dad how how long am I going to live into their lives into their hopefully adult lives um I didn't really think about it and lots of compartments in my head lots of I I put things places where I can't reach stuff you know as a you know dealing with fear and other things as a journalist you need those compartments and you can't function and I got extremely good at sort of like having these sort of like firewalls that separate me from emotions that like are problematic and get in the way of what

[01:05:26] I'm trying to do and um it's you know it's that's to some degree it's adaptive and helpful in our lives and after a certain point it's maladaptive and I you know clear clearly I'd got to that point right um but I didn't but I didn't know it and um so after coming back from the hospital and I will get back to the nurse because she's crucial here but after coming back to from the hospital I was in I was I was in the ICU for 5 days I recovered very very quickly um and and and in the general flooor population for a couple days and then they then they disch charged me I was out of there right and

[01:06:01] I got home and I started researching ndes near-death experiences because I was really confused about seeing my father in The Black Pit and the rest of it and so it turns out that I had a rather classic nde and um you know the ND experiences they're they're not sort of infinite in variety right like there's an infinite number of hallucinations you might have on LSD but the ndes they fall into sort of like half a dozen basic sort of buckets right a a black pit a tunnel with a light at the end of it dead relatives showing up hovering over your body there's like half a dozen sort of basic scenarios and what's interesting about this sorry to interrupt Sebastian because again I think it's it's really fascinating this is technology and culture agnostic yeah in other words these stories that you researched um and and others have as well it doesn't seem to matter when like as far back as we have record right it's the same thing so it's not like well we're influenced this is just a result of the TV shows we watch right um and again it's culturally agnostic which is also it's odd right it's not like Christians have C you know whatever like the slight slight variations between cultures but but but but not um not enough to ascribe it to culture right it seems like a more

[01:07:26] Universal experience yeah um and so I'm researching this stuff and one of the classic ND nde experiences is hovering over your family or over the sort of surgery bay where the doctors are losing you right and unable to communicate and you're sort of above them and you're getting tugged between this Force that's pulling you outwards into the you know the Beyond and this the see last ties to your Earthly C and so you know I had no interest in ndes at all I didn't know anything about them I just you know like so I had these experiences with a rather Clean Slate right I'm not culturally prepped for these experiences right and so I I I realized I had rather classic ndes both in the moment and also in this weird dream and this was the fear that I was seized with and this is how paranoid and anxious I was I thought oh my God obviously I died in my sleep that was my dream was my experience of actually dying and my wife woke up to her dead husband in the bed and I don't know it because I continued on under the illusion that I went to the hospital that I came back that here I am holding my daughter in my lap like and it's one long dying hallucination and

[01:08:54] I'm not really here I'm a ghost I'm imagining all this and you know it's laughable except it's not disprovable exactly I was just about to say that's the that's the challenge right and if you're sufficiently traumatized and I've been traumatized in combat and I like I know there's a sort of bumpy road to recovery afterwards I I know it pretty well it sort of Fades over time like the

[01:09:16] G grief when you lose a loved one whatever they were were designed to adapt to survive right humans we amazing we're resilient right unless you're particularly traumatized when you're young which makes resilience harder so I know that terrain right this was it completely eclipsed anything from combat right and and I was really traumatized by this because you know when you're a war reporter you're deliberately you're making a conscious choice to go to the poker table and bet your chips right all right I'm going to go to Bosnia I'm going to go to Ukraine I got some chips

[01:09:49] I think I'm a good enough poker player I can wager my chips come back with more chips right career whatever experience whatever it is maybe I'll get a book out of it I'm going to come back with more chips before I lose my shirt right I'm going to leave the poker table before I lose everything and I'm going to come back with these sort of riches whatever they whatever they may be experiential riches right professional riches I stopped doing that I was like oh Tim got killed I'm you know I'm going to get cleaned out the next time I'm leaving the poker table right and I had a family and so what was so traumatizing was that

[01:10:23] I thought I was safe right right and it's like it's like owing the mafia money right like there's nowhere you can go where you won't have to pay this back we will find you you can go to Northern Canada you can you can go to Kolkata we are coming after our 100K and you can't hide from us and that basically is what the universe is doing he like look we loaned you some carbon right to make your body out of we will be reclaiming that eventually Mr juger Right and I thought I could sort of delay that and you can't you just don't know none of us know that this isn't the last day of our life I woke up that morning with not a clue right other than this crazy dream not a clue that this was it a beautiful June day right and that's what was so incredibly disturbing and it was what um sort of warped my mind afterwards and then I found out and there was some consolation in this that thinking that you're not alive is is is a not uncommon delusion for people who almost died it's a sort of known thing and likewise the depr R the anxiety like

[01:11:27] I I was doing something that many people have almost died and particularly almost died for medical reasons have gone through so there was some there was some sort of comfort in that but let me finally return to this amazing nurse so um so I woke up to the sound of a middle-aged the voice of a middle-aged woman with a heavy Boston accent which makes sense because I was in hyanis

[01:11:50] Massachusetts right talking about um there were she and the other nurse were discussing me right and I woke up ah good morning Mr younger congratulations you almost died last night right then then they left right to talk to other attend to other patients and I I just sat there trying just thinking about this this news like like I almost died last night are you kidding me like it was horrifying and is not the sort of woohooo party like wow I almost here I am let's celebrate it was absolutely crushing and um I sat there physically incredibly compromised and in a lot of pain and throwing up blood and thinking about the fact that i' almost you know as they say had almost bought the farm and and not known it and she came back like an hour later and said how you doing how you doing Mr younger you know like the accent and um

[01:12:53] I said um well I'm okay but um frankly what you told me is terrifying and I can't stop thinking about it and she said um try this instead of thinking about it like something scary try thinking about it like something sacred and then she walked out and so then I lay there thinking about that now um I'm you know I don't go to church um I don't believe in

[01:13:22] God but the word sacred I feel is one that us secular people have every right to use and there's very very fine secular meanings that you can bring to it and for me sacred something sacred a sacred T task is anything that allows people to live with more dignity more love more freedom less fear like that's those those are sacred things and it you know religion can be sacred because it can achieve those things it can really Elevate human dignity appli in the right ways it can also obviously destroy it um um therapists can be can have a sacred you know like School teachers um even journalists right in my mind I'm like okay where what do we do you know on our best days right we go to places that are at least difficult and hard and intimidating if not downright dangerous and we try to come back with information that

[01:14:25] Society the human race can make some use of to to chart a better course to maybe protect human dignity in Ukraine a little bit better um to help the human lot a little bit right like that and that is a sacred task in by my own secular definition of what sacred is and I've done this my whole life and it's a responsibility and frankly an honor that

[01:14:48] I take extremely seriously and I'm very proud to be able to do and and feel quite sort of humble about it like wow really me I get to do this you know and it's a really um it's one of the things that in being a a f not just a father but a good father and a good husband so one of the things that I am the most proud of in my life is that I was able to do this um passing well for a number of years right and so I thought what about what about now I stopped going to front lines but then I went to the ultimate front line which is my own death my own mortality this thing we all face and that almost all of us fear

[01:15:25] I was allowed to go to the precipice look over the edge and then allowed to come back did I come back with any sacred knowledge in other words any knowledge that will help me or other people live with more dignity less fear more connection more love etc etc that's that's the task right that's what this nurse has asked me to do now she she might have meant it in a completely Christian sense I have absolutely no idea I after I recovered and started thinking about writing a book I um of course I thought because I interviewed everyone who I could at the hospital and elsewhere I thought I got to talk to this lady this amazing woman like what did she what did she mean I mean I know what I you know I I know what I what use I made of of it but what did she mean right so I called the hospital they you know the P you know the sort of media relations office and they weren't much help and then I finally got a phone line in the ICU and asked the you know the gal at the desk like so any a middleaged lady Boston accent you know like was working on June 17th No No One by that description here no there's a young woman with a Boston accent but no no she hasn't she's been off lately you know whatever I mean so and and I kept calling and trying to you know like and I could not find her and when I told the story at a reading one woman said well clearly she was your guardian angel and you know she appeared to help you in your moment of need oh maybe I mean I don't know right or a traveling nurse that they forgot about or something or right yeah exactly yeah or in just a hospital bureaucracy they couldn't figure out who she was or um or she didn't want to talk to the Press right she was like no way I'm not talking to this guy right he saw his dead father I have nothing to do with this right like who knows right the no idea but because

[01:17:23] I had such trouble figuring out what was reality and what wasn't you know of course it crossed my mind I mean I saw my dead father maybe I imagined a nurse you know maybe I imagined a nurse who had exactly the information the idea which of course is contained somewhere in me I just didn't have access to it who had the information that I needed at that moment so you know who knows and it doesn't really matter but it was um an extraordinary experience for me you know anybody who remembers our first discussion and who who Who's familiar with your work knows that no one's ever accused you of being disconnected right so it's not like prior to uh June 17th or June 16th 2020 you were a guy who was distracted you were a guy who was you know numbing the pain of life with with honic pleasures and things of that nature um you know you're you are literally the only person

[01:18:23] I know who doesn't have a smartphone who lives you know as close to Off the Grid as possible and all of that permits you to have this remarkable connection with the people who matter most to you most most importantly your family so it's almost a little um ironic that if we consider this a gift it was given to you you almost think that if anybody needs a gift like this it's it's someone like me right it's a guy who's way more distracted and way more frenetic and and and maybe like most people listening could use the realignment of of of what is sacred so given all of that I I'm really curious what has changed in you right so what I would say is um you know as I sort of went into my midlife um I dropped a number of things that made me feel very very good when I was young right I I I really enjoyed alcohol frankly I never did any drugs but I really enjoyed alcohol I sto I N9 years ago I stopped drinking I wasn't an alcoholic but you know it was just it was playing a role in my life that I I'm wasn't interested in continuing and um uh I stopped I was a totally obsessive athlete right so I was a pretty good marathon runner and distance

[01:19:42] Runner when I was young I ran 412 for the mile which isn't world class but it's a decent time I ran 221 for the marathon 30 minutes for 10K you know decent decent times requiring an obssessive amount of effort those for people who don't run those are exceptional times um and you know the effort consumed my life and and you know it it I was running 100 120 miles a week at six minute pace you know and and didn't you know I was clearly avoiding something I mean and I look back I was clearly avoiding a certain sort of emotional experience that I didn't feel prepared for and probably wasn't mature enough for wasn't ready for yet and it did all that quite well and you know my father was a brilliant um really was quite a brilliant physicist in his in his specialty of

[01:20:29] Acoustics um you know he was on he was very very clearly on the Spectrum Spectrum Disorder runs uh disorder is a bad word because it has so many adaptive uses but so Spectrum tendency um you know definitely runs through my family and I can see it in both directions Downstream and Upstream from from me um and there is a certain sort of um focus of mind that uh you know you're looking at the world through a toilet paper tube right like you're seeing the small circle of light and that's all you're seeing which means you can focus incredibly intensely on it right and you're pretty oblivious to everything else and what I watch my father do and I have a watered down version of it of this is this sort of like dogged pursuit of some kind of penetrating Insight some kind of Excellence some kind of transcendent accomplish um yeah we get there right like I I you know if I may say this about myself I write good books that affect people like

[01:21:33] I did it right like I figured out how to do it it requires a huge amount of concentration my my father really Advanced physics in interesting ways right a lot of his fellow physicists are exactly the same way just asked their wives you know like like out to lunch most of the time right so I so what what the cost of that is you're you're not experiencing your life in emot terms and when there are emotions in your life that are unpleasant or even terrifying to deal with um you could actively turn on this obsessive focus in order to avoid dealing with it right so there's a kind of passive not notice I don't notice I don't notice but then when an emotion a threatening emotion comes along like a painful breakup or whatever it may be then you can really turn you know like turn on the turn on the the the Jets right and really blast off into whatever

[01:22:28] Direction you're doing for a while was 120 m a week then later in my life it was this pursuit of Journalism this maniacal Focus that I'm capable of and once you get into that um once you get into that sort of rhythm of being able to go through life you're richly rewarded for the accomplishments that come with that kind of focus so Society is around you saying well done sir awesome amazing you you know your book changed my life your blah blah blah whatever whatever it may be you might be a musician you might be that comes in all flavors right um and so you think your life is a raging success but actually you're not experiencing the a the actual feeling of being alive all the time right and um I remember at one point um so I've been married I'm my second marriage my first marriage didn't work

[01:23:23] I'm still very good friends with my ex-wife um but the marriage didn't work and as we exited as my first wife and I exited that marriage um any divorce is incredibly sad and painful even if it's amicable which ours thank God was and uh we're both good people and we loved each other and we did it really quite well and but I was incredibly sad and I I you know I was still going through this sort of the legal process of divorce div and really very very sad uh and found myself in this wonderful new relationship that turned into my second marriage and my family so it all you know it's all ended ended quite well for both both me and my former wife so in this process I would because I'm not in touch with my feelings at all um or at least unless absolutely necessary um I would go into these I would just drop into these pits right of sadness and I and I didn't know what they were and my wife Barbara the woman

[01:24:28] I'm married to said said one day she said honey you seem something seems up today like are you all right and I said no I'm not I I feel really strange I don't know what it is and um she said maybe um you know your the divorce is you know like you're you're going through all this stuff maybe um maybe you're just really sad I was like oh my God you're right that feeling that not feeling quite right it's sadness why you know why are you so brilliant like I'm sad that's exactly what it is I couldn't believe her Insight right and so I said to her not tongue and cheek not trying to be funny before I could catch myself I said you know in the future if you could tell me how I'm feeling it would be so helpful it's like you're a freak right like what are you talking about and so all that that to say that you're right I'm not distracted I'm tuned out it's the yeah right I'm out I'm out there not as bad as my father my my my father and again I

[01:25:36] I sort of this is real physicist territory was like really really out there but I'm out there enough and there's enough sort of problematic and painful emotional territory in my life that it was I found quite a good refuge in athletics and then this incredible sort of like professional Endeavor that I so completely fell in love with you know twice you've alluded to the fact that you're an atheist and yet I think that something that is worth pointing out here is that whether a person is an atheist or a Believer doesn't speak to another dimension which is is there or is there not an afterlife and those two do not require each other no in other words there's really a two by two that we should be considering here which is is there a god or a Creator or is there not right and is there an afterlife or is there not right and there are four there are four squares there yeah I saw you draw four squares on your piece of paper and I was like oh I think I know what's coming yes and I've been thinking a lot about this right because the god problem is an enormous problem right because on the one hand I don't actually understand how any of us exist in the sense that like if you just think about it stochastically it doesn't make any sense sense none of this makes sense it I I can't it does there's no amount of knowledge I have about biology mathematics and physics that explains why I'm sitting here and why you're sitting here and why we're doing what we're doing right now right the three billion base pairs that Define you the three billion base pairs that

[01:27:15] Define me each of those base pairs has four possible you know uh DNA uh uh mole ules that could Define them like we don't the the numbers are so big they don't they don't add up you you so none of this makes sense so you can go down the path of well there must be a Creator but then you're stuck with the who created the Creator problem and and then you wrap yourself around that axle okay so let's let's not even interrogate that because I don't neither of us are equipped to um and it sounds like neither of us are particularly predisposed to believe that anyway but if we just focus on this afterlife question which again doesn't require a god necessarily um it's hard to do it without talking about physics right yeah I mean ultimately it's hard to talk about anything without talking about physics I mean at the end of the day that's the um that's what the world is that's what reality is made up out of is is uh particles and atoms and the laws of physics that govern them so yes I agree now one of the one of the things you wrote about in your book that I couldn't believe was your your relationship to one of the greatest physicists um of of the last 100 plus years uh which is Irwin Schrodinger um you want to recount the story of how how how you uh how you find yourself within uh his sphere yeah so my father grew up in

[01:28:48] Europe he was born in Dresden his father was Jewish his mother was Austrian Italian Catholic and um which which was an unheard of pairing back in um uh you know the 19 19 teens 1920s your father's born right after World War I yeah he's born in 1923 and Dresden 10 years later the Reich doog fire Germany is they the you know people know where this is headed and um they they DeCamp for Spain um his dad my dad's dad was faric and ashkanazi Jew Jewish so he spoke Spanish and Russian and German and um so they went to Spain and three years there my dad's 13 when the fascists come in under

[01:29:40] Franco and so now my father's fluent German and fluent Spanish they leave Spain for France and he goes to French high school and then uh when he is is uh 17 I think the Germans come into France so now he they flee France W wind up in Portugal picks up Portuguese along the way and then lands in America and learns English so as I am fond of saying thanks to the fascists my father spoke you know five languages fluently right five European languages fluently um and so he so that's how he came to America but he his F his mother's side of his family was from was from Austria from

[01:30:27] Saltsburg are upper middle class and um they um the my father's mother was born in 1900 and was this great Beauty it was known as a great Beauty in the small city of Saltsburg as were her her um the twin the twins ET and vti younger and um they were sort of renowned as teen girls for for being really beautiful and they happen to know the family happened to know the schroers shinger this preeminent physicist schroedinger's cat one of the fathers of quantum mechanics

[01:31:07] Etc and um Nobel Prize and uh so shinger was in his 40s and had a family and was a bit of a dog right I mean Affairs all over the place and as many people had then and still do I suppose and so at one point these girls the twins are um they're failing math they're failing high school math right they're 16 they're failing high school math and the mother has the great idea of calling schroedinger's wife saying you know I know your husband's a mathematician my girls are failing math do you think they could come visit for the summer in Germany where the schroers were living could come visit for the summer and maybe he can sort of tutor them in math I mean just think you just have to understand how completely ridiculous I mean it's like Einstein right it's like they're failing s you know like sophomore math like can you can he can can Irwin help them so off the girls go for a summer in

[01:32:10] Germany and schinger falls in love with iy uh one of the twins and he manages to get them through their math tests right that he um but the math is so simple that he actually doesn't understand it very well because it's so simple so he has has to consult with his wife's lover who's a mathematician not a physicist right and so there's this whole I mean there's just the dra the sort of romantic drama of these people was just extraordinary and anyway thank God the girls passed their exams and and ET and schinger um they they Tastefully wait until she's 18 and he's 45 or something and um they have this passionate Affair the last some years tragically she got pregnant the pregnancy was aborted and as a result she was never able to have children and you know I knew her much later in her life when I was a child um and and she was married and you know a rather sad a rather sad figure frankly um probably due to you know what was really a tragedy in young woman's life of losing the ability to have have children um but he was really he was really in love with her and so that so short her and the family I mean I have letters that he wrote I mean I have letters and poems that he wrote her right handwritten in fact there's a biography of shinger a wonderful biography that came out in the 80s uh and or 90s and in the bookmark where my father had you know like marked something The Bookmark is a handwritten letter by shinger to ET like that's the bookmark in the biography that I found in the shelf so that's our that's our history with shinger so we talk about his cat many people probably know the experiment but it's it's it's a thought experiment a g downin experiment that's worth maybe explaining because it really speaks to the challenge of at least one of the challenges of understanding quantum mechanics um do you want to just briefly sort of explain this thought experiment and what purpose it serves in understanding this yeah so one of the the central Enigma and mystery of quantum physics is the um the fact that when you if you don't observe what a subatomic particle is doing and I'm speaking as a Civ Ian who tried to read and tried to understand physics so I'm doing my best to render it sort of like understandable U but I'm not a physicist so the mystery is when you do not observe and try to measure the um the M momentum and position of a subatomic particle um that it appears to be in all possible places uh it's a waveform and if you fire say a photon at a steel plate with two slits in it the photon unobserved the photon will go through both slits and leave uh leave a signature on the strike plate on the other side um that shows it simultaneously went through both slits we can't do that we cannot walk through two doorways at the same time in the macroscopic world you're in one place or the other but unobserved a subatomic particle appears to be able to go through two slits at the same time it's basically a huge potentiality that that only collapses into one single thing it only goes through one slit if you actually observe it right and um and measure it and so the in unavoidably the thought arises the thought arose to these early physicists um uh Heisenberg and schinger and number of others most of whom were from the Germans speaking world for some reason uh and dirak from from of course from England the the um the unavoidably the thought arose is our conscious observation of subatomic reality creating the thing that we observe and if so is our observation of the entire universe creating the obser the universe as observed right what you know what is what exactly is happen happening and are we are we creating what we see by seeing it um and so shinger came up with a sort of thought experiment a gunan experiment uh which is that you have a cat why he picked a cat I don't know but he put a cat in a box with the what he called I think the translator from the German is um what he called a fish mechanism and the fish mechanism is an isotope that has exactly a 50/50 chance of decaying in the next hour I'm trying to now now I'm now I'm a little rough on the details there's and if and if it decays in a certain way it will emit enough radiation to kill the cat and if it doesn't the cat is fine so basically it's just that there's a 50/50 chance that this decaying isotope will kill the cat or not kill the cat I think actually what it is is that it the radiation triggers the release of a of a gas that instantly kills a cat so there's another step doesn't matter the idea is exactly 50/50 right and um and the cat's in this enclosed box and after an hour one thing or the other there's a 100% chance that one thing or the other happen there's no third possibility right where the cat's like a little sick right right it's one or the other it's a complete binary and um and you know likewise at the subatomic level particles are in one place or another it's a complete binary there isn't like in the macroscopic world you know a pendulum sort of swings and is in you know traverses through all the different spaces at the quantum level you're in one place or another likewise the cat is alive or dead it's a massive waveform and shinger said the cat is in

[01:38:18] Quantum terms both alive and dead simultaneously until you open the box and and observe either a dead cat or or a living cat that's scher's cat cat and again you there there's a there's a great description in the book of an experiment that I actually wasn't aware of this experiment that took place uh I believe it was off the coast of Spain in the

[01:38:45] Canary Islands correct um the experiment is very complicated but it actually illustrates this point a little more with a little more Nuance because of course a lay person listening to this is thinking what the hell are you two idiots talking about like this is a dumb story right but but the point is when you look at the path of these electrons or particles unobserved they are indeed behaving this way and this experiment I don't know if you want to go into the experiment if I'll I'll try yeah it's just it's it's so mindboggling give me a flashlight we can go into the cave right like um so it's called um delayed Choice Quantum eraser and I actually I I include the technical description of the experiment in the book because for the civilian it is just like absolute

[01:39:43] Madness I mean the words make no sense and it's it's describing the physical setup of the experiment with lasers and mirrors and telephone cable at fiber optics cable and you know um I mean and just as an example of like this is how far out there these scientists are getting that we don't even understand the language that they use to describe how they understand the universe so so there are things called entangled particles and entangled particles um are subatomic particles that affect each other instantaneously ly and have to do the same or corresponding things and they do that they they if you do something to one particle that's entangled with another particle the entangled particle reacts in the same or complimentary way instantly and instantly means faster than the speed of light and information cannot travel faster than the speed of light it can't travel one foot faster than the speed of light and it can't travel 50 billion light years faster than the speed of light and what they found is that entangled particles even on opposite sides of the universe if you do something to one the other entangled particle is affected instantaneously okay those are entangled particles that's how the universe universe works for some reason so they figured out a uh fish mechanism for sort of tricking the universe and what they do is they take entangled particles and you know I have no idea how they do this you know you you'd have to go to the original literature and you probably won't understand it because I S didn't but take it take it on faith from the physicist you take entangled particles and you fire one at a double slit in the classic double slit experiment unobserved and we know for sure that it goes through both slits at the same time time because it's unobserved we know that that's how it works and then you with a tiny delay you send its entangled twin through double slits and

[01:42:05] You observe it and it's forced be because of observation it's forced to go through one slit but now the universe has a problem because entangled particles have to do the same thing and we know that they've just done different things and again just so people are following us the reason the entangled particle has to pick a slit is because it's being observed right it's now in the quote unquote physical world again it's no longer a probability distribution it it's going to behave like things that are observed behave right pick a doorway one or the other but not both right meanwhile it's twin that was fired off an instant before was unobserved and so it remains as you say a probability distribution and physically goes through both slits at the same time and hits the strike plate on the other side with a classic wave form signature that physicists well know means it pass through both slits so when they when they observe the second entangled particle going through one slit as it has to because it's being observed and then they look at the results of the first particle that was unobserved and had to go through through both slits when they look at the strike plate it shows a signature of having only gone through one slit because entangled particles have to do the same thing but what this means is that Quantum not only did they infect each other instantaneously but effectively speaking the mechanism reached back in time and Chang the outcome of the first entangled particle it's delayed Choice quantum eration and what I say in the book is that if there is any I prefer the phrase uh post-death existence for the individual rather than afterlife it just is too imbued with uh a kind of hopeful vision of us in a hammock with a daer forever you know what I mean there just there's something a little too Pleasant about that post-death existence for the individual if there's anything to that um if there's anything to that idea

[01:44:23] I simply say in the book it would have to it it would have to work on a on a level of just sheer weirdness that delayed Choice Quantum eria exists like that's it's un totally unex physicist don't understand why the world I mean is there a chance that there is so if you go if you go back to Newton right like you think about Newtonian physics which explains everything we see right like we we see airplanes fly that doesn't make a lot of sense right if you were you know one of our ancestors saw that they wouldn't understand it but we can understand how an airplane flies that's

[01:45:00] Newtonian physics and of course what happened with the quantum Revolution um in the I guess the early part of the 20th century is physicists realize that Newtonian physics breaks down at the atomic level and you need new physics to explain what's happening there do physicists believe that what you're describing is to Quantum Theory what quantum theory was to Newtonian mechanics in other words is there now a third layer of physics that is as as as as as set free from what we understand today and and has yet to be described potentially honestly I'm not sure I wouldn't be surprised I mean the physicists themselves and the and the you know the sort of like fathers of all the grandfathers of all this like schinger and Einstein um were on to some degree or other many of them were sort of unnerved by this like the the results just didn't make sense in our sort of like because there's this other experiment right where Einstein basically comes to the conclusion that one of two things has to be true either particles are moving faster than the speed of light or they are containing within them deciding information neither could be true he sets out to prove it and the only way he can prove it is to violate something withheld in quantum theory itself and I believe it was through the photoelectric effect like yeah yeah yeah you know this is why by the way there is a fork in the road I had to choose between mathematics and physics and I chose math right like

[01:46:39] I at some point I was like I'm actually not smart enough to do quantum theory yeah and you know frankly it's a little I mean I found it a little unsettling a little scary I mean and I almost had this thought like whoa careful what we try to find out like is it is it possible you know as you approach the speed of I me this is like a hopelessly sort of ignorant metaphor in some ways but as you approach the speed of light Mass gets infinitely heavy and you can never get to the speed of light because it get as you approach INF becom infinite right exactly so you can't get there and I sort of had this this thought this sort of pedestrian thought like as we approach complete knowledge does the does the experimentation and the the the theories do they get increasingly inaccurate and misleading so that we never quite get there because if we get there if we have complete knowledge of everything does that destroy everything I mean is there an element of Consciousness can't fully understand

[01:47:38] Consciousness or it will not you know if it does it will it cannot sustain itself and you know that's just you know this just like thought experiment word play but it did it did sort of make me on a human level just be a little queasy like do we really I mean do we really want to interrogate God about how all this stuff works like I mean are we are you are you sure you want to know this right like you are you sure you want to understand delay Choice um Quantum eraser I mean I think there's two ways to think about this right the the first is would knowing this help us live better lives on this planet the answer is probably no but but again you could leave that to the choice of the individual U for me personally I think the answer is no I I think that um I'm

[01:48:26] I'm really happy as a simpleton um you know on the relative basis pretty dumb um you know I I function in form of you know pleasure and love and relationships and all those things um but where it becomes really unsettling is when you contemplate life or existence or nature matter whatever post life so that that to me is the part where it's very difficult to let this go which is you know if if if if if if my belief is that once I experience death as defined very clearly and very medically there is no existence and and and versus what if there no there might be something there even though we can't imagine what it is then that I don't know you could argue maybe maybe knowing that does make it easier to live today I I I this is this is where I just get wrapped up and and and usually end up putting my head in the sand after an hour of thinking about it and just go back to watching F1 videos on YouTube listen the sand isn't a bad place I mean

[01:49:36] J the um the a physicist named um Sir Arthur I think Arthur Edington yeah the one who observed the photo electric effect he observed he he basically validated Einstein's prediction that's right so he said about all these Mysteries um which were unsettling and perplexing all the physicists of the era you know around 100 years ago um and and into the 30s and 40s um he said I'm paraphrasing here was something like um uh something we don't understand is doing we know not what that was his ultimate evaluation of like what's going on in the universe I I misspoke by the way I said photo electri effect it was general relativity that he observed in

[01:50:23] South Africa in South Africa I think seeing the eclipse right with the eclipse exactly it bent the Rays of light as Einstein predicted and Einstein was great I mean you know he said look I mean if you want if you if you want to propose a theory what you must offer the scientific Community are the ways to disprove it yeah like if I'm wrong the numbers will these will be the numbers so investigate and if these are the numbers I'm wrong I'm going to tell you how to defeat my argument right I'm going to tell you how to do it and if you fail right then maybe my theory is right and so that's what he did with the eclipse and he predicted where the uh the star would be as it passed through I can't remember exactly what it whatever it was it was a it was the bending of light during an eclipse yeah which could only be seen because it was a complete solar eclipse right so a star that should be in one position should be in another position because of the bending of light and in fact if it's not in that position I'm wrong said Einstein right so Edington was one of the people that helped him confirm that by going to by the way is a nice little tie into everything do you know how Einstein died uh yes an abdominal aneurysm yeah that's right and he refused treatment yeah yeah he was like no he was in the 70s he's like no I'm I'm good um yeah uh so I think that to sort of answer your question about is this good for us or not um other than the completely abstract and terrifying maybe we don't want to know everything because the universe will collapse Into A Spacetime of zero radius or whatever the phrase is um uh for me it allow it sort of allowed open I mean I'm still an atheist meaning I don't God is not part of my daily practice it's not how I understand reality it's not God does not guide my decisions and my values um I'm a moral person in my own right and and and um and I and I do fine with it so God is not I so I am an atheist uh I don't really particularly like the term agnostic which I'm happy to talk about if you want meaning you feel you need to either or get off the pot with your your thinking sort of

[01:52:39] I mean I like put it in more human terms so if if you're in a happy marriage and you have no suspicions that anything is going on that would upset you about about your spouse uh at all and someone said you know is your wife cheating on you and you said well I I'm agnostic on that I don't know you wouldn't say that right I mean unless you actually had some reason to doubt right so when you say I'm agnostic about

[01:53:08] God what troubles me about that is that there's absolutely no evidence that your wife's cheating on you right there's absolutely no evidence that God exists right so if that's the case if there is some evidence she said she was going to the movies and she didn't go to the movies now I'm now I can say I'm agnostic right but until then until I've seen some evidence that God exists if I saw a little bit of evidence that God exists if I saw overwhelming proof I would be I would be a believer if I saw some evidence that God exists I would be agnostic and like well I'm on the jury and I don't know okay so you're not opposed to the term agnostic you're just saying you're not I think it's in I think it's inaccurate for the way most people know it I think Mo you think most people are in one camp or the other they're just not will to right and it's like the sort of like cheating spouse analogy like unless you have some reason to doubt your spouse you say no she's not cheating on me I have no reason to think that right no I don't believe in

[01:54:03] God I have no reason to think there is a God I've never seen evidence to the effect that there's a God right and if there was a little bit of evidence I'd be like hung jury like there could be maybe there is maybe there maybe she's cheating on maybe she's not maybe there's a God maybe there isn't a God that's truly agnostic I just don't know what would be the basis for that ambiguity well I think the challenge with the termin ology is um maybe that we don't have a clear definition of God and that for example many different religions will have many different versions of what a God is and then there are probably some people who um wouldn't subscribe to anything within an organized religion but would describe themselves still as spiritual and might still argue that there is a God but not you know the god kind of thing so it it gets so complicated but again that's why

[01:54:51] I wanted to separate away from that because again there is a really clear situation of none of that matters and we're still wrestling with the question at hand which is what does it mean to die on this planet what does it mean to die in this physical body that stops respiring to which you know we are rushing towards entropy right and so for me without the um the help or baggage of

[01:55:22] God however you want to think about it I was faced after this near-death experience with some very very puzzling um very very puzzling memories and uh specifically seeing my dead father in some form above me and um is it just neurochemistry yeah possibly right is there and again it would have to be at some Quantum level some post-death existence that we just don't understand for the first time in my life

[01:55:50] I would honestly say yeah possible right I'm agnostic on it and agnostic for specific reasons I actually have evidence right there's evidence on both sides you know like the jury it's a hung jury I don't know I can't I not I don't know beyond A Reasonable Doubt but the idea has been open to me that you know the the the that the suspect is possibly innocent right or for the court analogy like I maybe there is something right and so my book is divided into two sections what and if what happened to me and what if there were some post death existence just theoretically as a thought experiment how would it work there's almost certainly not I say in the book there's almost certainly not but if there were how would it work and that's where I sort of wound up in in quantum physics I had a hilarious conversation with some colleagues of my father who I sort of tracked down after um my near death experience guys who were very fond of my father and um you you know sort of half a generation younger than him half a generation older than me really really sweet guys and and uh we had lunch and I and I said guys I just this is what happened to me my dead father appeared above me and you know

[01:57:06] Miguel like what do you think he would think of this and you know the conversation went on um I mean know first of all just so you understand how unclear many physicists are with the idea of like what something romantic is my my my Rudolph Rudolfo um said said to me well your you know your father was a hopeless romantic I was like really like my mother that would be news for my mother right I mean they timed their they elop to San Francisco to get married and they timed it he timed it for to coincide with the weekend of the annual meeting of the um the American acoustical

[01:57:48] Society in San Francisco right so I was like really what makes you say that and he so there's a something a uh there's something called a Helm holes resonator in Acoustics right and uh so Rudolph said well he was deeply in love with the helm Hol resonator and talked about it constantly like oh got it okay all right yes hopeless romantic so so and know one point right after my parents were married and then these are the brains that come up with this kind of thing right um right after my parents were married she was cooking dinner and he was in an armchair this sort of 19 late 1950s marital Idol right like he's in the armchair in front of the fire reading she's cooking dinner and he's muttering to himself oh my God that is so beautiful that's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen that's just absolutely gorgeous and of course she's like what has gotten my new husband's attention in this way like what exactly is he looking at right so she tiptoes over you know I think probably fearing the worst and and he's the he has a a book open and the both pages are covered with numbers and equations and symbols right that's that's what's so beautiful to him like that was his brain right so these are the gentlemen it's his ilk that I have lunched with and um his his former colleagues and I said okay guys what are the odds just and I thought it was a rhetorical question right cuz I'm not a physicist so I assume this is a rhetorical question I was like really what are the odds that my dead father could appear above me in some form like while I'm dying like what are what are the odds right and to my like amazement

[01:59:31] Rudolph the helm Hol resonator guy looks up like up and he Strokes his chin and he's sort of like running the numbers right I was like oh my God is he actually calculating this like is that something you can calculate and he said yeah it's he said it's around and I'm trying going from memory from my book he said I think 10 Theus 60 something like that so one chance in a number that has 60 zeros after it right I was like what there's a number for this like what are you talking about he said well it's roughly the chance that all of the oxygen molecules in in the air of this room would just randomly through sort of stat from through statistical mechanics would just randomly collect in one corner of the room and asfixiate us almost impossible but it's theoretically possible right well likewise there probably the odd of your father rematerializing above you or roughly on that order of unlikely right I was like oh my God that's what we're dealing with like and so but then it turns out if you look at the odds of the universe existing they're it's way way more unlikely it's 10 to Theus 230 so one chance in a number that has 230 after it right so it's the chance of finding one grain of sand it's millions and millions of times less likely than finding one specific grain of sand in all the sand on the earth on the first try right something like 30 parameters have to be in very precise places for for a a physical Universe to exist the force of gravity all these all these sort of Arcane things that you know most humans don't know about uh and then for conscious life life to develop it's all almost infinitely unlikely and it's actually way more unlikely at least according to Rudolph it's way more unlikely that the Universe exists in the first place and we know that it does cuz we're here than my father appearing above me that's actually in the realm of chance like way more likely than the universe existing in the first place which we know it does right so in my book you know one of the things I say is like look my dead father above you know like that's the you know once you get past the stunt of the universe going from absolutely nothing to hundreds of millions of light years across in an amount of time that's too small to measure once you've pulled off that party trick you know the dead appearing above us in some Quantum form while we're you know passing through into their realm like yeah I can see that may you know we don't understand it but I can imagine that it's possible yeah I mean I think that's unfortunately where I find myself Sebastian is um because I at least have enough facility with numbers when I go through the exercise everything you just did coupled with even simpler things like just the existence of us like just let's just limit it to organic material um and I can't then I just have to accept the flaws in my own cerebral

[02:02:46] Machinery right which is I'm not smart enough to understand this stuff like I'm I'm not and I never will be like I don't understand Consciousness I can't explain Consciousness I cannot and I and I and I look at my dog and I think well he's conscious like he there is a feeling of being a dog like he knows what it's like to exist and then I look at a little roly poly and I think he's probably not conscious right like there probably isn't being a roly poly the way there's being a dog or being me but outside of those really really broad

[02:03:26] Corner edge cases like I can't explain it like not at all doesn't matter how much I read right I mean it's possible that um we understand reality as well as a dog understands a television screen right like just no concept of the of the The Wider mechanics The Wider reality The Wider context that produces is the flickering images that the dog sees on the screen that we see in reality there's a much vaster Colossus around it around that that produces what we see and we just we just don't have the equipment to understand that shinger um schroedinger's opinion was that there was a universal Consciousness and it was a sort of vaguely Buddhist idea and he felt that individuals that we as individuals are part of that Universal consciousness and sort of reunited with it when we die and you know his theory wasn't very articulated but that was his sort of

[02:04:27] General belief which and as was my father's and um there's a theory called biocentrism which is unprovable and undisprovable which basically holds that if it's true that Consciousness conscious observation creates the reality that it observes then the entire universe might have collapsed into its specific form from one enormous uh possibility um uh one enormous spectrum of possibility um with the arrival of conscious thought and that creates the universe that we're in in this sort of like snake eating its own tail way um and that Consciousness is part of the physical makeup of the universe at the quantum level the way gravity is uh in some in a ways that I don't quite understand this something called the higs boson which is the Manifest it is what manifests gravity in matter and that there might be something akin to that that is connected to Consciousness which gives rise to the physical universe that in turn allows for

[02:05:30] Consciousness it's hopelessly circular and the higs bosan has been observed I mean relatively recently this is in the last decade maybe maybe last 15 years y that's right it's been the first observation of this right so this this Force that's throughout the universe that is one of the basic reasons the universe can exist um it it it it is there because there's a subatomic particle called the higs bosan though maybe there's an equivalent for Consciousness I mean that this is all theorizing and biocentrism sort of focuses on that and that if that's true then our individual

[02:06:06] Consciousness mine yours all of ours is actually part of this sort of Colossus of of matter and Consciousness which is the Universe um not provable not disprovable but there is on the sort of level which is important not to leave behind um for me something close to a comforting thought in that that I mean the idea of being conscious like we are now for eternity like you die and then the real thing starts that lasts forever and there's no exit you can't kill yourself to get out of this deal right you are going to be conscious with whatever whatever that experience is and it may be horrific for for eternity thank you no like I'll take my long nap thank you I don't I don't I don't need that right so an afterlife an eternal afterlife isn't frankly that appealing but the annihilation of death is also quite terrifying and the idea that we're actually there's some sort of illd defined Consciousness that we return to and can manifest itself at these sort of threshold moments of life and death where the dead are maybe in some way sort of quote there with us like that to me is this sort of sweet spot and just comforting enough to allow us to face death but without this sort of like in my opinion implausible fantasy that we in a hammock with a dairy for eternity basically like this sort of oh how lovely the afterlife it's just one big long vacation like that sounds hellish also and so if we if you think about it like this if we knew for sure if we could prove if there was actual proof and evidence that there was an afterlife like somehow we proved it and it went on forever that you're alive for these troubled 70 80 years and then whatever happened your afterlife starts and you're just cruising for eternity it strips all the meaning all the dignity all the struggle all of the victory out of those 70 years of struggle and Joy and Pain and sor and everything it's like don't worry about it's just 70 years in an eternity like don't worry about it right The Eternity is going to start soon enough there's an afterlife it really strips from us the value of the one thing we don't do know exists which is our own experience right now in this moment this continuity of moments right that would be a Pity to have that stripped away from us as hard as we work in this place like really like don't do that this is all we know we get so and um but on the other hand if we could prove that there was no afterlife we're completely biological beings right God or no God you could have a Creator God there's like you know what we're going to have kangaroos and turtles and worms and humans and everything else but they're biological when they die that's it there's no afterlife there's no soul there's no nothing you're dead right yeah it's just it's just carbon transfer right exactly so with or without a God if that I mean if there was a God that decided that totally plausible if we could prove that you would know absolutely that when you die you are over right it's as if and not only that it's as if you never happened it's zero it's nothing right the infinite black pit that might be so psychologically troubling that we actually have trouble

[02:09:37] Lo leading those 70 Li 70 years living those 70 years with dignity right and um so in this where we're at is this ambiguity no we you know we can't prove there is or isn't an afterlife there might be there's some reason to hope so we don't have to be too scared but there's also some reason to think there might not be so make the M make the most of today because that's all we know we'll get like this sweet spot of ambiguity is actually perfectly attuned to giving this making this life both psychologically survivable and meaningful right so that's to me that is like another of the to borrow a

[02:10:20] Christian word another of the sort of Miracles of all this like wow you really landed it God like if you're out there you really landed Us in just the right spot to absolutely maximize the the meaningfulness of this thing we do have which is life yeah you wrote it you wrote something so beautiful uh near the end of the book without death life does not require

[02:10:43] Focus or courage or Choice without death life is just an extraordinary stunt that won't stop which is a terrifying idea in its own right and um anything that won't stop is a terrifying idea basically so after I finished the book I I read this extraordinary story about DVI the the great Russian writer and had I read it when I was doing the book I probably would have put it in there but it gives me a chance to tell a nice story during conversations like this so um when he was in his 20s he was a bit of a political radical and he had a bunch of radical friends and they would sit around they had like a a circle like an intellectual Circle they would sit around and they talk about stuff and they talk about for example freeing the

[02:11:30] Surfs right outrageous ideas like that right it's in the 1840s and you know of course the same basically the same conversation was happening in the United States about the slaves about slavery so the Zar Nicholas the first I think it was was not um particularly pleased by this talk and his police rounded these boys up and threw him in jail and they spent eight years in jail uh uh eight I'm sorry eight months in jail and it wasn't a particularly serious crime right so they were getting their wrists slapped but no one was particularly worried about anything and then finally after eight months they were um shown to the door of the prison and loaded onto a carriage and you know they just assumed they were going to be driven to the court and discharged and released to their families the nightmare is over and so they're bouncing along through the streets and instead of going to the court they're driven to a city square and they're tied to posts and a firing squad is lined up in front of them they've had to make the transition psychologically from going home to my family to I'm going to die in a few minutes right they had to make that transition almost instantaneously right so they're tied to posts and the order is given for the soldiers to charge their weapons and level them and aim and Dusty and his buddies are waiting for the command fire when their chest will be torn open by musket balls and so what happened was this was theater it was sadistic cruel theater it was a mock execution just to scare them and a rider galloped into the square just in time uh and said thear forgives them and they were untied and sent to a penal colony in in Siberia for a while but they survived two of the men um who went through this of the six men or so went through this were in insane for the rest of their lives they could not take that's what I was saying about the truth like no afterlife like I can't bear that thought they could not the the the the the um the unfiltered vision of infinity starting 30 seconds from now right with without any warmup without any time to adjust you have cancer you're going to die in a year nothing just from life to death in in some minutes was so um psychologically traumatizing that they were deranged for the rest of their lives they never psychologically recovered Dusty did and he took that experience and put it into some of this amazing work but what we know because of him we know what the world the nearly hallucinatory quality that the word that reality takes on when you go when you do this transition abruptly from I'm alive yay to oh my God I'm going to be dead in a minute like what does the world look like Through The Eyes of someone who's experiencing that right and um this is what he said he said he looked out and he saw sunlight glinting off the roof the steeple of a church and he thought to himself in in moments

[02:14:56] I'm going to become part of this I'll be part of the sunlight I'm going to be I'm going to become part of all things and if I somehow survive this I will I will Le I lead I live the rest of my life turning every moment into a an Infinity right and he did survive it and he took the wisdom of that Vision which of course if we just stopped erased our sort of our the the sort of busy slates of our brains and just stopped and looked around it's just the insane surreal miracle that anything is the New

[02:15:38] York City subway a tree the ocean your foot you know whatever I mean just look at any of it you like oh my God that exists and I'm here to see it are you are you kid K like that was what he got and if you can't live like that but if you can incorporate a little bit of that sort of strangeness of you know if it looks St the strangeness of that Vision allows for for awe and gratitude right and when that Vision becomes um when you become accustomed to it right when it becomes an everyday thing I mean there's a problem with long marriage with marriage sometimes right you're like oh yeah you fall in love this person's amazing and then you adjust and they're just another person and you love them whatever but that that sort of awe that you that this person is with you like if you can keep that in your marriage you have a good marriage if you can keep that in your life you have a good life and that's that was the the blessing that came with the curse of what Dusty went through and I've gotten a little bit of that in my life and you know frankly it's um it changed my life in a way that religion often changes religion often changes people's lives

[02:16:46] I'm not religious it's changed it in an equivalent way like a profound gratitud ude not just for my life as I am living it but the fact that I have a life at all and that any of us do so does that mean now the answer to the question that your wife posed for you is that indeed you would you would you would go through all of this again yes I would as painful as it is to say and I wonder if dski would I'm guessing he would and those poor guys who never recovered they wouldn't you know but um and I was I you know I had access to a really good shrink I'm a very loving family like you know and I be I frankly it was it was touch and go for a while I mean I mean it could have really um you know I still have a sort of weird

[02:17:39] Panic anxiety disorder around health issues and I'm like prone to the imagining that like something's catastrophically wrong with me in a kind of paranoid Woody Allen kind of way like oh my God I'm sure I've got cancer like I mean we everyone does that a little bit I think but you know it really opened up the Gateway for me it's extremely unpleasant and I know that paranoid feeling comes flooding into me and it's a direct result of of almost dying on a beautiful June day you know and so it's not without its costs but um because I've got I'm blessed blessed to have some incredibly wonderful beautiful things going for me in my life like I was able to sort of pull it off

[02:18:16] Sebastian thank you very much again the book is is is really really special um um not just as a story but if you're if you're if you're willing as the reader I think to um to to let yourself really contemplate and imagine what what's being described and accept the um impossibility of of being able to understand it and being able to resolve it and being able to to to to find a proof um it certainly offers more questions than answers but but that's you know that's what makes it worth living right thank you I'm so glad that you uh read it and and enjoyed it so much and you invited me on what a wonderful conversation I really enjoyed it thank you Sebastian thank you [Music]
