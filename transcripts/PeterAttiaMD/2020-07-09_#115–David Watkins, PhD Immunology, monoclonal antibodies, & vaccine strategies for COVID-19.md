[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast of my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode I guess this week is Professor David Watkins David is a professor of pathology at the George Washington University Medical School where he recently relocated from the University of Miami there's an interesting story about his recent relocation which we touch on at the opening part of this interview dr.

[00:01:05] Watkins was elected a fellow of the American Academy of microbiology and was vice chair of research in pathology at the University of Miami prior to this recent transition his early work focused on the similarities between the nonhuman primate simian immunodeficiency virus SIV and HIV in fact SIV is a great animal model for HIV which is where David has spent the bulk of his career and we touch on that quite a bit in this episode because there's a lot you can learn about what may or may not work with corona virus obviously the purpose of this discussion was really to talk about corona virus but really what

[00:01:41] I find great about this episode is the immunology 101 discussion that I wanted to open with and we did open with but we went deeper than I expected we would go I just can't say enough about that I think if you are trying to make sense of what you are hearing about this vaccine versus that vaccine versus this test for antibodies versus that test for antibodies if that stuff isn't crystal clear to you you're gonna want to listen to this and even if you don't care about some of the other stuff we get into in the more nuanced science later on I think the first part of this interview will appeal to anybody who's trying to understand immunology and doesn't know the difference between the innate system versus the adaptive system the cellular system versus the humoral system I think the show notes for this are going to be really helpful because again there's just so much content here David does just a great job explaining kind of the overall different categories of vaccines the inactivated virus is the attenuated viruses etc and we go into what the examples are of each of these and then finally David talks about what he is most excited about on this front which is the potential for monoclonal antibodies so I hope you enjoyed this episode and it's not going to be the last one on this topic but this one's an important one if you want to understand anything that we go into deeper so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with David Watkins David thank you so much for making time to sit down after you just barely had a chance to settle into Washington DC my pleasure

[00:03:15] I'm still not fully settled in and it's been a series of disasters that have occurred you know move here to Washington but hopefully we will get over those things pretty quickly yeah I didn't know about this until recently would you be comfortable sharing with people the major disaster that is I mean if not for the fact that you were laughing I certainly wouldn't have a smile on my face cuz it's so sad but well our freezer truck traveling from Miami to

[00:03:46] Washington DC with it maybe explain to folks that you've just left the University of Miami yeah yeah so I've been at the University of Miami for 10 years and recently decided to move to GW Medical School and so I needed to transport all of my samples that I have accumulated over probably 30 years of research and they came up in a single truck in a variety of freezers that were plugged into the truck and there were a couple of liquid nitrogen's freezes in that truck and in North Carolina the truck caught fire and destroyed all of those samples so over a hundred thousand samples were right in this truck so we're now thinking and working with the insurance company as to how to regenerate the most important samples in that truck so yes said we had a little bit of a setback so David you and I have met through this very interesting project we're trying to get off the ground working with a bunch of really smart people and we won't get too much into that project specifically but the point for the listener is some of my colleagues and I reached out to you on the basis of your expertise in terms of understanding coronaviruses and specifically around a question that pertains to how long could we expect the immunity of an infected person to last so if a person gets infected and is fortunate enough to survive which fortunately is the majority of people what does that say about their ability to survive a subsequent infection so a lot of pads and roads led to David

[00:05:21] Watkins so help me understand a little bit about your path I know you were born in Uganda and I know that you studied the Zika virus my now you have a great interest clinically in HIV but kind of connect some dots there for me in terms of where the interest in immunology came from so yes I was born in Uganda and then I grew up in the West Indies until

[00:05:40] I was 11 and and I think it was in the West Indies that I developed a keen interest in nature and all things tropical really because it was very happy period in my life my mother decided I needed to have a proper education so I went to an all-boys British boarding school in South Wales which was a pretty traumatic event coming from the color and the beauty and the freedom of the West Indies to a all-boys boarding school however I survived that but I think that what I got from my time in the West Indies was a deep appreciation of nature an especially tropical nature the diversity so I studied biology and that was what was my great passion and I did a degree undergraduate degree in botany and zoology and then went to the United

[00:06:36] States to study immunology really the evolution of the immune system and then went to Boston and worked on the HIV epidemic in the long term but initially in the short term worked on the evolution of the immune response so how did first of all frogs make an immune response and then how did monkeys making new responses so I was a am really an evolutionary biologist and then HIV came along and this is the most dramatic example of evolution is that I certainly have ever seen where the virus populations can change after infection in two weeks where the infecting virus can be essentially removed and a new virus appears under pressure from the immune response and then because of my roots in the West Indies I had the occasion to visit Brazil about twenty years ago and realized that I was back in the West

[00:07:47] Indies because of the neotropical fauna were exactly the same so I was back home and since then I've fallen in love with Brazil and learned how to speak Portuguese and now study many viruses that are tropical diseases like seeker and dengue so I guess that's how I came to develop my interest in tropical diseases well I share your love for Brazil though clearly not your ability to speak to language nor probably the frequency but you've been there but it is a place I hold very special and I'm very bummed to probably not be making a trip this fall there I was planning to take my wife potentially my daughter to Sao Paulo so

[00:08:28] I do look forward to getting back to Brazil though because I agree with you it is a very very special place on this planet by the way before we get into something I mean you said the evolutionary thing I a question popped into my mind that may or may not be relevant but just out of pure curiosity when you think about our evolution humans people point to the development of language as a big step function change in our development or developmental changes in the brain some of which of course enabled that change in language or standing upright all of these various things that represented not just linear but sort of logarithmic changes again not that they occurred very quickly in real time over a log scale they look to have occurred more quickly what was the biggest change in the evolution of the immune system as you studied it I think probably the advent of the adaptive immune response because many many different animals have innate immune responses that are incredibly important but the evolution of T and B cells that then allowed the immune system to have create a memory to respond to pathogens and in the end is the basis for vaccination which as you know is the public health measure that is saved more human lives than any other public health measure so yeah probably the adaptive immune response and of course that's what I'm interested in - it's a little bit of bias here well when did that take place how long ago did we acquire that out of just the innate system we certainly know that amphibians have T and B cells and make antibody responses and T cell responses so this occurred well before that branch of the animal kingdom that's amazing I actually would not have guessed that I would have guessed it was more recent than that but that's pretty impressive and it speaks to obviously the importance of it so let's build off what you just said and give people a really good primer on immunology I love this topic as well

[00:10:35] David and I studied immunology but in a different lens I studied it through the cancer lens so mostly focused on the cellular branch of the adaptive system could you walk people through kind of a diagram that people might keep in their minds eye which says you first would bifurcate the immune system as innate and adaptive and then you would further bifurcate the adaptive system cellular and humoral so maybe talk about what those two branch points mean let's say people get infected with influenza virus so even coronavirus what happens is that the virus enters a cell through a reset and the virus can't replicate by itself and needs to get into that cell and replicate and then the virus starts replicating produces copies of itself which are sent out into the blood and infect other cells that infection event triggers the innate immune response there are sensors inside cells that will then trigger the production of interferons which will then start to turn on the immune system including the adaptive immune system and the adaptive immune system is it really has two major arms the T cells and the B cells I'm going to talk a little bit about the B cell response for a moment because that is what has really fascinated me for the last two or three years and we're getting influenza infection our lymph nodes under our jaws swell up and the question is what's going on and what's happening there is that pieces of the virus are being presented to the B cells and the B cells have receptors on their surface and they recognize this piece of the virus and they bind very weakly but that stimulates a cell to divide every time the cell divides and makes an error in copying this receptor on the cell surface and some of those errors make that antibody less able to bind and that visa will die but some make it better able to bind the antigen and this process goes on and on and so the B cells start growing and the lymph nodes start swelling and during this process even though you're born with a set of B cell genes by the time you are 60 you may end up with a different set of b-cell genes through this beautiful evolution in fact this after

[00:13:16] HIV evolution the face of the immune response is one of the most beautiful examples of evolution that I've ever seen so what happens is this receptor on the B cell starts mutating and that is selected for and you arrive at a antibody that now binds to the antigen with very high affinity can you tell people the difference between an antibody and an antigen and what some of the different antibodies are absolutely antigen simply means a piece of the virus so when the virus comes in to the body it's not replicating and be picked up by a macrophage which will engulf it and then put it back out on the surface of that cell or on dendritic cells it's all very mechanical and I think it's important that people understand this right these things you're talking about like these are physical proteins this is a virus that invades a cell I think for people who don't understand immunology it seems like a bit of a black box but the way you're explaining it if people understand that you're talking about a physical piece of the virus a tangible piece of virus makes its way into these cells that present the antigens I mean it becomes actually a lot less intimidating I think to understand what you're saying it's simply a piece of the virus antigen perhaps is a piece of joggin that we shouldn't use so just a small piece of the virus and that's out on the surface of this cell but it's enough for us to know it's not us that's the key point here is it's an antigen not just because it's a piece of the virus it's an antigen because our body has some capacity to realize hey that thing is foreign isn't that sort of the key piece of this yes it's a recognition of something that's not self that is what stimulates these B cells to start replicating and then on the surface of the B cells is another protein which you can think of as a a shape or a structure and this interacts with the piece of the virus on the other cell which is presenting that to the B cell and then the B cell replicates and every time it does it makes a mistake and it gets either a better or a receptor that's not so good but those better receptors then start binding to the piece of the virus with greater affinity and can basically now bind very tightly to the piece of the virus so then they circulate in the body in your blood and in a year's time you have another infection from the same virus and this time those antibodies that they're already pre-made they bind to that virus and they stop it infecting cells and you're protective and again that's the basis of vaccination if I've axon ate somebody I give them the virus and that gets presented to the B cells they make these antibodies and they make them better every time they see a piece of the virus and so even though you hadn't been infected with the virus you've been vaccinated the next time you see live virus these antibodies will bind to the live virus and prevented infecting cells let's talk about a virus that doesn't really mutate much from season to season

[00:17:00] I don't know pick a rotavirus or something like that in that first round of iterative replication of the B cell where it's basically going through an evolutionary process on its own to quote-unquote naturally select for the best antibodies how many times what's the speed with which it is able to replicate until it starts to converge on picking the optimal antibody these cells are replicating and a matter of hours but with a new virus may after a week or two you'll see antibodies that will be able to neutralize the virus now it neutralizes a bit of a technical term I'm going to try to explain now you'll get many antibodies that will bind to the virus but they won't necessarily neutralize the virus because they won't stop it infecting cells they'll bind to it but they won't affect its ability to infect cells and so the key antibody that most of us are most interested in are these neutralizing antibodies and that is that they were bind to a part of the virus and prevent that part of the virus getting into a cell so let's take an example of the new corona virus that has a spike on its surface part of that spike is a region that binds to its receptor on a human cell and if you have an antibody that covers up that area that will stop infection of a human cell that's a neutralizing anybody if you have an antibody that binds to another region of the spike that's not involved in binding Co the receptor on the human cell it won't necessarily prevent infection so David let me pause you for a sec because this is such an important point that I want to make sure everybody understands it and I want to throw in an orthogonal concept which is most people when they start hearing about antibodies they think about these serology tests because they're all over the news and they start to say wait antibody I've heard of that that's IgG IgM or maybe they remember hearing about IgA so I want to now have you explain a little bit what's the difference between IgG

[00:19:28] IgM let's just keep those two simple and then talk about how knowing that you have those antibodies doesn't necessarily mean they're neutralizing and vice versa so how do we reconcile that nomenclature and explain I guess going back to the beginning what does immunoglobulin G or IgG refer - versus IgA etc there are many different types of antibodies that can be used at different mucosal surfaces and can be used for various different tasks in the body so when you get infected let's say you've got infected with dengue virus the first antibody that comes up is the

[00:20:07] IgM antibody so if you have a test that says your iga-positive the dengue that means it's a very recent infection those IgM antibodies tail off over time maybe two months three months not everybody is the same then come up your IgG antibodies now these are the antibodies that will contain your neutralizing antibodies eventually although IgM antibodies can also carry out neutralization that is they combine to reason regions of the virus and prevent infection

[00:20:40] IgA antibodies are generally found at mucosal surface or obviously are very good for mucosal infections so let's focus mostly on the IgG and the IgM so you said the IgM is the first antibody that typically shows up and then the IgG comes up as the IgM is trailing off what determines when a person makes those in that first exposure if they are neutralizing or not neutralizing in other words could you take two people who are exposed to the same virus who both managed to successfully fight off the virus but do so with a different proportion of neutralizing antibodies and therefore maintain a memory of different neutralizing antibodies that would render one more versus less successful years later there is actually an enormous variability in the way that people make neutralizing antibodies there's a paper under consideration coronavirus at the moment from a very very good lab Rockefeller they looked at

[00:21:44] I think it was 70 individuals and they look for the presence of neutralizing antibodies and they found that almost 20% of them did not make neutralizing antibodies so they could be enormous differences in the way that we make neutralizing antibodies I'm sorry I just wanna make sure I understand it does that imply your saying 20 percent of individuals who were cero positive for exposure to coronavirus so meaning on analyse attest or some other point of care test they showed the presence of IgG or IgM in the blood but when you did a special assay to see if those antibodies would actually neutralize the virus they did not neutralize the virus that's exactly correct furthermore there was a great aggradation in loyalty of these individuals to make neutralizing antibodies one or two of them made neutralizing anybody's at very high titers and what that means is that you can dilute their ceará and it will still neutralize the virus at a 1 to 5,000 dilution whereas most people it's one to a hundred dilution can still neutralize the virus so there was an enormous variation in well levels of neutralizing any presence made now I know the sample isn't large but did they speculate on whether that directly factored into the clinical response of those patients not sure not sure because the next question it begs is those 20 patients that did not have neutralizing antibodies how did they thwart the virus or did they not is that the point not necessarily they could have had a lower inoculum of infection they could have been asymptomatic I would have to go back to the data to make a correlation between those two things but I think what it says is that there is enormous variability in the B cell response to this virus and that means for me at least those individuals that didn't make a good neutralizing antibody response can they be reinfected and can they be reinfected how soon after their initial infection we know that people infected with other corona viruses like the cold virus for example can be repeatedly infected with the same virus so one of the big issues for me at least is if you've been infected can you be infected again that ability to be infected does it correlate with neutralizing antibodies in the serum which is a likely thought but maybe completely wrong remember you also have t-cells that I haven't talked about

[00:24:44] I'm saving those guys in the back for a moment we're not stuff in the V cell discussion yet I should say that I spent 15 years of my life working on T cells and only more recently I have been working on B cells and I'm sure there's some b-cell experts there will be listening to this and laughing at me but this is my understanding of b-cell response so another question I think digging deeper into this is and not to put you on the spot but do you know if there has been a study done where they've taken and look at many many subjects who were vaccine naive given them a vaccine so human challenge vaccine for a virus that does not have huge genetic drift so that would exclude influenza vaccine and then done what you've proposed which is followed those people post vaccination for measurement of neutralizing antibodies because at least in that situation you would have a standardized inoculum presumably and then you could sort of try to adjust for other host factors such as age but you could maybe say look you have four different cohorts of neutralizing response but they generally correlate to factors X Y or Z do you know if that's been done it may well have been done -

[00:25:57] I'm not aware of the results but I can tell you of a study that we've done in collaboration with asthma Callas in South Paulo and one of them Alda in fiocruz in Rio we looked at the immune response to one of the most successful vaccines so that is the 17d yellow fever vaccine so this is an attenuated vaccine that was to arrive from somebody in

[00:26:23] Africa had the yellow fever us then put into monkeys and then cultured in the laboratory for many many rounds of tissue culture and what emanated from this was a virus that was weakened and we call that an attenuated virus this has many differences genetically from the original virus in Africa but if I inject this into a human the virus will replicate and it will do all of those things that I talked about inertia - normally innate immune response then the adaptive your R T and B cells generated and you will have antibodies generated against the vaccine virus and in fact the best way to make a vaccine is often attenuating or weakening the original virus now there's a few problems with the other fever virus vaccine and that is that there are some people whose immune responses cannot handle the attenuated virus and some of these people will actually one in 300,000 will get sick from the virus and some of those people will die from the virus especially if your own there is some risk associated with it and for perspective I think measles mumps chicken pox would be other examples of live attenuated viruses at but this one is something about this one the 17d is its efficacy is great what is the approximate efficacy the one thing about humans is they're all different they're all different ages and as you get older your immune responses are not as good but the study that we did with Myrna and asthma shows that all of those vaccinated individuals will make beautiful neutralizing antibody responses against 17d one in five times so i can dilute their serum one in five thousand it'll still stop the virus from infecting cells beautiful immune responses but if we take a virus out of a dead monkey that's died of yellow fever simply preserved not the same so one or two individuals didn't make any responses against the wild type primary

[00:28:48] ISIL because these viruses that come right out of a monkey for example are incredibly well adapted to replicating in the monkey and have not been adapted to replicate in tissue culture but was there anything special about the gentleman in Africa who was the person who from whom the yellow fever virus was first pulled or was it just that happened to be a person there like was there some characteristic about this person that's seated well I don't think there was anything special about this individual but the virus is so changed the vaccine bars from that original virus that engenders immune responses that may not be able to recognize a pathogenic primary Iceland and this primary isolate is incredibly important to test any vaccine against but what we found is that there was a large range in ability of these people that were vaccinated to respond to the wild type virus so I want to come back to a really deep discussion actually on viruses and take what you've just talked about which is these attenuated viruses and put them in the context of RNA and mRNA viruses the inactivated virus is and also some viruses for which we have not yet come up with vaccines RSV at least not safely

[00:30:15] HIV and hepatitis C I want to come back and talk about that but I think to do so we have to go back to these B cells in these pesky T cells so I think you've done an amazing job at least to me clarifying some of the nuances around B cells and I just want to make sure I'm playing it back correctly which is the B cells arrived pretty soon after that innate response takes place if anything they're probably sped up by the cytokine storm that follows the innate response they go through this sort of evolutionary replicative cycle until they convert the perfect antigen and if we're lucky they preserve that memory so the B cells that reside in our bone marrow for years and years later will always hold on to the dear memory of what the final best antigen was and if we get reinfected it's a neutralizing antibody if we're lucky that goes back and gets it but the risk that we don't yet understand is why do some people not make neutralizing antibodies and of course what's the implication of that clinically is that a fair synthesis yeah I mean the only addition I would make to that is that once the antibodies the b-cells are we call it affinity matured that is they get better and better at binding to the piece of virus that they attach to and this occurs in the lymph nodes where the architecture is very important because we've got t-cells that are absolutely necessary to help them develop in those lymph nodes but then they exit the lymph nodes about 7 to 14 days later and then they become either memory B cells which are very small B cells that circulate or they go into the bone marrow where they become these big plasma cells which essentially become the factories of antibodies so if you have laid down in your bone marrow a plasma cell we call them plasma cells they are large cells that are spewing out antibodies and if one of those cells is making considerable amounts of neutralizing antibodies you will be protected likely from an infection with that virus that you've just seen for a long long time now that will vary from virus to virus but that's essentially the ontogeny and evolution of the B cell respond David you've consistently referred to the delusions that you do when you're actually looking for basically a way to quantify neutralizing antibodies I'm gonna take it to mean then that when I either poke a person's finger or draw blood and look at the quantification of IgG or IGM that we are typically now seeing as common test that people are doing for coronavirus we are not distinguishing whether or not neutralizing antibodies are present that is not an assay that is capable of determining this is that correct absolutely you're not neutralizing antibodies at all you're looking at the quantity of antibody that is bound to the piece of virus that you're using in that assay and that doesn't tell you if those antibodies can bind to the region of the spike protein on the surface of the virus that is critical in binding to the receptor on the human cells for entry and the value of those antibodies that are not neutralizing not clear at all but we do know that antibodies that neutralize are really really very important that's really the goal of any of the vaccine efforts that are underway at the moment it's the generate heat realizing antibodies admit something kind of embarrassing I did not know that until I met you and Stanley Perlman so just to put that in perspective up until two months ago I did not know that the antibodies we measured in a person's serum whether it be two coronavirus which we're doing now or those that I've looked at my entire medical career when

[00:34:29] I check a patient's antibody levels whether it be to see if they had varicella-zoster and they're at risk for shingles or whether they had epstein-barr or way like you pick any virus I had no clue that every time I order that lab test on a patient and I was looking at their eye gg's and IgM levels that I was not necessarily being a short of immunity because I had no insight into whether those were neutralizing or not and that must be the analogy would be you know making this up as I go but like a cardiologist looking at a patient's lipid numbers but realizing that no matter what these numbers say 20% of the time potentially this has no bearing on anything because it's not actually the lipid that matters you're measuring the lipid level in a cell as opposed to the lipid level in an lipoprotein which is the one responsible for disease like it's such a stark wake-up call to me I'm guessing

[00:35:25] I'm not the first person to be shocked by this and the fact that we still don't have clinical assays to do this only laboratory assays suggest it's very difficult to do this or at least not cost effective to just routinely screen patients for neutralizing anybody's it's quite a difficult to say that requires and you're incubating the patient's plasma or serum with the actual virus then plating it out over cells and then watching the virus infect the cells over the next 2 3 4 5 6 days depending on the virus so what you're looking for is a serum that will block the virus of interest from infecting the sounds so it's not trivial but we standardly do it for HIV for Zika for dengue in a laboratory and we'll soon be doing it for the new corona virus so let's now pivot to that second arm of the adaptive immune system this highly highly advanced immune system where you actually spent the majority of your career which is talking about these t-cells first well how does a t-cell differ from a b-cell how do we define it as a different cell they're clearly both very advanced types of immune cells well

[00:36:45] I lost something that I know something about I used to think that the most important cell in the body was the cytotoxic T cell and worse than that I used to think that the heart had one function and that is to pump T cells around I see the immunology meetings now with pictures of hearts and just you know one function will pump T cells around the lungs only function provides cellular respiration for T cells the kidneys only function filter T cells there's a whole t-shirt industry for you yeah so but I have to admit that I love the cytotoxic T cell it's called cd8 t-cell it is a cell of immense power probably one of the most empowering you themselves you have we can see it's awesome power in HIV by the way just for the record I'm kind of partial to cd4 we'll come back to it especially cd4 cd25 but we'll get to that later I'm less interested in cd4 cell as an oppression the cd8 cells are really rare reaction so we made a discovery in the early days of HIV in the animal model of

[00:38:08] HIV infection which is of SIV simian immunodeficiency virus I remember this very clearly we infected monkeys with a simian immunodeficiency virus and then we looked at the virus two weeks later and two weeks later we couldn't find the virus we infected those monkeys with there was virus replicating in the blood but it was a new virus and it had changed that at one site and I remember when the student brought in the sequence of the new virus and it had one change and I said you've made an error we need to get this checked by other labs because I couldn't believe it but what had happened is that how many base pairs by the way just to put in it had two or three changes it depends this is an RNA or DNA virus this is an RNA virus so what is HIV which is our neighbors so and it's notoriously error-prone when it copies itself but what we discovered it happened is that the monkey had made a massive t-cell response directed against eight amino acids and an amino acid is a you think of it like a string of pearls and this was eight pearls this t-cell response had wiped out the initial infective virus so that all that was present replicating in that animal now was a virus that had mutations in that area so we you see dramatic effects like this you understand the power of the cytotoxic t-cell so basically these CT outs had been generated and I a CTL cytotoxic t-lymphocytes is the abbreviation they had wiped out the virus that I put up to these monkeys and more recently you've seen this in cancer there was a paper published in the New England Journal where if I remember the paper correctly this patient had a melanoma and then she had a massive she tried every treatment and she had a massive tumor under her left breast I think it was she was treated with an antibody that turns the t-cells back on and in a matter of weeks she now had a hole in her chest because the t-cells have just gone in wiped out the tumor so to me this is the awesome power of these cd8 t-cells and that's what I initially fell in love with was cd8 t-cells in the immune system but after spending 20 years trying to make a vaccine against HIV based on inducing t-cell responses and failed spectacularly at that and then recently discovered the power and the beauty of B some responses and antibody evolution which is the same way that the virus had evolved in the face of this cd8 t-cell onslaught is the same way that a antibody evolves when it affinity matures to become the perfect fit binding antibody there's two sides of the same coin let's explain a little bit to how that CTL works the cancer example of course is near and dear to my heart but let's use another viral example to explain how the CTL or the cd8 t-cell is basically instructed to destroy in the same way that the B cell makes neutralizing antibodies that ultimately destroy the so this is a different method of killing so let's walk the listener through that it's completely different method okay so again a virus let's use HIV as the example of virus will enter a cell and within 24 hours we'll make thousands of copies of itself and will burst the infected cell and in the case of HIV these are cd4 cells the virus enters the cell 24 hours later hundreds and thousands of copies of this virus and now released into the blood now an antibody can interact to stop the virus from getting into the cell although that's proven to be very difficult in

[00:42:43] HIV and we can talk about that later but once that virus is in the cell it cannot do anything the antibody cannot get inside the cell so the game's over as far as an antibody is concerned this is where cd8 t-cells come in sorry and is that just because HIV has so much replicative power or is it because just by some stroke of horrible horrible luck the cell that HIV uses to replicate happens to be the general of the cellular immune system the cd4 cell like what what is it about that that is so ironically bad well I mean most viruses will get into any cell that has their receptor on the surface of but in the case of HIV this receptor the cd4 receptors on surface of cd4 cells these helper cells but in any event an antibody whether it's in apathy lleol cell that's been infected or a cd4 cell once that infection event is over an antibody can do nothing because antibody can't get into that cell so what we need is a cell that can recognize an infected cell and before it releases all the progeny virus so I like to think of a infected cell as a virus Factory you need to shut that virus factory down so how do you get another cell to recognize uninfected some because that cell can't go around killing cells indiscriminately in your body it has to be able to recognize and infect it from an uninfected cell and that is what a cd8 t-cell does in a very elegant way when the virus binds the receptor and get into the cell it starts to make its own proteins in that cell then we have these buckets called MHC molecules major histocompatibility complex molecules these buckets sample what's on the inside of the cell and they put it up on the surface of the cell and in the buckets on the cell surface are pieces of the virus in an infected cell in a normal cell they're normal proteins of normal cellular machinery that goes on inside the cell so a killer t-cell will come along and it will see let's say it has ten cells in front of it five of them have been infected with HIV and five of them have not so it'll move over them it has on its surface a t-cell receptor that looks like an antibody it'll move over and look at the buckets and say okay I've got five uninfected cells here I'm not going to kill these guys but then it comes to an HIV infected cell and it sees a piece of the virus in one of these buckets and it goes crazy it binds to that and then it blows holes in that infected cell and it closes the factory down so these buckets full of pieces of

[00:46:11] HIV I like flags on the surface of an infected cell that say kill me because you don't I'm gonna release a thousand or two virus particles into the infected person's blood so that is what a cd8 t-cell does and it plays a critically important role in almost any viral infection and in fact you need both arms of the immune system although I've waxed lyrically about the B cell response and the beauty of antibodies and their ability to neutralize sometimes they don't neutralize every virus that comes in you need your cd8 T cells which are such efficient killers to come in and kill those virus factories and so as with anything you need multiple approaches to control and infection and it also depends on the quantity of virus that's in the system as well but these cd8 T cells are really exquisitely good at closing down virus factories and that's really their main job now we can't generate beautiful neutralizing antibodies or these incredibly powerful cd8 cells without helper cells that are critically important in providing a milieu for the development of the cd8 killer cells and for the B cells and of course the most dramatic example of the importance of cd4 cells is HIV when a person gets infected what happens is we get massive virus replication initially because there's no immune response and what's happening during that first two or three weeks is the innate immune response is being turned on and that's generating the adaptive immune response about day seven today for T income the cd8 T cells and they destroy everything they can but unfortunately they destroy the first virus they saw but the virus has been making errors and so they're now by the time you're two weeks out you have so many copies of different viruses in that infected individual and it's simple Darwinian evolution the cd8 t-cells will search and destroy every infected cell that they can but BB one that has a mutation in that strength of eight pearls that the cd8 t-cells are seeing in that bucket on the surface of the infected cell those cd8 t-cells cannot recognize that that cell will start spewing out thousands and thousands of copies of violence and that will become the new virus in the individual and so does that mean that every patient who's infected with HIV will ultimately converge to a mutation that at least can bit contains that section it would if everybody had the same buckets so it's different for different patients right so the MHC is incredibly interesting because it has so much diversity so your image she didn't is a different than mine and if you needed a skin graft you couldn't have a skin graft for me variety of reasons including the fact that your t-cells would recognize my skin is firmed because of the MHC molecules on the surface and just Slough it off yeah I mean the t-cells are really I mean not just as you've described at their role in treating viruses or combating viruses but at their role in treating cancer in transplantation human transplantation so organ rejection their role can't be overstated the example you gave of the woman with melanoma is a very extreme one but there's reasonable evidence that most people are walking around have cancerous cells in them ie cells that do not respond to normal cell cycle growth and yet they will not go on to develop cancer any time soon and that's a great testament to the cd8 cell which is able to recognize those cancer cells as non-self which is the key determinant and to eradicate them and of course this is exactly the reason we have to give patients who have been given a transplanted organ immune suppressed drugs it's really suppressing this arm of the immune system to prevent them from doing their job which is saying hey that kidney or that skin graft or whatever is not me and therefore it needs to be eradicated I share your enthusiasm for this David I find this to be some of the most interesting biology in the human system and so it's kind of remarkable it's funny I still don't think I really understand why certain viruses in particular HIV and Hep C are not vaccinated against and I think maybe naively I assumed that the problem with

[00:51:14] HIV was the rate of mutation and the fact that it was primarily targeting the cd4 cell is that are those effectively the two reasons that we don't have a vaccine against HIV most of our vaccines are based on immunizing an individual so that they develop neutralizing antibodies there are very few t-cell based vaccines although it's likely that t-cells play a very very important role in the vaccination process but it's those neutralizing antibodies that when you first get infected they come in and they stop infection your t-cells can come in and clean up after you but they are really the basis of almost all licensed vaccines so the first attempt was to make neutralizing antibodies by vaccination and the problem is it's very difficult to make a neutralizing antibody against HIV and SIV just for structural reasons meaning I'll explain that that's not to say that neutralizing antibodies aren't generated so let's go back to this infected person or a monkey massive virus replication you can have ten to a hundred million copies of virus per ml in those first two or three weeks it's a massive population size and they're almost all of them are different so you've got enormous variability and that's the basis for selection so in comes your cd8 t-cell responses that kills everything it can and now what you're left with growing out are these new viruses that have CTL escape mutants your antibody response then kicks in along the lines that we discuss and patients will make a neutralizing antibody response plus guess what happens the virus escapes so you go through these cycles of escape generation of new antibody responses but there are rare individuals well the point also is that there is enormous variability in HIV reason for the enormous variability you've already guessed and that is this error-prone mechanism of generating new variants coupled with the fact that HIV unlike most viruses a chronic virus so the virus constantly gets selected upon by the immune response and we've done these experiments we can infect a monkey with a clone virus so we know entire sequence we can then get that virus a year later and look at the variation in the virus an outside envelope which is the piece of the virus on the surface of the virus for entry all of the variation is selected for by CTLs by killer cells on an envelope it's all selected for my antibodies so this virus because it's chronic is so variable so when you talk about HIV you're basically talking about lots of different HIV so here's the question for a vaccinologist how am I going to make a vaccine that

[00:54:46] I'm gonna give to a hundred people in Boston but those hundred people are all be exposed to different viruses if I vaccinate them yellow fever I know pretty much what the sequence will be but here I've got a hugely diverse set of viruses that I'll be challenged with the second problem is that today nobody has been able to generate by vaccination a neutralizing antibody against HIV meaning every vaccine that has been given to patients even if it generates antibodies they fail to actually neutralize the virus exactly that's the big problem I can vaccinate monkeys and generate huge levels of antibodies that bind none of them neutralize the virus that I'm going to challenge the monkeys with that's another huge problem the reason for that is that this virus this envelope first of all they have very few copies of envelope on the surface of a

[00:55:48] HIV Varia that envelope is a protein but it's covered in a Shield of sugars so it's hard to get in to bind to the regions of the envelope that are important for binding the cd4 and getting into the cell so this virus is unlike anything I've ever seen it is so so difficult to generate neutralizing antibody responses because of the biology of the virus and the biology by that I mean both the fact that it's covered in this sugar shield and if I've accidentally humans they're going to be challenged with a bunch of different viruses that have all gone through selection and mutation and a different one from the other and this could be as different as different as 30 percent of their structure it's a very very difficult issue and the fortunate news here is that on a drug development standpoint the progress has been remarkable I mean the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid 90s is a game-changer I mean it is unbelievable if you just take a retro perspective look for 40 years at HIV mortality matched against exposure to or capacity to receive heart highly active antiretroviral therapy it's I don't want to say overnight but it's like within a span of two years you took something that was uniformly fatal and you've rendered it a chronic disease that is - no way diminish the struggle of it but having friends with HIV and watching how long they can live with t-cell counts that would have in the past rendered them dead within months it's on the bad news I think you came up against a virus with the most super powers of any virus the good news is it's a very chronic killer on the medicine side there were opportunities to keep it at bay am I being overly optimistic there no no and I think the bigger point you raise is that as we stand here with the corona virus epidemic three months old I think we should have faith that science will find a solution to this and I'll go back 30 years and I'm in a lab at Harvard at the primate center there and I'm hearing about these people in San Francisco with these lesions and they're dying and I remember we don't know what's causing this bacterium is it drugs is it a virus nobody could isolate virus from these individuals and I'm at the primate center and monkeys are dying as well and

[00:58:37] Ronda Rousey is at the primate center the new in the primate center isolated a virus that looked very similar to HIV and that was the birth of the animal model that we were able to pace therapies on so we discovered it was a virus we thought well okay then we can use condoms to protect protect from it okay that's good that's a behavioral measure then came a ZT and that was not until the late 80s that that insight I can't remember the exact time wall maybe a bit earlier right potentially mid-80s but okay but so now we have the first measure against the button well social distancing that's right and then AZT was a repurposed drug and I remember where you could see the virus loads coming down and then they came back up of course because the virus escaped then raishin Ozzy at Emory discovered a couple of drugs that if you put these together or in combination with other drugs you now had a treatment and this was the game-changer the rest of us are working on vaccines and immune responses and what we're learning is that it's so difficult this virus can escape from just about any immune response we throw at it and then you have the groundbreaking prep studies pre exposure prophylaxis where people take a drug

[01:00:04] Truvada in this case every day and they simply don't get infected and if everybody who sexually active takes Truvada the epidemic of new infections is over we still have a large number of people already infected and they need to get on treatment but in that example science found a solution to the epidemic although it wasn't a vaccine because of the unique nature of the virus and I think it's important to understand that every virus presents its own particular set of challenges and HIV presented us as vaccine ologists with a set of challenges which i think frankly are going to be insurmountable and thankfully we have these drugs that are highly effective that's not to say that we don't need an HIV vaccine we need an

[01:01:02] HIV vaccine and this virus is in fact 'add 75 million people to give you some perspective on the new Coronas virus infection numbers it's killed 32 million people again we're not even close to that with corona virus but I think the general lessons that we learned from the HIV epidemic and many of us the worked in the HIV epidemic are now better to deal with a coronavirus because we've learned a lot of valuable lessons from

[01:01:36] HIV now how much do you know about hepatitis C it has a similar story in that I remember 20 years ago or a little longer than that maybe 20 to 23 years ago I'm in medical school I'm sitting in my immunology 101 class and they're saying just so you understand there will never be a vaccine for this virus don't think about that anymore and not going into that field I never did think about it anymore but I did notice that by the way a couple of years ago we got a drug that now eradicate shep see and it's a lot like the HIV story which is we still don't have a vaccine I don't understand why I'm hoping you might be able to offer an insight there but there was a pretty successful workaround because prior to that David it was predicted that Hep C was going to be accounting for something to the tune of 70% of liver transplants absolutely Hep C is a virus that replicates to enormous levels even higher than HIV generates lots and lots of variants and is going to be very very has enormous variability even though it's a different family of viruses but it's a virus it's going to be very very difficult to find a vaccine for but luckily the same man raishin

[01:02:45] Ossie PhD biochemist would discover the first two drugs he was involved in the discovery of these first drugs that not only treat Hep C but they cure Hep C which is the key if the virus is gone now even with our best antiretroviral drug therapies we're still not curing the infected individuals and of course that's a huge and important area of research my view on this is now I want to be careful I don't say something that

[01:03:16] I'm gonna think sounds really stupid after the fact but I'm gonna go ahead and say it anyway it's quite possible there has been no greater advancement in medicine in the past ten years than the drugs that cure Hep C when you think about the scale of what that has done it is enormous and to put this in perspective when I was in residency and

[01:03:35] I did my training in surgery so we were always exposed to sharps and things like that I was far far more afraid of hepatitis C HIV for the following reason Hep B so the big three our Hep B Hep C and HIV those are the things that are blood-borne transmission you're gonna be worried about them all of them have devastating consequences

[01:03:57] Pepsi probably having the quickest consequences if you are untreated happy we could vaccinate against HIV was a lousy virus in terms of transmission a solid needle going through a double glove is pretty low transmission but Hep C was a very transmissible virus if my memory serves me correctly it's at least an order of magnitude more transmissible than HIV and no treatment no vaccine so

[01:04:26] I mean I remember being scared senseless of Hep C and to think that as you said today I think it's about a thirty to sixty day course of a medication albeit a very expensive one and you take somebody who's got a forty to fifty percent chance of dying of liver failure in a decade and you cure them I mean this is unbelievable science is truly wonderful I want to bring it back to your point which is we are still early in this coronavirus situation and there's probably a greater effort on this than there is on anything else that we've talked about at least relative to the moment in time when it was perceived to be an issue

[01:05:04] I completely agree and I think we have to put it in the context of other pandemics like HIV like the 1918 flu for example where fifty to a hundred million people likely died from influenza I think we're much better able to mount a rapid response I think that this virus will be easier to develop a vaccine against but I should put in a disclaimer here and that is that I have been wrong about every prediction I've made about this new corona virus since January where I thought that maybe this would be like it very very bad flu and I was completely wrong but do you think you are wrong about that David I mean that's still not entirely clear to me that this isn't just three to five times worse than a flu how much worse do you think it is I don't think that a really bad flu has closed down the world economy like this

[01:06:10] I'm sorry yes no no okay I'm speaking from a purely biologics standpoint not from a sort of policy standpoint but from a biology standpoint my reading of the data is that when you really look at the IFR and not focus on the CFR and you age stratify this is a disease that depending on your age is maybe twice as bad as the flu is maybe five times maybe eight times as bad as the flu but it's not 25 times as bad as the flute how do you read the literature again remember the caveat when I first started looking at this and I looked at some of the crucial data I thought yeah this is going to be 5 to 10 times worse than seasonal flu I think it's more likely 10 times worse but I think it also depends on what sort of pre-existing conditions that you have diabetes obesity and I think there are lots of things that we don't understand that can predispose you to this I mean what about the amount of virus that you see initially so I think there's a lot of things that we need to have a lot of humility about understanding in this new virus but I am buoyed by the fact that the evidence for escape there is some but it's logs less than we see with HIV this is not a chronic virus so what means that it is possible to generate a antibody response it's been difficult in the monkey studies to understand the exact titer of the neutralizing antibody response but the key experiments are putting these vaccine concepts into humans and looking at their neutralizing antibody response but we don't know what levels of neutralizing antibody responses will be sufficient to prevent infection and I think that's a very important issue we don't know that so we don't know what percentage we don't know the frequency of people who would develop them and we don't know the duration that they will last duration I think is a key issue with respect to infected people and with respect to vaccines because you've got to make a neutralizing response and then you've got to keep that neutralizing response up to a level where it will prevent infection but for me the most exciting hope that we have for treating this virus is neutralizing antibodies delivered as monoclonal antibodies and maybe I should explain that concept because it really is a beautiful concept so let's go back to the example I gave of yellow fever five acts eight a hundred people with this yellow fever virus that's attenuated let's say ninety percent of them will make a response against the vaccine virus twenty percent of them won't make a response against the wild type virus the virus that's circulated so they're going to be susceptible to infection but at the other end you're gonna have three or four individuals gonna make wonderful antibody responses against the vaccine virus and the wild type virus so those individuals what if I could take that blood and give it to everybody else well there's lots of problems with that and that was proposed very early via the lingo of convalescent serum which is we give concentrated amounts of convalescent serum to people who are sick maybe we give diluted amounts of convalescent serum to people who are not sick but at high risk because they presumably wouldn't need as many antibodies to fight off the initial response if exposed right so I've got these three people that are super respond instead of making beautiful antibody responses that neutralize the virus or what I'm going to go in and do is I'm going to get their memory b-cells and I'm gonna clone the genes of those antibodies that remember have been through beautiful process of affinity maturation and changed and now bind very well to the piece of virus that prevents the virus from getting inside the cell so they neutralize so I'm gonna get these neutralizing antibodies and I'm gonna clone them and then I'm gonna test them against the virus and then I'm gonna test them in animal models and then I'm gonna grow them up in large vats and I'm gonna go into a nursing home let's say it's hundred people and I'm gonna give them each an injection of this monoclonal antibody and that is going to prevent infection how long will that last it depends it depends on the dose you give and it depends on how you genetically engineer that antibody so you can put mutations into that antibody where that antibody will last for three to six months at levels that should prevent infection to me this is the most exciting aspect and the most hopeful treatment for coronavirus and it's a new type of vaccinology if you will and it's

[01:11:42] I think the way forward for the vaccine field is to get those individuals that make the best antibody responses clone their best antibodies grow them up in vats and then distribute that to the people that need it and this can be used for prevention and it can be used for treatment and and one of the things that we're doing at the moment is in the setting of yellow fever they've been at yellow fever outbreaks in Brazil and my colleague ESPA Callas has been managing patients in Sao Paulo and they come in and you don't know if they're going to die or they going to live and 40% of these people are dying and there's nothing we can do about it so the exciting idea is to inject them with an antibody that neutralizes the virus and stops it replicating can we save their lives and as you saw from what happened with Ebola last fall simple injection of a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the virus after infection saved many many people's lives drop the death rate from I think 50 percent to about 15 percent and that's the part I want to actually double click on here a little bit so let's go back and review we spent a lot of time talking about vaccines and the goal of a vaccine for the most part is a b-cell strategy which is put in some form of attenuated inactivated virus or maybe just it's RNAi we'll come back to all the full means but you do something that elicits an immune response that is appropriate if we're lucky we not only get the appropriate immune response but it generates these specific antibodies called neutralizing antibodies those are the ones that matter we go off and if we're again if we're lucky we get beautiful big fat effector B cells that turn into plasma cells they hang out in bone marrow they are just sitting there primed and ready and if you see this infection again it's not even going to be a blip on the radar because the antibodies are right there right away to neutralize you're saying great in parallel here's another strategy we figure out who the Olympic champions of making neutralizing antibodies are and using recombinant engineering recombinant DNA technology we basically make copies of these things effectively synthetic copies of these things and inject them into people so that even if their b-cells are out to lunch it doesn't matter because it's the substrate or it's really the product of the b-cell that is sitting there waiting now the issues with this are as follows one they don't last forever so you said get three to six months out of this so if we said look this will be something that we would use to target the most high risk people presumably the elderly those with the greatest number of comorbidities and healthcare workers and

[01:14:35] I think then there's also tiers of other people who are working in close proximity to others etc etc you would come up with a list of people who probably need to receive these monoclonal antibodies on some regular frequency say two to four to per year how feasible is that in the context of what it takes to basically scale and deliver vaccines is it on par with that in terms of challenge is it more difficult where does it rank no I mean let's not forget that a cheap vaccine is really the best way to go with all of this and we need this for

[01:15:11] HIV there's not a doubt in my mind that we need this for HIV and if we can get that for coronavirus that will be great and I think one of these vaccine approaches will result in durable neutralizing antibodies well then you can do a prime boost with a different vaccine to boost your immune responses but there are certain people who don't do so well with vaccines and that's the elderly they don't make such robust immune responses and in fact it's this population that you might vaccinate with these new vaccines against coronavirus but they may not make such robust responses so using a monoclonal antibody

[01:15:58] I think or a combination of monoclonal antibodies would be the way to go in this population if we can increase the herd immunity in the younger people by vaccination therefore reducing the number of transmission events then that would decrease transmission to the elderly but as we've learned with HIV we need to use lots of different approaches to repeat this virus so initially we use condoms we have drugs and we can use drugs to prevent infection so the same thing will be with corona virus we need drugs we need social distancing we need vaccines but the point with regard to is this feasible is the following is as follows

[01:16:46] Humira is one of the most prescribed drugs that we have today that's a monoclonal antibody that's repeatedly given to people so I think that the advent of monoclonal antibody is going to be very very important to treat infectious diseases and in fact it may be the way of the future there's a trial going on now using monoclonal antibodies that neutralize HIV to see if it can prevent infection in Africa and it's going to be very very interesting where did they get the neutralizing antibodies in the first place given that so few people if any would generate them absolutely right that's an excellent question so one of my colleagues Dennis

[01:17:33] Burton at Scripps was instrumental and a pioneer in this area so they developed these huge cohorts so after about five to ten years a small number of individuals make antibodies that could neutralize not only their own virus but they neutralize many other different viruses and what this is is that they're buying two conserved regions on the envelope and by binding to those conserved regions on the envelope they'll prevent infection so that's how these very rare antibodies were isolated and Dennis was amongst the first to clone and express these and test them in monkey and animal models and then subsequently many different antibodies that are what we call broadly neutralizing so it's important to understand we have neutralizing antibodies that people infected with HIV will make neutralizing antibodies but the virus that escapes and that neutralizing antibody will be peculiar to their own virus but then later on as the virus evolves and the antibody evolves along with it they will generate what we call broadly neutralizing antibodies and those are the key antibodies those can not only neutralize their own virus but everybody else's and so that's how they isolated those and that was a massive breakthrough for the

[01:19:06] HIV vaccine treatment field David coming back to this vaccine issue you've touched on kind of one of the pillars of vaccine development which is using the attenuated virus it's weakened and again the example that you used there of yellow fever being a very successful one and again other very successful ones would be measles mumps and varicella-zoster on the inactivated virus side so these are viruses that can't do anything but you still have the entire coat of the virus that's given polio hepatitis A and rabies would be the sort of flagship stories there those two categories of either inactivated or attenuate are the lion's share of our vaccines I mean I know that the spike proteins did Hep B and I think maybe HPV

[01:19:55] I think so but most of the current approaches to coronavirus vaccines are not looking at the inactivated or attenuated strategies are they or am I just miss reading it because all of the stories that we're reading about the companies whether it be Pfizer the Oxford example Moderne example which i think is getting far more attention than it deserves I mean they're all looking at other sort of newer approaches of taking DNA or mRNA from these viruses or

[01:20:22] Spike proteins directly so is it just that that's the way technology is going and this is the first time we're seeing an all-hands-on-deck fire drill for a vaccine development or is it that there's something about inactivated versions of corona viruses or attenuated versions that scares us and I'm going to give you an example very early on Ronda Rousey is at Harvard

[01:20:47] Medical School the man who isolated the first simian immunodeficiency virus and the subsequent clones of that virus and really as a pioneer in this field and instance some tremendous work he discovered that if you attenuate that virus SIV by knocking out a piece of math and you vaccinate you infect animals the virus replicates but it's weak it then goes away to a very low level of replication but if you come back with the wild type virus 20 weeks later those animals

[01:21:24] I mean this is the best vaccine that we have and so the argument would be well let's go into Africa and vaccinate everybody with us well there's a couple of problems it was noticed that monkeys that were given this Neph attenuated virus many the years later started developing some clinical signs SIV infection it had repaired itself and was now pathogenic in fact we did an experiment where we took attenuated virus infected monkeys and then we challenged them with a different virus and we got some level of protection but what we saw was a few animals that had very very high virus though - were not protected at all the incoming virus had recombined with a vaccine virus to form an entirely new virus that was highly pathogenic a remarkable story we couldn't understand why a couple of these animals had these huge virus loads or what we sequence the virus was a climber between the incoming challenge virus so and and I think it's also based on the issue that development of vaccines is very very difficult and you have to be very very careful before going to thousands and millions of people with whatever vaccine construct you might have and that is part of the problem in developing vaccines but every way to make a vaccine is being tried at the moment the Oxford approach is to use a chimp adenovirus to express the spiked protein of the corona virus and it's going to be very interesting to see what sort of neutralizing antibodies that vaccine generates in humans do they test that David in certain or - do they test for that in phase one even though the purpose of phase one in humans is safety given what's at stake do they at least use the phase one to confirm that when I stick a piece of

[01:23:37] Spike protein into this defective adenovirus and give it to even a hundred humans just to make sure it doesn't cause any acute toxicity oh by the way I can at least find a couple of neutralizing antibodies and if I can't I better question whether we're gonna move ahead I guess what I would say is I would hope that they would be doing that but again it depends on what sort of titer is being induced by these antibodies by these vaccines what's the neutralizing titer and not necessarily just in monkeys in humans because in the end that's the only experiment that we truly care about and then how long does that antibody titer stay there but in this case remember what we're trying to do is not necessarily provide sterilizing immunity which is what we really needed to do in the case of HIV we're trying to knock down initial virus inoculum to a level where it doesn't cause symptoms and also reduces the amount of transmission and so the goal for this vaccine is not the same as an HIV vaccine if you will where we were trying to provide sterilizing immunity because once HIV starts replicating it spawns the necessary mutations to escape from any sort of immune response but if we can knock down the amount of virus in people that challenged with the virus after vaccination and it prevents them from going to the ICU prevents them reduces the days that they are infectious that for me is a game and so the goal of an

[01:25:23] HIV vaccine in the corona virus vaccine are quite different you've also studied Zika extensively and I know that that ties into your love of Brazil is there anything that you've learned through your years of studying Zika both in its epidemiology and its immunology that factors into how you think about coronavirus either optimistically or pessimistically secret virus had its own special set of issues and that is that

[01:25:52] Zika virus infecting you and me it not really going to cause much of an issue the problem is is if it infects pregnant women the legacy of Zika virus in South America is far greater than we could have ever envisaged there are many children walking around today that don't look as if they're unusual but because this virus infects brain tissue they will have many many deficits neurological deficits so that had its own set of issues I think a vaccine against Zika virus again faces the same problems that you need to induce neutralizing antibodies that come beatable but in the end we decided to take the approach to make antibodies and this is a collaboration that we had with

[01:26:52] Dennis Burton to make antibodies that we could inject into monkeys and prevent infection so if you're a pregnant woman and you wanted to have a baby when there's a Zika outbreak if we gave you these neutralizing antibodies would that prevent infection and in fact we were able to show in monkeys that a combination of antibodies completely gave sterilizing immunity to those monkeys they couldn't be infected with

[01:27:24] Zika virus now we the same experiment on pregnant monkeys that were already infected so he treated them at a three with a monoclonal antibody and it was a very small number of monkeys but we did not prevent transmission to the fetus so in that case we faithful so again it depends on the biology of the virus what you need to do to ameliorate suffering from that virus as to the approach that you might take yeah I think that's actually a very helpful explanation David because it really frames for me and the listener why you don't need a vaccine here that is perfect it has to be good enough it has to have neutralizing antibodies that's non-negotiable if you don't have that it's all for show and so what who cares how many eye gg's you have if they can't neutralize but what you have to do is reduce the viral load because one it reduces the transmission and two the viral load is proportional to the damage so more virus is more entry through cells that bear the ACE to receptor presumably is also more of a cytokine storm so you get more of the immune modulation and let's assume either through some combination of monoclonal antibodies or effective vaccines you can reduce the viral load upon first contact by 7080 percent that could have a commensurate reduction in mortality and spread and all of a sudden you know I want to come back to something that you brought up earlier which is I think it's unfair to compare Tsarskoe v2 to influenza because influenza meaning the resistance to influenza has many advantages and that is that healthcare workers are all vaccinated against it and so are the elderly each year now that doesn't mean it's necessarily always an effective vaccine but you know your enemy you know where they are and you're ready for them and I think a lot of the damage we saw out of the gate with corona virus was nosocomial it was transmission within hospitals which also probably means higher viral loads and so that becomes yet another advantage to a corona virus vaccine even if it is not perfect because the flu vaccine is never perfect but it's good enough to do all those things you said and I like this idea of you've got a few patients that are extra high risk and you bolster on to the vaccine with the monoclonal antibodies especially if this ends up having a seasonal component to it which

[01:29:53] I guess we're not going to know for a while then even be more targeted in your therapy I'm a huge fan of monoclonal antibodies in fact that's what we're doing in our is trying to develop monoclonal antibodies against both this virus and you know that they're going to be new viruses down the road so I think that we have to be a bit smarter now this is not the first SARS virus we've seen in the last 20 years so need to try to anticipate the next one and I think that monoclonal antibodies for me are the way forward to treat almost all infectious disease to prevent and treat and they're a logical extension of a vaccine we're simply taking from the best responders the best antibodies and we're now distributing that to everybody because everybody genetically were not able to make those robust and highly specific and high binding neutralizing antibodies so there's an internal beauty to the idea as well it's just the new vaccinology if you will well I'm glad to hear that these approaches are going on in parallel again I'm not privy to all of it I certainly see sort of the five to ten large vaccine efforts but again they're generally on the DNA or mrna side and and but hopefully there is at least some effort on the inactivated side as you point out the attenuated is the dye sia stove them all so it has the probably the potential to do the best and I agree with you completely David that my greatest hope in all of this is that people don't forget about it

[01:31:29] I think it's left a big enough shock that people aren't going to forget about it but lots of smart people were sounding alarms on this after some of the recent pandemics where they were near misses this one obviously was not a near miss in some ways it is in terms of you know this could have been a lot worse right you pointed it out if Tsarskoe v2 was ten times more deadly if it was on par with the h1n1 of 1918 I mean it's hard to imagine what that would do in a world that is this connected it's not something I give a lot of thought to because it's so devastating no I completely agree with you if this virus had the W shaped curve of the 1918 flu that is a killed they young and then went down and then came up between the ages of 20 and 40 came down and then when again with older people this would for me have been a horrendous horrendous pandemic so we're very lucky in that sense the other message that I think I'd like to give when I was a young scientist

[01:32:36] I always thought oh this is the approach this is the single approach and as I age I think the message is guys try everything that you can we need everybody's approaches and one of them is going to work better than another what we need a combination of all of these approaches so for example eyes that they Co yes a t-cell based vaccine is the way forward because of neutralizing antibody vaccine is not going to work against HIV Wow

[01:33:06] I was completely wrong as usual but in this sense let's try all the different vaccine approaches and in the end the ultimate purveyor is putting them into humans and then seeing if they're effective very famous vaccinologist one stood up at a meeting we were talking about monkey date and of course I was working in monkeys and I thought it wasn't important and it's rude not really and he said look David human data trumps everything and he was correct right I couldn't agree more and I think that extends beyond immunology and vaccinology into every aspect of human health with that David I want to thank you for your generosity not just of course with this interview which has been great but also the work that you've been doing on the project that we're working on collectively with that huge team and obviously in the midst of such and what can only be described as very disappointing and upsetting loss of your life's work as you transferred your lab from Miami to Washington DC one to maintain your sense of humor about it and and to to just keep sort of working on the problem it's really a remarkable example for someone like me who can easily get frustrated frankly when existential crises hit it's a real pleasure to talk to you and hopefully that we can embark upon this study and see whether a person that has had a corona virus can be reinfected left to me is a very very important issue thanks so much
