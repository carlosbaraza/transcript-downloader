## Description

Original release date: 11/5/2018

In this episode, David A. Sinclair, Ph.D., a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, provides insight into why we age and how to slow its effects based on his remarkable work on the role of sirtuins and NAD in health and diseases. He also presents the case that stabilizing the epigenetic landscape may be the linchpin in counteracting aging and disease.

We discuss:
-How and why David moved from Australia to Lenny Guarente’s lab at MIT [7:30];
-Sirtuins and aging [15:00];
-A series of experiments elucidating the mechanisms of sirtuins [20:45];

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of the interview with David Sinclair:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Harvard genetics professor David Sinclair discussing his pioneering work on sirtuins, aging, and longevity. The conversation covers his early research at MIT, the discovery of resveratrol, NAD+ biology, and current developments in longevity science. Sinclair shares insights about his current research on fertility, epigenetics, and his unified theory of aging.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Sirtuins are NAD-dependent deacetylases that play crucial roles in DNA repair and gene silencing [22:00]
- NAD levels decline with age, affecting multiple cellular processes [1:33:18]
- Resveratrol extends lifespan in mice on high-fat diets by ~20-25% [51:43]
- NMN and NR are NAD precursors with different properties and stability [1:09:51]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider taking resveratrol with fatty foods for better absorption [1:00:52]
- Start with lower doses when combining multiple longevity compounds [1:00:31]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Resveratrol: ~1g daily (Sinclair's personal protocol) [1:00:31]
- Metformin: 1-1.5g daily (Sinclair's protocol) [1:00:31]
- NMN: Discussed as NAD precursor [1:09:51]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"I've seen things you wouldn't believe... we've put all seven sirtuin genes into a mouse and fed them NMN... and interestingly there are additive effects." [1:32:53]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms by which sirtuins regulate fertility?
2. How do different tissues prioritize NAD utilization?
3. What is the optimal timing for starting longevity interventions?

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD comm

[00:00:41] everyone welcome to this week's edition of the Peter Athiya Drive I'm Peter dia this week my guest is Professor David Sinclair he's a professor in the department of genetics at Harvard Medical School and he is the co-director of the Paul F Glenn Center for the biological mechanisms of Aging David hails from Australia that'll take you about 10 seconds into our interview to figure out he did his PhD in molecular genetics at the University of

[00:01:09] New South Wales and Sydney and it was at that time that he met the man that would go on to become his mentor we talk a lot about him and this is a guy Lenny who's actually come up on other podcast so I won't get into him now but nevertheless David met Lenny and decided he wanted to come to MIT to study with him which is what he did and david has gone on to become one of the pioneers in a particular field of aging that focuses on a class of molecules known as sirtuins I'm sure many of you have heard of sirtuins but you might not entirely be clear on what sirtuins are I won't obviously make any attempt to do that here in the intro because we spend so much time talking about that during this episode the other thing that David is really quite famous for is his role in the discovery of a molecule or class of molecules that stimulate sirtuins and by the time you get through this episode you will understand why that may be a desirable thing to do and among these the most famous is one called resveratrol and of course resveratrol came to fame probably a little over a decade ago when it was noted at least in one study in one type of animal model to promote a longevity phenotype and of course what really made it interesting at least for the lay press was that ristretto tall is found in very low concentrations in the skin of grapes and therefore the logic went hey grapes make wine wine contains a sterile wine makes you live longer hallelujah the French paradox has been resolved slight spoiler alert that's not true but we get into the whys that might be the case this episode we only had when I say only meaning we had less than two hours but like has happened in other podcasts including the one with Rhonda

[00:02:51] Patrick after we closed the podcast because I wanted to be respectful of David's time he had to catch a flight to New York right after we spoke this interview took place in Boston we ended up talking for another 15 minutes and unfortunately that 15 minutes was some of the most intense detailed nuanced discussions of it and I left thinking gosh I wish we had more time to talk so

[00:03:11] I suspect David and I will speak again David has a book coming out next year and I think that'll provide another great opportunity to sit back down with him in this episode we talked a lot about his postdoc at MIT he came out of a powerhouse lab that has produced other notable folks that including folks we've already interviewed like Matt Kay

[00:03:29] Berlin and folks we've talked about like Brian Kennedy we talked about his contribution to the understanding of sirtuins which was something that was coming out of Lenny's lab and David really picked that up and ran with it what are these things what do they do what's their role in aging DNA repair gene silencing we go over all this stuff in detail we talk a lot about nad and its precursors specifically something called n MN so if you are listening to this and you are in the camp of trying to understand how to make heads or tails of nad and our n MN I think this episode will be helpful tragically it was not until 24 hours after we did this episode that I ran into George LASIK on an airplane who mentioned to me a paper by

[00:04:14] Josh Rabinowitz in Cell Metabolism that came out about a month before we did this interview that we will link to that I think makes a very compelling case for the futility of orally administered of these precursors and that would have been a really interesting discussion to have with David because of his expertise in this so at some point I'll probably want to interview Josh and we'll go into that in really detail because again unless you've been up in the Himalayas hunting Yeti you're probably aware that these are kind of the hottest supplements out there we talk a lot about nad levels what do these things mean where does it go where is it produced we again as I alluded to above talked about resveratrol and its potential in life extension and we talked about the connection then between sirtuins and nad we talked about his rationale for what he does so David is actually very open about you know kind of the stuff that he does personally including the fact that he takes resveratrol and metformin and nmn himself we also go into the differences between some of these molecules and again allude a little bit to his book there's a lot of stuff in here again sometimes it gets technical sometimes it doesn't the show notes as always will provide a lot of help so if you have any questions about papers we reference the likelihood that they're in the show notes is actually quite high also if you haven't signed up for our weekly email list and you wouldn't mind getting an email from me once a week

[00:05:32] I suggest you head on over to the website Pia MD comm and sign up again my promise to you is to make it as non lame as possible and finally if you are enjoying these podcasts please head on over to iTunes and write a review there and again I would hope that you like the podcast and leave a positive review but

[00:05:50] I guess in the spirit of getting as much feedback as possible if you don't like it and you have something to say that we can do to make it better that's probably not an unreasonable place to leave that kind of feedback so with all that said please welcome to my interview with Professor David Sinclair good afternoon

[00:06:06] David nice to be here thank you for making time today I gathered only by the commotion in this very busy place where in that there's a lot going on here and making time to speak with somebody as inconsequential as I am is a big ask so I am incredibly grateful I'm pleased to be on we were introduced by a mutual friend who's no stranger to people listening to this because I've had him on before David Sabatini and maybe a month ago maybe a little more than that

[00:06:33] I said David you know I really want to know more about sirtuins and who do you recommend that I speak with and he said well I think David Sinclair would be fect so he reached out to you and you very graciously agreed to speak so again III thank you for that and I'm really excited to talk about something that I know very little about as you will undoubtedly learn in the next hour or so well yeah it's kind of David know yeah you know and probably the listeners though as well he's a bit of a superstar it's not it's kind of him I'll have to do you know same I know it for that but no honestly it's really great to be on because I I know you delve into the details of the science more than anyone

[00:07:09] I've heard and I'm excited to be able to share that with listener well yeah that's that's the part that's got me excited so a lot of times I've listened to talks that you've given and I can tell you're I don't want to use they were dumbing it down but you're you know you're speaking to an audience where you realize that if you go too far in the weeds there they're gonna miss the point and so I found myself watching talks you've given on YouTube going I wish he would elaborate on that point in that point and hey it may be that I don't I don't understand it myself let's see so

[00:07:37] I think just for a bit of background I know you did your undergrad your PhD in Australia and then somehow you wind up in Lenny's lab at MIT how did that happen I've been interested in aging since I was four since I realized that everybody and everything around me is gonna die that's a pretty big shock for everybody most people forget about it because you just can't function thinking about it every day I forgot about it until my teenage years and I realized that with the technology that was coming online these are the days of early PCR and gene sequencing we used to call it genetic engineering

[00:08:09] I thought maybe we're just the last generation who's gonna live a normal lifespan a regular evolved lifespan and our children and our children's children forever are going to be able to benefit from these new technologies and dammit this is not right I've got grandparents parents friends and about five billion people who could really be benefited right now so at that point I decided to seek out the best people in the world and see if I could go work with them and

[00:08:38] I got a PhD in molecular biology in yeast genetics and that was a great PhD and a real turning point for me was this guy from MIT who I knew about because he was also a yeast researcher he was a legend I'd read all these papers Lenny groans he came to Australia and Here I am this young 20-something year old having dinner with Lenny gurantee and my PhD supervisor from

[00:09:00] Australia and Lenny starts telling this story halfway through dinner about this new project that a guy called Nicanor austriac oh and Brian Kennedy had just started doing and it was to try and find genes that controlled Aging in yeast cells and I said okay I know yeast and I've always wanted to figure this out damn it that's what I want to do save me a spot Lonnie I'm coming to your lab and he went yeah yeah yeah whatever as he does to prote most people who want to join his lab so I wrote to him pretty soon after maybe six months cause finishing up can I come to your lab and he wrote back like he does to everybody sure you can come but then milliseconds later I was disappointed because he said you have to bring your own funding so that was no small task and that's destroying itself just briefly though this is a lesson for anyone who's listening who thinks that getting to somewhere like this is is easy it's you have to be massively determined you have to have grit and I just wouldn't give up because there's nothing else I wanted to do in my life I certainly was looking at patent law even but that would I think I would have died if I'd done that as a career I just don't have the attention span anyway I actually found funding it turns out I applied to the Helen hey

[00:10:12] Whitney Foundation which is a prestigious foundation here and they wrote to me and said you can't apply you're a foreigner and I said well this is the old days with early email I think it might even be post and they wrote back they said well your fara no we can't afford to fly you out to Boston in Cambridge in for an interview and I said well I'll sell my car and I'll pay for the ticket as I understand it I was the first foreigner who was allowed to interview and I flew here I stayed in

[00:10:39] Nicanor Austria Arcos basement he was very kind and my interview was with a guy who everyone was telling me is a real tough guy super smart I'd never heard of him of course now everybody in science knows of Doug Milton he's king of well endocrinology and stem cells at Harvard and I was just this kid showing up for an interview and there was a line of people outside his door waiting and I was fifth in line and I went in and professor Milton said to me

[00:11:07] David tell me what you want to do and I had literally five minutes to impress this guy on a smartest people you'll ever meet so you've sold your car flown 22 hours for a five-minute interview yeah that was basically it and so I thought about it most of my adult life what was aging about and a lot of people in those days back in the late 80s early 90s we're talking about the evolution of aging jeans death jeans and I studied two evolutionary biology myself and that didn't make any sense you don't evolve death means mites

[00:11:39] I never subscribed to the group theory of selection so every every person for themselves Selfish Gene loved all canned stuff and so my thought was the only genes that I could understand could evolve that have relevance to aging or longevity genes and right about that time there was the discovery of in C elegans the nematode worm of the daf-2 mutation from yeah I was about to say this must have correspondent with

[00:12:02] Cynthia's work right around the same time it's just happening and Lenny at the same time had just discovered a mutation that they wouldn't show what it was doing but turns out it led to the sirtuins story and so I said to Doug I want to come to Lenny's lab and discover life genes genes that give life and longevity and I guess he liked the idea what I was saying was certainly very passionate it probably didn't hurt that

[00:12:28] I brought a bottle of red wine as a present I just thought that's what you do when you come to people's place later on I learned that that's equivalent to bribing somebody good I was just a young kid but yeah that that's what happened I got the foreshadowing the resveratrol there yeah definitely it was auspicious kind of a thing but being able to come to Lenny's lab I would have worked in

[00:12:49] Lenny's left free I would have lived in the basement and done it that's just how much I wanted to do this so I came over it was a late 1994 early 95 when things were just starting to take off trying to understand what these mutations were that Brian had found it was Matt Cable in there as well Matt's also a close friend he was not there yet so the lab has produced just a ridiculous amount of sort of prolific individuals in this anti-aging space it was a golden age though you could definitely feel that something special was going on in those days but I arrived I was the first post talked to Joe to study aging specifically was Brian a

[00:13:23] PhD student yeah so Brian I was this new guy on the block Brian teach me how to do yeast aging and he taught me but all the other postdocs they're probably 18 to 20 postdocs they're big lab all working on transcription regulation and that was the sexy thing and I was told by I don't think I've told anybody publicly this that that the postdocs were saying you crazy to work on this aging project

[00:13:46] Lenny's lost his mind it's a house of cards it's gonna fall down you can't study aging in yeast all of these things and within the first few weeks I thought it may be I've made a mistake maybe I was just fooled maybe Lenny isn't that smart as I thought but I stuck with it but I do remember at one point on the phone nearly crying to my mother saying

[00:14:04] I think I made a really big mistake and that stands out as a point where I could have easily just quit but I stuck with it and thank goodness I did because Lenny was right and Lenny is really the smart visionary that saw that this was the right way to go so you sort of alluded to it earlier Lenny was sort of on to something right was there basically a new pathway now if we go back in time to 94 what did we know well we barely knew about tour I mean it was just being basically figured out that this thing that Michael Hall had figured out a year earlier Saul is figuring out

[00:14:42] David is figuring out I mean there's this there's still this early triangulation of what's going on with with rapamycin at the time they didn't even if I recall I don't think we knew that there was mTOR quantum torque too and they were doing totally different things ampk is pretty well understood met

[00:14:58] Foreman's been around but I don't think people really had a sense at the time that it was anything other than an anti-diabetic drug so talk me through this whole store - in thing that's a pretty broad question yeah let me narrow it down a little bit talk me through what you were just about to allude to that what was Lenny on to when you showed up well genetics is a fabulous tool because you don't have to go in with any hypothesis that biology will tell you the answer and the gene that had just been cloned by Brian turned out to be what's called Sur for now so for didn't turn out to be a mammalian conserved gene so four has not been as exciting but there was this partner of the surf for Jean

[00:15:39] I was called sir to answer to and so three and so four formed this complex of proteins stick together in control of all things gene silencing that's what sir stands for silent information regulator in this case number two and that was very unexpected in those days if you think back the cause of aging was thought to be DNA damage mutations free radicals so we were all expecting to find genes that controlled DNA repair or antioxidants at that time because I go back and I think at that time I was still in college studying math and engineering I didn't know I didn't take in a biology course so I can't think about it through the context of my own education how well was it understood that there were introns and exons and that much of the genome wasn't even coding instant like was that also was that well understood at that point in time it was in yeast actually they were ahead of it anybody else in eukaryotes we knew that there were introns are not many introns in yeast anyway but we hadn't seen the full genome it was still bits and pieces maybe five ten percent was known my PhD was sequencing three genes that's all it took we thanks for changing rapidly this new thing with PCR you could move tubes into hot tubs and amplified genes it was all very exciting but what we didn't have any clue was that why a silencing gene that controlled negatively controlled genes other genes why that hood would have anything to do with aging it was totally bizarre it led to string of cell papers and one after another every few months we were actually publishing something new and we had a science paper and that was the the gold rush of this discovery because it really turned on the lights in this cave of a whole new era of biology and we're still trying to understand actually why those silencing proteins are relevant to aging but what we do know for sure is that these same genes these are two ins in all life forms whether they're from plants always to us do play a protective role in responding to energy and nutrients just like the NP kinase named towpath we do so you alluded to cert to was that first found in yeast yes it was it was known already actually Lenny and we didn't discover certo was already known as a silencing protein that controlled the mating type in other words the sex of a soul and if you don't have the silencing what happens is that the yeast cells get confused because they're now turning on genes for a and alpha which means male and female and you cell that doesn't know if it's male or female will not mate and it's become sterile and turns out that's a hallmark of yeast aging is sterility so if you you know you the way you can tell whether yeast cell is truly old is is it sterile or is it just sick and that's how we used to tell but now we actually understand the cause of that sterility it's the actual the the movement of surtout protein away from those genes that it should be at to go deal with other problems in the cell I see so it's not that sir - becomes deactivated it just for lack of a better description shifts its attention elsewhere right it becomes distracted by other things going on in the cell and and we had a cell paper in 1999 with

[00:18:46] Kevin Mills and Lenny where we discovered and a couple of other groups should also get credit for Co discovering this is that the sirtuins are also involved in DNA repair when you get a broken chromosome it's the sort of two complex that goes along helps unwrap the DNA we think and put it back together and repair that and while the sort of too complex is doing that it cannot be also silencing there's not enough of it to go around and you might ask well why would this help do that why don't you just make more so - what we think is that this is a very ancient system that coordinates controlling mating and DNA repair you don't want to be mating and dividing if you've got a broken chromosome so this is a way of coordinating those two events and it's very ancient it's a very active system you need DNA checkpoint signaling so it's not just random but what we also have come to realize is that this let's call it this distraction of the screw to ins it's conserved we find this happens in our own aging process as well so there's really two roles there's gene silencing and DNA repair now sirtuins are HD x is that correct are they all aged X so H DAC histone deacetylases this is the old name for protein deacetylases now because well we've all come to real as histones are just one of the things that sirtuins in these other HDX - they can target what are called non-histone proteins and they remove not just a settle groups but also other types of what are called generally acyl groups and so that's a whole new world that means that sirtuins the family there are seven of them in mammals five of them in yeast target other proteins proteins that are in cytoplasm in the nucleus even in the mitochondria and that's their role it's not so much only about controlling the chromatin and histone but also about controlling signaling and metabolism as well and they can do that by targeting any protein theoretically in a Cell so what are the you know again thinking back to DAF to daf-16 as the parallels with Fox oh and IGF were they're elegant experiments in the yeast that could show you extreme conditions of lots of cert no cert and what that phenotype is oh yeah these were the first experiments so I'll try to take you through them correctly in sequence so the what we showed with Brian first of all in sir 1996 cell paper was that we were looking for this movement there was this so-called age locus we didn't know what it was we didn't know where they were going we just know that they knew that they left the sound mating time locus so what we did was we stained it so Brian had moved on actually to his postdoc and Kevin Mills and I student at the time our job was to find where the proteins going so he stained them and we could look at the microscope and what we saw was they were going to this little place in the nucleus which we eventually figured out was the nucleolus which is what makes the our RNA which makes the ribosomes it's a really important part and the DNA that's within the nucleus is called the ribosomal DNA or the our DNA and that's where they were going not just during normal aging but also during an accelerated form of aging so there's a whole story that was lost in history actually that maybe I'll just quickly touch on one of the first things I did when I got to Lenny's lab was to work on

[00:22:04] Werner syndrome which is premature aging disease and these are kids that died in their teens or 20s aren't they know that that's the different hutchinson-gilford syndrome this one one as they live - it's over 40's yeah but the gene was just cloned by George Martin and his team out there and the coma login yeast is called sgs1 and I picked up the paper it was in science I recall when into Lenny's office and I said I've just been scooped but there's a yeast homologue I'm gonna work on that is that okay and he said yeah go for it and so we worked on sts-1 for a little bit and what we found was that they were going through accelerated aging as well so we had a science paper on that and what was exciting about that was that they were also becoming sterile and this were too complex was moving as well just like the normal aging so we had this model rapid aging model and you might say well so what what's the big deal you've got a rapid aging model but a that told us that there was some universal process that results in premature aging in humans probably in yeast the same thing and we could also study this much more easily than an old

[00:23:07] Yi cell consider that to find a single old yeast cell it's really hard especially if you're just studying replicative aging which is the number of times they divide each mother cell produces on average 10 to the power of 25 offspring Wow okay so that by my calculations about 30 million offspring and you have to pull out that one cell and study it by chemically wait you said 10 to the 25 yeah that's sorry 2 to the 25 oh ok yeah but in any case that's that's way more so what we used to do is to sort out the old cells we'd label them with a chemical and pull them out with magnetic beads but it was a real we couldn't get many of them you just get a handful but with these SGS one is protein you could get bunch of them the mutants we could get a lot more and so we'd made a lot of progress using that but every time we made a discovery the SGS protein our mutants we went back to the normal yeast cells and verified but we were actually able to figure out what that mutant what the distracting problem was for the so complex and that was actually DNA breaks and DNA recombination that was occurring at the most repetitive regions the most unstable region of the genome which is the our DNA which is in the nucleolus and that was what was distracting those proteins interesting when you knock out sir - is it easy to knock it out yes that was the next experiment okay so then we you know the prediction is if you knockouts or two you should get a lot more of this instability they already named yes and the question is does it translate to accelerated aging or not necessarily sighted aging but more cancer or some other phenotype right well in yeast it lead to accelerated aging through the process I was telling you about genomic instability DNA repair went went down and also that happens in animals although it's a little more complex because it's embryonic lethal in a lot of in a lot of mice so you can't easily do that experiment but you can do is the opposite you can turn on or over express the surtout gene in a yeast cell and if we're right you should get a few things that are gonna happen you'll have more genomic stability at this particularly this our DNA locus in the nucleolus and the yeast cells should live longer and that experiment was done by an incoming graduate student Matt cabling and one what a fantastic project to get when you walk in he did it and the day that he got life plan extension with extra co2 was a very good one for him and the lab so what's the next step from there the most obvious thing is how do you develop a compound that would do this without the genetic mutation that empowered it yeah that was the issue because you can't easily genetically manipulate humans so the question was how do you turn on these genes now we we spent about three four years working on caloric restriction in yeast and then in mammals and my lab and some others were leading the charge in showing that sirtuins both in yeast and mammals were not only necessary but were sufficient when you ever expressed them to mimic calorie restriction put another way if you knock outs or two you don't get the benefits of character benefits of CR right and that's also now being shown by others to be true in mice as well so that that led to the idea that is that they're free in all mice I couldn't say you know there's even in yeast you can get around the need for sirtuins if you stress the yeast really intensely with very little amount of calories but there are you know there are aspects of of calorie restriction benefits such as a lifespan extension that are ameliorated lessened by us or to knockout but it's still complexified by the fact that it's lethal in embryos and you have to knock it out in the adult to do a really yeah it's the same sort of issue

[00:26:42] Cinthia head with the daffs which was if you do too early you the c.elegans doesn't make it into an intermediate stage you know what somebody hasn't even done the proper experiment which is to take a mouse that you can knock out short one in an adult whole body and then calorie restrict something that we probably should have done years ago we didn't but the technology is there to do that but what what we did learn actually was both in Eastern and mammals was that it's not just one of these genes that's important it's the whole family and that if you knock out take these for example if you knock outs or two in yeast you lose the ability to respond to some mild calorie switch but if you really calories tricked them they'll still live longer and there was a big debate actually between Brian Matt myself about that and where we settled on was that these other two related genes we're also helping and they work as a family and if you knock one out the others can come you only have one east of five you survive and humans have a whole family let's say eight or something just seven okay so only two more that's interesting little no in fact most people ignore the other yeast sirtuins but they're just as interesting and what we found is they also can extend lifespan as well so when you actually it's funny I was gonna go back to something else you said a second ago but what's the teleological ination for why caloric restriction and sirtuins would move hand-in-hand I'm just like for many you talked earlier about your appreciation for sort of evolutionary biology so an organism is you know in a nutrient deprived environment it still has to be able to do a bunch of things if it's going to be fit do we believe that that's an environment where we need to see more stabilization of the genome or repair or silencing or what do we think is the biggest insult during that period of time yeah that so the biggest insult to any life-form is a broken chromosome that's lethal if you don't fix it and do we see that more likely happening during nutrient deprivation I see that as I would have assumed to be honestly I would have assumed that was independent of nutrient exposure or at least if anything inversely correlated on have enough nucleotides to complete replication you're gonna break a lysis so they do go hand-in-hand but the bigger picture is that the sirtuins evolved and we believe what are we talking about three and a half billion years ago in the first life-forms early life forms maybe just after the first one of the first proteins to actually evolve we think would be acetone and its job is to sense stress biological stress in the environment whether it's DNA damage or it's you know a burst of cosmic rays change in temperature or a lack of nutrients and their job is to allow that organism to hunker down and survive stop mating stop breeding we can do that in another day if we don't survive this our offspring ain't gonna die anyway so they can't we think we control which genes to turn on and off in response to adversity and they allow those organisms to survive but they're also talking to other pathways so they're gonna talk to em - are they going to talk to Cynthia's deaf pathway and collectively these are the genes that we've settled on is the longevity pathways but they didn't evolve for longevity evolved for survival of during adversity how conserved are these across let's you know use the big four models of eukaryotes from yeast worms flies you know larger mammals like mice and rodents is this relatively well conserved the way the Tor pathway is conserved or does it have more bends in the road well they're surprisingly conserved that you can just manipulate one gene in each of these organisms and get lifespan extension or one drug works in all of these organisms I would challenge anyone to use the chemotherapy to help a yeast cell so this is a quite a magical discovery that the same pathways are that well conserved and that ancient and that's actually one of the advantages we have aging is actually not that difficult to be able to control and that's because our models are very good if we can I really believe that if we can extend the lifespan of a yeast or worm in a mouse humans are so close right that if you can do it across a billion years you should be able to make that leap to a few other hundred million exactly it's really just the regulatory agencies in making sure that we don't do any harm and it's safe but the biology is all still there going way back three and a half billion years ago so it was 2006 2007 when did respira trial emerge as an early sirtuin activator 2003 okay and yeah the story behind that was that we were looking for an activator we're hoping for an activator we're using your own lab at this point yes your postdoc I'm guessing yeah I managed to move to Harvard in 1999 so that was the year when a lot of things happened while I while I was moving we published this DNA just going back to the silly sort of social question did you at some point think I want to go back to Australia and set up a lab here like what was it a difficult decision for you to stay in Boston as opposed to because you came from Sydney if I recall right well the goal was to because like those are pretty different climates I've been to Sydney once I spent two weeks there I could stay there yeah I missed that but I also like adversity I thrive on adversity and so I've come to like living here the intention was to come here for two years I had a job to go back to and but the first week of being here in Boston was like a city I could only dream about this is the Athens of ancient Greece Rome of ancient Rome for biology this is it and so I I was in heaven I'd never experienced a city where you're on the train and people around you're reading science magazine and nature that that's that's my dream so it was a very easy decision not to go back to Australia for reasons that if you really want to change the world you got to do it from here so now you're in you're in the process of kick-starting your own lab which comes with its own stresses right you've kind of secured funding and all those other things and then what's happening in the on the front of this stuff yeah so 1999 a few major things happen one was this DNA repair connection the second one was

[00:32:52] Lanie's lab published that nad was a requirement for to an activity and Shina my who's a wash you know was the postdoc who made that somewhat serendipitous but brilliant discovery and then the third thing was the connection to calorie restriction was happening around that time to going back to the second thing we talk about it now today like it's in textbooks it's so obvious right that sirtuins are nad dependent deacetylase okay nad is so ubiquitous in cells that if the quantity you could have in a cell varies on a scale from one to ten what is sufficient to produce this deacetylase activity is it anywhere from two to ten or does it have to be you know quite a high concentration it can be two to ten you can actually get very low levels in some disease conditions and the animal is still alive so it's basically only saying that nad is necessary for sirtuins to work right well without nad we'd be getting thirty seconds but by other reasons as well I mean wouldn't we be dead just from not being able to do electron transports we would and there's more than 500 reactions that you need just to survive but what we didn't know in the 2000s and it was actually quite a crazy thing to think that nad was regulating anything and that was actually what we first worked on in my lab was the control of so trillions with nad levels the reason it's crazy is you read textbooks and nad is that the most ubiquitous important molecule in a cell how could it possibly be varied during aging let alone during the day when you eat something or your circadian rhythm now it's obvious we know nad goes up and down it changes with age but in those days people thought if you changed any D levels you'd probably die that's not true was it known at the time that doesn't complex one of the mitochondria basically convert NADH to nad mhm so the you would at least know that in the mitochondria the concentration of nad must go up and down or else you couldn't actually respire well locally it goes up and down but the state level is pretty constant and and when you say going up and down are you talking cytoplasmic nuclear plasma where are we talking about you know we had a paper I think was 2007 where we had a quite a surprising result which told us that it's not just the cytoplasm there it goes up and down it was the also the mitochondria going up and down and we didn't know that we actually we stumbled upon it we found that if we kept cells with high amounts of nad they would survive better DNA damage others insults and we could deplete nad in the cytoplasm but they still the cells still lived and we didn't understand that how did you do that by the way how do you deplete an ad actually come to think of it we could either overexpress nad depleting enzymes but actually the way we found it was that when you damage cells with that DNA damaging agents a chemotherapy drug the cells themselves to pleat nad naturally with this enzyme called PARP 1 which is an nad consuming enzyme and that actually that's very well known that if you hit a cell with a

[00:35:57] DNA damage agent the reason that it dies is an ad depletion so we were measuring the nad depletion in the context and that's because the cell is trying to utilize that nad to repair the damage you've just caused right right so you didn't know that at the time no that was well known so part one is a known DNA repair protein and that's if you block pop you also protect cells but what was interesting was that we could overexpress give more copies of a gene that made nad and this is called an MPT which is the equivalent of the PNC one gene in yeast which we found was important for lifespan in those organisms so we were over expressing least amputee cells had more ne D hit them with the toxin they'd survive better than regular cells but the nad was still being almost completely depleted from the side sorry just because this is this is sort of at the crux of it did they survive because they were unable to deplete their nad no we saw that nad just disappeared from the cell but they survived but they still survived but there was a place we weren't looking at the time and we tracked it down to the mitochondria so this begs the term the mitochondrial oasis hypothesis so myself and anthony Solvay from cornell coined this term because what we found was that as long as the mitochondria stayed active with their innate he it didn't matter the cell could survive and recover from that stress and actually turns out that the levels of mitochondria nad levels are even more important than cytoplasmic nad levels for survival that makes sense and of course that's a hard thing to measure isn't it it was extremely hard that's where Anthony came in Anthony is a chemist and a biochemist at heart and it was extremely hard to isolate these mitochondria preserve the nad in them we had to use new technologies to be able to do that well how is that done we were using my spectrum three for the first time to measure any

[00:37:43] Dean what Anthony did brilliantly was to make labelled versions of any D in its precursors and he could spike those in and use those as references to measure energy levels in these compartments an nad if I recall from just biochemistry you don't get to move that in and out of plasma into cells it's made de novo in the cell you have what you have you can make more you can bring in precursors but you don't get to shuttle nad between cells correct as far as we know right okay yeah it's sort of like an ATP problem like it's really hard to quantify ATP in a cell by the way does nad p do any of this as well well it it's important no doubt it's part of this whole problem that we were working on but if you add n ADP or even NADH which is only different by 100 yes they don't those don't work too activates which ones only in a d-plus will do that and I mean nothing at too nerdy on this or but is it it's obviously more than just the charge but the charge must play a role if n ID H can't work right yeah so it's probably a combination of the charge and some other in size and size yeah okay so now you've made this these three discoveries the second of which we just went into in a little bit more detail how does the story unfold now you've got your spanking new lab well you worked for a little while on the sts-118 ona's protein yes and telomeres put out a paper on that and we didn't work on sirtuins for about a year because Lenny said I don't want you working on certain ones when I left the lab which was a bit of a shock why he doesn't want didn't want the competition

[00:39:17] I suppose but I thought he was enough to give him a head start but we quickly started working back home is that a common request if people wouldn't postdocs leave their labs no of course not but what am I gonna do I mean the guy the guy trained me yo-yo in my career but in those days it was very competitive and so I you know the lenny of today is not the lenny of previous years and he's a wonderful friend and mentor to me but that's how it was in those days it was very cutthroat I see but if it were to up to you you would have continued to work on sirtuins right so then now we're basically back to 2001 2002 you're the moratorium is up you're now back to working on it and nobody at this point in time has yet figured out a way to exogenously manipulates her to ins more than these stuff that we've already talked about which is nutrients stress and things like that yeah we were trying to feed yeast nad and we gave them nicotinamide which is a precursor to nad vitamin b3 and actually Kevin Bitterman who's now a very successful venture capitalist well my first student he put nicotinamide on yeast and we could measure the so2 activity by the color and if so - it was more active they turn red and he walked into my office one of his first experiments when we worked on sirtuins and he said David something's weird we didn't get activation we got inhibition so the yeast had gone red and

[00:40:32] I said Kevin doesn't matter what happens if it's unexpected that's even better so that led to a paper that said that vitamin b3 high doses is inhibitory officer - and so now the labs around the world use nicotinamide as an inhibitor friscoe - and then I wouldn't recommend taking really high doses of nicotinamide why is that there's a few answers biochemical answer is that there's a involved pocket in this or - and structure that measures nicotine my levels and it's a feedback loop so nicotinamide is to get nerdy is the product of the reaction it takes an ad cleaves it oh I got it so it's just a negative feedback I've seen too much b3 and it's saying I have too much of my output slow down turn it down exactly so we struggled with that we couldn't get any d2 going to cells it's too big even with mammalian cells is difficult as we were looking at ways to make more nad in the cell that was our original thesis before his virtual was on the radar and we were turning on and discovering the genes that made nad in yeast and we cloned some of the genes in that pathway and there was one particular one that was called peon is called PNC one and it had been studied in the context of tuberculosis and what we found was that when we calorically restricted yeast cells this was one of the most highly up regulated genes in the whole yeast style which was very unusual people had discovered this before in their own lab but they were wondering what the heck is this nad synthesis pathway got to do with calorie restriction got to do with stress but we knew exactly what was happening this is a stress response that was turning on nad production and activating sore tunes so we had a our first nature paper actually on that mm - I think 2003 and we found the pnc one could mimic caloric restriction and raise nad or availability and if we knocked out the

[00:42:22] PNC one gene Yi cells didn't live longer when we calorie restricted them and what's really interesting about that I think is that PNC one doesn't just get turned on by Clarke restriction it's turned on by heat low amino acids salt high salt and so this is a gene that senses the environment and turns on the sirtuins exactly what I was explaining earlier about those early life forms on the planet since their environment and through nad in other ways they can turn on these pathways for defense so where did you go from PNC one to resveratrol well we we teamed up with a company at the time they were called bio mall and they were making reagents for H deck assays this kind of thing and Conrad howit's was a scientist there and he had invented wasn't even available yet an assay force or to an activity in vitro I figure out why he reached out to me but he said hey well maybe I wrote to him but whatever happened he sent me some kits to test and they worked and it looked great what was the gold standard prior to these kids oh gosh a major to an activity would required Western blotting which is detecting these Kjellberg it was horribly hard still is and this was a very quick way to look for molecules and what Conrad did was to take that assay and look through his collection of molecules at biome all they had libraries of these things and two of the first molecules that worked that were discovered by him to change the activity of sort one humans for one were a couple of plant molecules now he found plenty of inhibitors that was that was it wasn't the hard part exactly but he called me up and he said David this is a something's weird we've got these molecules that seem to activate the enzyme and I said that that's great that's what we need and he goes well I don't know if it's real but you know let's work on this so we worked on it together for about six months trying to prove this wrong because in the history of pharmaceuticals has only been a handful of molecules ever that have been true allosteric activators as these apparently were but we thought it could be could be fake it could be messing with ya say could be an antioxidant activity but what really clinched it for me at first was we put these molecules onto cells and they lived longer but only when the scoochie gene was present and the chance of that happening and us being wrong about this idea were pretty low so that was a good sign but the other thing that's not well known in history is that those first two molecules that Conrad how it's discovered they were not resveratrol they were actually I think PI C channel and quercetin questions found in fruits and onions I think but there was a brilliant CEO Rob Zipkin and Rob was a chemist and Conrad showed him these structures that were quite similar these two molecules they look like two rings connected by a bridge and Rob said hey you know what these two molecules look like resveratrol and so Conrad and I are like oh what's very very tall anyway I certainly was I didn't know much about resveratrol but I googled it and it comes up with i'll suspect an ingredient for red wine and i could just say the next 10 years of media which actually happened but it was an interesting time because we were it was the first molecule that that I can recall was clearly lifespan extending in an organism that you had a defined genetic pathway that wasn't just found off the shelf we really knew the pathway and we figured out and as still as far as I know the only drug program that that has come out of the aging field where it was by design that we find these molecules so you know full credit to Dave and to others who have their molecules that that have come out of so when they first started to make risk fear at all for the purpose of these experiments they weren't extracting it out of naturally occurring sources it was just being synthesized straightaway even though it was acknowledged that hey this thing also exists in nature well no

[00:46:20] I think that probably was an extract but I'm not being very articulate but the point I want to make is we did it in a different order so repre myosin and metformin we're already on the Shelf doing other things discovered by others for doing things and then you can trace them back to the public when you get lifespan extension we didn't do it that way we said this was the direct target we went genetics first and then found a molecule and then tested on the organism which is you can do it both ways but this was more rational science but anyway that that's the reason but we also had this very interesting result that we found a yeast mutant that and actually a short one mammalian mutant that was blocked that couldn't respond to his vertical was so he already knew that there was an amino acid that was required for this activation by resveratrol in the test tube which told me this isn't just some random thing this is a highly conserved mechanism because we could also show this amino acid was found in other organisms as well in which amino acid was that in short one it's called e 2 30 and the mutation made a lysine so it went from a negative charge to a positive charge at that location we didn't know why it blocked it now we do but that was one of the early things that we had in our knowledge base to be able to go forward now when when you put resveratrol in cell culture like you had with the previous two compounds you mentioned with the previous compounds if they lacked surtout and they did not get the longevity phenotype did you see the same thing with harissa at all we did in yeast and then in worms and then in flies and so the fly work a couple of Brown University scientists

[00:47:58] Mark Taylor and Steven health and did the fly work we did the worm work predominantly and that went into an another science paper I think 2005 2004 and what was exciting about those days was that here we had things as distant as a yeast cell and a fly separated probably by 500 million years or more mm-hmm and we had a sir to dependent drug lifespan extension molecule lifespans in turn which to me said that we're on to something interesting here yep remind me what was the phenotype of the non cert bearing organism oh now you stretching my memory in flies it I don't recall there being a strong phenotype if you're asking where they really short-lived yeah that's what I'm basically trying to get at is when you demonstrate the first proof of concept which is this drug won't work on you if you don't have served in other words I think where

[00:48:51] I'm really going with this is are there other plausible explanations for how these compounds could have extended life outside of sirtuin oh yeah yeah sure there's plenty of possibilities I mean it could have just been that the surgeons were making them so sick that they weren't but one of the reasons that we thought that that it was real was that we tried to write every other possibility we fed flies antioxidants even if you got life's angst it wasn't through this fortuyn's you know you can only make hypotheses and test them as best you can with the tools you have in those days that's what we did but now we can actually go back and replace the so2 and mutant with this point mutation that only knocks out changes one amino acid which is real that's real microsurgery and when we do that and we go back now we can still see a requirement for two for these effects so it was the mouse paper in oh five OH six that was the one that kind of brought this to everybody's attention I was even outside of the aging community correct right well so the the res virtual story in yeast was one thing but when the mouse paper came out in nature in 2006 it went global and it was caught the attention of probably most people on the planet certainly those who drank wine paid attention the wine industry sales I'm told went up 30% and have stayed up and uh that yeah that was 2006 very interesting time and what's not well-known in history is that we didn't know if this was gonna work or was it real Hail Mary pass going back to that experiment those were not wild-type mice those were overfed mice correct they were metabolically ill we had both experiments running in parallel okay but we got the results earlier for the fat mice and that was what so the you had the control mice and you had the treatment mice the control mice but both mice were fed the same which was a sort of high-fat high-sugar metabolically disruptive diet presumably the usual yeah the so-called Western diet yeah yeah and in that so what was the outcome of that experiment how much longer did the resveratrol treated animals live approximately I think it was 20 percent something like that 25 percent and I was initiated at what age a year so there's a pretty mature mice there middle aged mice almost right there what 30 40 years old Evelyn exactly what dose do you remember I'm gonna guess I think it was a 200 milligrams per kilogram per day per day but we also had a group on feeding every other day as well and those those who know how to be pretty interesting as well that's a pretty high dose relative to what did the ITP s that came out that following use doses that high so we've done it now in two different doses we've done two hundred and ten times less okay and it actually it works in both and what we find actually is that the higher dose is acting on other pathways including the

[00:51:43] NP kinase metformin Elena pathway activating it so it's synergistic with metformin we don't know that but part of the debate about resveratrol is that if you give cells in culture or mice too much resurect well then it kicks in other pathways and in this case it was activating a MP kinase as well we published that in our first paper in 2016 supplemental that most people haven't read but we knew it was activating IB Connie's at that high dose and that what that means is that when you're activating multiple pathways it's very hard to dissect that so we these days both in cell culture and in mice were very careful to use the minimum dose to get an effect not overdose because it just makes things much more complicated so that you mentioned that you had a parallel experiment that was done in presumably mice that were not overfed what did that experiment show so the fat mice they were healthier that goes without saying I think most people know that in a thin mice they also were healthier they had better cardiovascular system less cancer a whole variety of things that were exciting it didn't reach statistical significance when they ate resveratrol every day but if we gave it to them in their diet every other day we saw a lifespan extension that tells me a couple of things one is that it could be that being fed every other day kicks in some other pathways that are helpful we don't know that for sure we'll be kicking in pathways that aren't helpful wouldn't it didn't if I understood you correctly didn't you say that the mice the non so the lean were going back to lean experiment if you had the treatment animals respect all everyday they did not have a statistically significant survival advantage if you fed them respond to said yeah every so if you only give them food with ritual every second day we had mice that were living far longer than just that just a diet alone were they being fed non-respiratory food on the alternate days no they also they were calorically restricted right ant okay so there's now two very so that could have been the caloric restriction that was extending their life no because there is virtual added on to that as well so there was another control of just being fed every other day right right and that came out in a Cell Metabolism paper in 2008 so from that experiment one might conclude that risk fair at all enhanced caloric restriction the response to CR it did yeah so that you if you if you've had a control group a CR group fed every other day and then a CR + resveratrol group you would see a dose response and we did that and one of the things that that might have been happening is that now residuals not a very potent molecule we've got things that are a thousand times more potent now but the other problem with resveratrol is that it's not very soluble and the blood levels both in mice and in humans doesn't get up very high unless you eat some fat so that Western diet we had much better absorption than this low-dose lean diet and so it may have just been getting the drug on board quote-unquote the drug or it may just be that resveratrol isn't potent enough or that that were wrong about this but the reason I don't think we're wrong about the sirtuins is when you overexpress the gene in the brain for example it will extend lifespan and other sirtuins do that as well just going back to that that's a very interesting idea about the fat solubility was the experiment ever done where you took mice and you fed them with and without the resveratrol because they're presumably it's not the solubility of the fat that they're eating it's the bile acids that enable the emulsification of the molecule and the you know whatever the jejunal absorption so that would be a quick way to show even without a hard outcome if you were just getting more into the cells right if the resveratrol had greater absorption with and without fatty food that's resulted in bile acids secretion yeah well we didn't measure bile acids but we could definitely see by measuring blood levels resveratrol was getting on board when we gave some fat in the food and that's true in humans that's why if I take resveratrol I do it with a something that's fatty flatly so some oil a yogurt it works really well got it okay well that's so that's elegant okay so then three studies come out thereafter two of them were I tee pees through ni a one was not you were on two of those papers I believe and one of them actually two of them were sort of looking at multiple molecules in testing correct and I think one of them I thought it was odd because it looked at rapamycin which made sense and then simvastatin and then respira trial I never understood the simvastatin part even like I wouldn't expect that a short-term treatment with simvastatin would have much of an outcome what did those studies find the ITP s they just showed what we already published which is that if you give her a troll in regular food it doesn't extend lifespan and why did they why couldn't that have been overcome I mean that seems like they should have given that you'd already put cuz you published yours no.6 these were like oh eight and 11 or 1112 something like these were several years later well that the yeah though scientists didn't consult me at all they just put in the food plan for it I see so in parallel to this now something really interesting happens which is all of a sudden a pharma company takes notice of something which is risperdal was there an IND that gets filed on that or was this a pure grass application and meaning in FDA sort of generally regarded this safe path way how was risperdal taken into a clinical trial with humans that is well what was going on in the commercial side was screening of more molecules so there was a whole bunch of synthetic molecules that we can talk about whereas Verrill itself was considered a proof-of-concept molecule largely if it ended up in the clinic or would have it I mean as a drug it would've been great but when your intuition was it might be it might not well we knew it was a terrible molecule because of the solubility alone yeah right but we was at millimolar like what kind of concentrations were needed once it was in the plasma to reach it is it a is it a micro molar milli micro molar which is it really that's not a drug you know yeah I want to go ahead with but it allowed us to to get into humans and see what would happen do we see the same kinds of things or could we deliver it on the skin or on the eye so that was a goal and there was some very good formulation chemists who were trying to and succeed in work working on ways to make resveratrol absorbable in the body and there were some clinical trials that were initiated under an IND and there was one that was looking at blood sugar levels and that one I think he's published now and what kind of doses were they using in the phase one do you remember it was massive levels because the scientists that were running the studies they were worried that there wasn't enough about bioavailability so they were giving I think 10 grams a day which is was there any toxicity at 10 grams unclear unclear that there was some in in regular people there was nothing there was a couple of patients in a cancer study that had renal failure which happens anyway in these late stage patients so that but that was enough to say this is not worth it because this is a blockbuster drug anyway it's a probe at best at least according to the company that was running the trials so they you know exercised an abundance of caution and stopped that trial in the cancer patients but that's odd why was it being done in cancer patients well part of it was that trying to remember but the person who was running the trials had a lot of experience in it but a recall that there was some animal data or at least some in vitro data that resveratrol could help there I see so I didn't I didn't actually realize that at all I didn't so you're saying it was in a Phase one that they had this questionable outcome and thought well maybe it's not worth pursuing this and we'll move on to the second and third generation variants of these well right so the company was was bought by a large pharmaceutical company and a large pharmaceutical company looks at resveratrol and they say this is not a drug this is not something that we want to continue with and so that was certainly part of the decision I'm imagining but what was they really were excited about whether the new chemical entities there were hundreds of them made that were very potent drug like molecules that they wanted to take further and they did take those into humans as well and I should mention that those molecules have been in mice and referred at Cobo deserves a lot of credit credit for doing that and so he's taken the same molecule that went into humans put them into mice these same one-year old mice and found that those do live longer even on a regular diet so that's why I think maybe it's just for his very tall wasn't as potent as we needed it and these other molecule succeeded now you mention and I want to come back to this at the end because it's it's interesting you're one of the few people in this space who speaks openly about you know look in the presence of incomplete information I still take compound X Y you alluded to a moaner you still take risperidone Mike

[01:00:31] Lee that there's any harm and you said you take how much about a gram well that so my calculation is this first of all I'm I like experimenting that's you know I'm not afraid of death that's for sure but I want to be the first person to know if there's problems so I'm also keenly aware that what's gonna happen to all of us if we don't do anything is not pretty either hmm and so what have I got to lose it's cheap

[01:00:52] I've got buckets of it mine in my basement there's been never any sign of toxicity it's been in humans for a long time now take your risk it would seem as what if you're not taking enough sure but you know what one gram I think if it's not if it's not working at a gram then it's not working I don't think it's worth going higher but you know that what's important is that we've made advances since then we're talking about discoveries from a decade ago yeah we've got much better things now so I still take my reserve role because I've seen enough data in humans as well that it can protect the heart you know is it gonna make me live 10 years longer probably not not even five but will a potentially delay cut of vascular disease absolutely so why not you mentioned in a talk that you I think you mentioned this in the talk but you take metformin as well yeah quite recently probably at least half my colleagues that I talked to yeah now you're only taking a pretty low dose if I recall from at least what you said in that talk is that because of the additive effects potentially of resveratrol also activating AMPK yeah you're exactly right if you're starting to take combinations of molecules like I do you want to ramp it up we're going into unknown territory so I mean especially if there's overlap in these pathways right absolutely is overlap anyone who says there isn't is myopic or lying these are pathways they're additive so it could be that taking two grams of metformin plus I'm taking two other molecules would be overdosing it and I don't want to do that so what I do is I start on a reasonable low dose based on all the data that I've read and then I make sure that I'm okay I feel okay my blood tests that are okay and then you know I talk to the experts they're all my friends and I said what do you think about going up to one gram 1/2 gram so actually recently I have gone up to one and a half grams given advice from people who shall remain nameless mm-hmm yes we'll keep everybody nameless so let's fast forward to some of these other molecules because this story is just so interesting and and feel free to go back and patch pieces of history if it makes things but to where we are today but today we are in a place where there's a company there are two companies out there that are selling NR precursor to nad they're packaging it with is it pterostilbene right tell me what that molecule does specifically and why it would make sense to include that with NR yeah so pterostilbene is essentially just where's virtual with some methyl groups on it it's a more novel sexier version of resveratrol but that's this is it any more active in your opinion so

[01:03:26] Lenny has told me that it is but I don't know enough to be able to give a sensible answer okay so you now have a cert activator with an nad precursor that are both basically over-the-counter right that's right so tell me about the excitement in that space I don't want to get too much into the politics of the companies because there at the time of this recording there in World War 3 so let's let's just talk about the science and sort of all the other stuff yeah well if you if you take the 40,000 foot view of this so so

[01:03:58] Lenny is in his 60s now and I mean my 40s like very late 40s and you got to do a calculation how many years do you have left to not only see what happens but potentially even be vindicated and I'm sure that's particle and he's thinking what would Lenny be vindicated for for finding that the sirtuins are important for health longevity oh I see meaning that following this discovery some of the air left the balloon and now there's a resurgence of hey no it really did matter is that what you mean by being vindicated well I think there's a race to see who's pathway is more important got it and this or two ins and mTOR and a/b kinase and some others are in this race you know I think it's a silly argument because they're all important they talk to each other yes but you know ego is involved people want a legacy and

[01:04:50] Lenny's legacy as I understand it can't speak for him directly but is that he wants to have made a major contribution to human health and this is a way of showing that within a timeframe that's reasonable who wants to wait another decade i if I was him I wouldn't want to and so I think that that was a good way of being able to quickly test the hypothesis in an area that you know going through the supplement route I on the other hand I think because I'd had a good experience with pharmaceuticals and

[01:05:21] I also have more time to wait I've took that route and so the two of us are heading in parallel no we're very good friends we talk all the time about this but it's an interesting from an historical perspective that we've got these two guys who are taking very different routes to what we hope has achieved the same thing which is to help people in the end and elysium obviously they've talked very publicly about their goal is to sort of provide a supplement but at a much higher quality obviously in the United States I can't speak to this in the in other countries but the regulatory environment here is quite unique in that basically these supplements are quite unregulated so you're sort of at the mercy of the person who's making the supplement and obviously having a number of Nobel laureates involved with a company like

[01:06:06] Elysium and a commitment a public commitment to use the highest quality stuff at least a person can buy this and say look I'm not getting crushed bird feathers which I'm pretty much guaranteed to be getting with half the stuff I buy online look I bring this up because I think half my patients are either taking elysium basis or the fact a member than any other company chrome a deck so the other yeah have my patients are probably taking and are they always ask me what do you think to which I say I have no earthly clue

[01:06:32] I'm pretty sure it's safe so that it passes the first test which is I don't think it's hurting you one of the issues I've always struggled with is if it worked half as well as it works in the mice it shouldn't be subtle you know you showed in one of your talks and exercise a contrast between two mice running on a treadmill and that was actually one of the milder successes that was like you know a 50% improvement in exercise tolerance I've seen other studies that talk about an 80% improvement in exercise tolerance if people were experiencing a 20% improvement in exercise tolerance I believe we'd know about it do you feel that that's happening and we're missing it or do you feel it's just not going to be possible to elucidate that without a clinical trial even though it's a supplement

[01:07:16] I get a lot of emails every day you might be the single most emailed person on this topic I'm guessing right oh yeah wait till your book comes out probably a thousand of them this week actually I know I'm not exaggerating and to any of you who've written to me I'm sorry I just can't answer them all I will try one of the main questions is well hopefully by having this discussion let's let's go as deep as you want into it so that you can say go listen to that discussion and you know you'll get all your nuanced points across yeah I'll go buy my book that's coming out next year in 2019 do you have a title for it yet by the way it's a tentative title okay at the time of this recording people listening we don't yet know the title but David's book will probably be out in the late summer early fall of 2019 that's right okay yeah so I have some insights into this nad world as its developed it's it's extremely hot that they're selling tons of the material which is great there's that help people now I get a lot of emails from people who claim and they show me data that they used to do races when they were 40 and then they now they're 60 they can't win races they can't cycle but they've gone on this or that in our product or even animate and now they're winning races again so these are stories I hear constantly every few days but I can't judge those because these people I don't know there's no placebo but I think that some of this if it were true that's what we would expect if that these molecules could help people you would hear these anecdotes which are here but I can't declare that I know anything more than you do

[01:08:52] Peter about this because they're all anecdotes so that's why we're doing a human clinical trial now you mentioned an ax man a moment ago can you tell us listening to this the difference between NR nicotinic right beside which is a one-step precursor to nad and n MN well it's very simple so n R is converted by the body into n MN and then nm and is immediately converted to nad so I misspoke I actually thought it was n R that was one step away from nad and n MN went to NR but it's the other way around correct okay both of these can be we know definitively both of these can be brought in to cells to be used as cellular building blocks for nad is there any dispute about the ability to get from high plasma levels into the cell yeah there's a debate it's not earth shattering it's very academic but you're debating in the field about which molecule gets transported and which one doesn't and n are definitely has transported the question is does any n

[01:09:51] MN getting transported and I believe you've written and I think I read in one of your review articles perhaps but it could have been somebody else is that n MN might be slightly more stable than NR well we find that in a lab that if we put them in solution on the bench or leave them on the shelf that in a man is more stable than n R that's why I keep my molecules and Labs molecules in the freezer just to give them some extra shelf life and did you imply by what you said a moment ago that there is no dispute that n R at least gets if you have a high plasma level of NR it is brought into the cell is that diffusion mediated is that transit transporter for an hour there's evidence that there's an

[01:10:30] NR transporter but either way they both raised in a D levels quite effectively in the body in humans as well and so and I'm sorry I know I asked this already but when you say they raise nad levels you mean mitochondrial nad levels or cytoplasmic nad levels oh gee so most of these studies have been done on whole cells from blood or too so they're just like PBMCs or something wait exactly exactly the problem with that is that it's a very dynamic system this isn't a regular drug that just hangs around and you can measure it this is actively utilized by the body so even if it disappears into some pathway it's still probably being recycled it so we have to be very careful not to jump to conclusions if you don't see it in the blood maybe it was taken up by the muscle or the brain so these are the studies that are ongoing now and if you see it in the PBM see it doesn't mean it made it into the hepatocyte right this is all just in an animal you can do that which stands you do those experiments in humans right now using NMR to be able to measure in 80 levels in living tissue and when you say NMR do you mean like

[01:11:30] Mrs or like yes you okay I do so phosphorus MRIs yeah and you can measure ATP and AD right right so those are really powerful and you can actually now do it with seven Tesla magnets with people in the machine while they're exercising so that's where we're headed with this in our next clinical trial hopefully in your intuition David if you could cherry-pick the hierarchy with where you'd want to see the up regulation of nad most which cells would you preferentially be directing it into it well it depends on the if if we want to treat a disease obviously we're going to target that particular tissue so if we're treating a mitochondrial disorder out the muscle obviously the muscle for longevity I would want it to definitely get into old tissues if possible mhm I think it would help if it could get into the hypothalamus where you know there's some central regulation but what the field is just has discovered is that all these tissues not all but but many of these major tissues are secreting proteins that can induce longevity so I wouldn't want to prioritize unless we're talking about a particular disease like liver disease or muscle wasting one of the things David Sabatini and I talked a lot about I'm actually gonna see David for dinner tonight I'm sure this will come up is if you could wave a magic wand and make rapamycin for example tissue-specific let alone complex specific but you get into this and the same thing with metformin it probably does have some tissue specificity probably working more on the liver than it is working in other cells it seems unlikely that a molecule would have uniform and ubiquitous take up of all cells right well of course yeah so with nad we don't know so we're still at the we're basically still in the infancy of knowing where the NR or nmn would be preferentially taken up but it sounds like the mrs studies would would help us understand that so that's going to help and the reason I I qualified that statement was that you know we're still getting approval for these studies but that's the plan but also there are labs in that I'm aware of they were I think will remain nameless as well furred to protect their own confidentiality but they are working on tracer studies to be able to give in our andaman and see where it goes in the body and be able to measure each tissue that we'll know probably within the next year so you mentioned that what Elysium or chroma

[01:13:43] Dex are doing is using they're just basically in a different regulatory paradigm which is they're using molecules that are generally regarded as safe they're outside of these ind pathways you're interested in the same sort of targets but you're gonna go down i don't want to say more rigorous because that but it is more rigorous let's call a spade a spade you're going down a much more expensive that's cool yeah I mean literally two logs more expensive if not three logs more expensive so I want to be sensitive to any confidentiality because that's the nature of the the work that you're doing now but what can you tell us about the molecules you're working on directly and indirectly in that space sure in the nad space there's a couple of companies or one is I can go volt is called metro biotech which is here in Massachusetts and they work on they've been working for five years on making nad precursor molecules that are better than these two that are available publicly and there are ways to improve them better by bioavailability better stability better efficacy and those are moving into the clinic as well and then there's another company called jumpstart fertility which is both here in Massachusetts and down in Australia and we're finding really great effects of these molecules on female infertility or low fertility and that's something we're going to be publishing shortly and is there a type of infertility that this seems most amenable to because going back to your evolutionary argument under periods of stress we see fertility is one of the first things to go for obvious reasons but infertility comes in so many flavors right there could be an inability to release an egg there can be aneuploidy even when the eggs are secreted there can be uterine hostility there's so many things that can result in infertility what does this particular thing target well so what we find in this of the biochemical pathway we've figured out and we poached a little bit on this is that there's a protein called

[01:15:32] Bob r1 which is a kinase that regulates spindle quality and one of the problems with old eggs is that they don't have nice spindles and they rip their chromosomes apart when they fancy aneuploidy exactly so down syndrome etc abortion aborted fetuses but what we found is that this bar one is regulated by the 32 protein which requires nad and what we think is going on after chemotherapy or during aging is that the levels of nad in the ovary and in the egg are low and really it's going to send an employee and that explains why when we give nad to quite neatly precursors to eggs in vivo the eggs come out healthier more numerous and are much better at allowing for fertilization and healthy offspring I don't know much about fertility as this next question will illustrate but presumably you can still see aneuploidy on the male side so is there a male fertility opportunity here as well I realize it's not as probably as common a problem but presumably you still have to have a perfect split of the chromosome in the sperm yeah possibly it's an area that we're looking into I don't have anything solid enough to be able to say if it works or not but it in theory yeah and you just want back to something earlier is nmn available over the counter it is more recently I can see it on the

[01:16:52] Internet okay but I one of the things that I want to bring up is you can find my name all over these products not basis they're reputable but there are others that use my name all over the place meaning without your permission correct and and Harvard's permission and so I've sent more cease and desist letters you can then you can imagine and they keep popping up so that's an important point so if a listener after this talk is saying hey David Sinclair sounds like a smart reputable guy if his name's on something I should take it what can your name be associated with right now that is you know with your permission nothing okay so basically anything that's out there that's over-the-counter that has your name on it is not endorsed by correct okay thank you for clarifying that that would be frustrating uh yeah it is but I try to stay above the fray besides when you can stand on Harvard's shoulders and let their lawyers send those cease and desist letters it would be nice if that would truly what I spend a portion of my salary every year on this really that's a shame I'm sorry to hear that so fertility is a super interesting angle I would have never thought about that that strikes me as highly testable as well which you know one of the challenges of longevity research as you know better than I do is if you want to make claims in humans you better buckle up because it's gonna be it's it's almost untestable so when you look at what other companies are doing like restore bio going down the mTOR pathway they're not going after longevity right they're going after very very specific indications that are testable in shorter periods of time in a respiratory failure or things like that what are the other disease states that you think would be most exciting if you don't already have plans to go down that from your pharmacologic standpoint well we we've been targeting diseases that are rare and have a high unmet need so I can't divulge all of those because that's all that's company stuff but the fertility part that's very clear I'm able to tell you that those trials will begin next year in IVF clinics and that will be the first way first time a doctor looks at those eggs from a woman she'll probably or she'll probably know that it's working or not so that's very clear when you say company we're so we're sitting right now in a headquarters that is the name of its what they call is as life bioscience yes and that's a parent company or sort of tell me how that fits into a number of the scientific entities that you're involved in so like

[01:19:13] Biosciences is a family of companies that uses shared resources and knowledge there are eight of us right now that work on different aspects of Aging not just nad biology but the usual suspects all the major hallmarks of Aging then we could list off each one of these companies has world leaders and drug development programs in that so that we think we can quote unquote conquer aging from different aspects but together we're stronger as one unified company life Biosciences earlier you spoke about sort of eight or nine central tenants of

[01:19:47] Aging we've covered some of them but I know and I'm guessing that your book is going to go into this in greater detail but can you rehash what you at least as many of those is you're gonna recall on the spot not that put you on the spot that's a long list yeah sure there's epigenetic changes cells or cell communication and information there's let me count this analytics so senescence cells build up and there's protein misfolding there's telling me a loss and genomic instability there's metabolic changes so in P kinase in him metformin would address that and then there's a responses to what it called amino acids and other nutrient inputs and those collectively go awry during aging but what causes all of those to happen that's something that we've been working on for quite a while and you think those are more coupled than they are uncoupled those pathways or do you think that I mean there are clearly situations in which external stressors can perturb more than one of those but like senescence seems somewhat uncoupled from nutrient sensing doesn't it it may but and I'm not asking that rhetorically like I just I just don't know that no the answer is what we think that we've found an explanation for all of these things to happen a unifying theory right so I've kept it close to my vest for a number of years but it actually goes all the way back to the sort to in story in yeast and hopefully that the listeners who have stuck with this podcast are still with us because they yeah they promise you they are with us so the punchline is that so this is all off top my head here we haven't published this yet but I'm gonna tell you my my thoughts and your listeners so the genome is digital information it's very easy to preserve to reason we went from analog to digital and in 2000 DNA is four letters it's digital it's easy to replicate easy to store you can boil it it's very robust that's what we've actually come to discover is that the genome is fairly intact in old people and old animals we've sequenced the genomes of lots of old mice and all the genes are still largely intact so what's going wrong well the other part of information that you inherit from your parents is the epigenetic information okay and I use that term loosely but basically it means what's the pattern of gene expression which genes to turn on and off at which time and that is analog information okay that has to be analog because instead of just being a single code it has to operate in three dimensions actually four if you count time and so that's an analog system and it's constantly adapting to what we eat what we what we drink if we run when we sleep and you have to turn genes on and off all the time but that pattern of gene expression that's set down when we're young because it's analog analog information doesn't last very long anyone who's had a record player or magnetic tape knows that these things don't last and that's the problem

[01:22:43] I think with aging is that we don't lose the digital information so the compact discs of our lives is still intact when we're old but it's as if we've got a scratch CD and the cells don't read the right genes at the right time anymore and they lose their identity in fact if we there's a analogy which is called

[01:23:00] Warrington's landscape where in the 1950s Waddington grew a picture it's a beautiful picture of some hills it's a mountain scape and cells actually roll down the mountain scape and land in different valleys down below and that's - before we had he had access to the genome that was his way of saying this is how cells know what they are they land in these valleys and they stay there but what I think is happening during aging is due to the vibration of noise over time we lose that pattern of gene expression we lose that information of genetic information and those cells or those marbles in Warrington's landscape they jump over into different valleys and lose their identity so your neurons are not functioning like neurons anymore your liver cells and more like neurons and we see that in our lab we're just writing up a couple of papers right now for this and we're able to actually manipulate the epigenome in cells and in mice and have a look what happens to those animals and the prediction is that you get all the hallmarks of aging you know the challenge with this entire space is you think back to the time in the 1950s when he made when he created that now and it's in some ways it's amazing that it could still be relevant 75 80 years later whatever it is on the other hand it it humbles you to realize how much more has been learned about that process in that time and sometimes I think about it because you and I are interested in the same problem that I'm worried I just don't know anything you know I'm worried that in 10 years I'll look back at my hypotheses and my under not even my hypothesis just my understanding of the current state of they are today and think you know what that was directionally right but it was so oversimplified and oh my goodness like you know sort like we're back in this problem of time like we're gonna run out of time and I mean how confident are you that in cos you and I are almost the same age like how confident are you that in our lifetime we will see step function changes in human longevity and to put this in context there really hasn't been a step function change in human longevity probably since the introduction of sanitation I mean everything has been quite incremental maybe antibiotics vaccinations antibiotics have probably been the last step function change will we see one in our lifetime how confident are you I'm getting more and more confident honestly when I I started in this field

[01:25:23] I thought we'd probably not see the type of technologies that I'm seeing now it's making my head spin not just in the technologies but also they are the investment and the number of people working on this now this was the backcourt of biology when we started and there's been some new results which I'll just hint upon because um we haven't published and it's very early but I've seen it sounds like a scene out of Blade Runner but I've seen things you wouldn't believe it's maybe not that dramatic but let me go back to the compact disc analogy you've got the scratched CD how do you find the Polish what is that let's go back to the yeast analogy what causes those scratches why do you get loss of gene regulation anyone who is paying attention earlier on in this conversation will remember that these DNA breaks in the chromosome broken chromosomes distract the surra complex and they move away and you get the expression of genes that have no right being on it means is the sirtuins huh lost they're distracted from the deactivation function and they're dealing with the repair function exactly so using that what we've got a lot of evidence for now is that something very similar if not essentially identical in principle happens in mammals as we age and what that means is that insults to the genome and one of the major insults is a double strand break but there probably others cause these proteins sirtuins and other factors are not saying only so transmitted factors that control gene expression silencing and other things have a dual role we know in

[01:26:53] DNA repair and other things such as responding to stressors heat whatever but this is the cells way of coordinating gene expression changes hunkering down during times of adversity and going off to repair the system which in this case we study DNA breaks and that's a beautiful system when you're young it works great you get exposed to cosmic rays or you go out in the Sun you've got lots of DNA breaks eventually these proteins will go repair those breaks and then go back to where they came from to settle down the response to turn off the inflammation to turn off the DNA repair when it's not needed but the problem we think is it's antagonistic pleiotropy okay so Peter

[01:27:33] Medawar and the other brilliant scientists in the 50s speculated I think correctly is that things that are really good for you when you're young come back to bite you in the ass when you're older and I think that's what's happening here is that this response to these stressors like a break end up not just distracting these proteins but end up disrupting the actual structure of our chromatin and these proteins don't always go back to where they came from a hundred percent do that for 70 or 80 years and it's not surprising that the genes that were once perfectly programmed and turned on at the right time lose their ability to do that and we've got remnants of that program when were a 70 and 80 but what's exciting is that information is still there to be accessed the question is how do you get the cells to remember to access at the right time what's that polish and I think we're pretty close to finding that if you had unlimited resources and not just financial resources but sort of metaphysical resources like any experiment would be ethical you could do something that no today no IRB would have prove is there an experiment that you would wish to see done that could accelerate our knowledge in this space log fold you mean staying within with within an ethical law yeah this but you know for example like you know to do a human experiment in longevity would be ethical but impractical because of the duration of time but if I gave you like a time machine and an infinite amount of resources tell me what the most elegant experiment you can think of that would again just leapfrog our knowledge okay so the experiment that needs to be done whether it's with metformin or other drugs and development including these rapper logs and the nmn and nad precursors you should take a group of five thousand people that would be sufficient and just give them the medicine wait three four years and you'd know from that number of people that you're changing the hazard ratio the mortality rate you'd have to start with people probably in their 70s I think that was the calculation that I did but you don't need to wait a whole lifetime to know that these things well so this is basically Neer's argument yeah exactly what news not doing mortality as much as he's doing healthspan but it's exactly right you do enough people I mean it's gonna cost tens of millions of dollars but think of the trillions of dollars that would be saved if we can prove this but but if I'm gonna play devil's advocate for a moment what if by doing that experiment we are missing the opportunity the window of opportunity for these drugs to act in other words you know we know that caloric restriction is less and less effective the longer you wait in the organism at least within mice and that's what made rapamycin so interesting is you could it was blew everybody away that you could start this drug on mice that were six hundred days old and they still had you know 9% 14% increase in law and lifespan if you had more time do you think we could get a more clear answer starting earlier acknowledging that you'd have to wait longer if you wanted to use a hard outcome like do you worry that we would risk doing this in people in their eighth decade that it might not work but that just tells us that it doesn't work late not that it doesn't work period I don't worry about that we could with enough capital week and money invested we could do multiple different experiments we could do people in their 50s 60s 70s and 80s so let you know dream with me the other thing that makes me optimistic is it's not just recognizing that works late in life we've got results in my lab now that we'll be publishing that if we start even later than 600 days in a mouse which is what close it to 70% yeah we can still extend lifespan using what I know you were this is not gonna tell you we're using the nmn okay so there are multiple ways to and certainly when you use nmn in the lab are you also using like a PT analog or a respiratory analog are you able to just use NMM and see just the the natural molecule work we're now gearing up to do then this is not in high-fat overfed animals this is in wild-type animals we just put it in the drinking water oh because nmn is more soluble so interesting yeah but we've got better molecules that we're now testing we think that we can be well again try to be rather Meissen and maybe a combination do you think there's overlap in those pathways yeah yeah we're both thinking the same thing yeah actually the combination yeah yeah yeah and I want to take the combination one day well we now actually have some early data I don't want to scoop myself but we're able to know genetically modified adult mice with a V the virus a 1000 C 8 a virus and we can now genetically change a mouse so we've just put in all seven sort own genes into it not into mice in old mice you've put the seven human cert genes into mice Oh seven else gentle Mouse but that sort of experiment would have taken a decade to do just a few years ago but now that we can deliver genes we can do very quickly strummers not only that we can also do that multiplex we can do combinations of germ and combination of molecules so even experiment and yeah you're stacking the matrix now well yeah I mean we should be doing this it's just a matter of resources but I think we're now at a point in the aging community where these combinations need to be tested it's the question that's that's on everybody's mind what happens if you put them in combination are they better or worse together and so what we've done is we've put all servants or two and genes into a mouse and fed them so many men to give them the fuel and the genetic requirement and interestingly there are additive effects when you do both of those things and this is how we're able to see these dramatic effects in these old knives so is your optimism towards the NAD precursor space and these are to an activating space equivalent or do you and you see them as necessarily parallel paths um they have different uses the

[01:33:18] NAD is where I'm mostly focused on now become is that because of the observed age-related decline in nad in part but it's also because in theory all of the seventh or two and should be good and that lack of nad could be the main problem that's going on in in older people and so the idea is that instead of just activating once or two and which is what resveratrol did we think you can potentially activate all seven of them and replenish what's been lost over time and I think seven is probably better than one you mentioned at the outset of this discussion that you were four years old when you became aware of mortality was there something that occurred that made you aware of mortality at such a young age I had an unusual grandmother who was brutally honest with me she would never lie in any question I asked

[01:34:05] I was and you were probably very precocious and curious I suppose I was but yet she would never lie so my question that most kids have is are you always gonna be around she didn't even you couldn't call her grandma she wanted to use her first name which is Vera so fury you guys always going around of course not I'm gonna die yeah but what about mom and dad yeah they're gonna die what about my cat it's gonna die and then of course you're thinking if they're all gonna die what's gonna happen to me you know and then but it turns out all kids go through this it's being studied extensively that between the ages of four and seven kids understand that there's death and at first they're in denial they say well maybe those adults will divert my teachers and my parents they're not gonna die but then by age seven it's undeniable all kids know that everything around them that's living at one day will die including themselves but it's very interesting when it happens at age seven is it's buried deep in the subconscious and you very rarely think about it until you have to because I don't think as a species we could get by for all running around oh my God we're gonna die one day so seven-year-olds onward till about 50 you try not to think about it that's pretty common you start looking at yourself in the mirror at 50 you notice your teeth are wearing out and you feel a little bit of age you see some wrinkles you think oh yeah crap this is really happening and you know we think more and more about it

[01:35:23] I'm unusual because I work on this every day so I'm always thinking about it but I think on average when I talk to people especially in their 20s and 30s it's not something that is on their radar because it's gonna see something happens in a distant future that they're not even looking at do you have kids I have three how old are they oh they are 15 13 and how do you explain what you do to them

[01:35:43] I was just as brutal to them as yeah and actually I saw my my oldest daughter go through this I tell all my kids but it was more dramatic to see it for the first time myself and I gave a TED talk about this when I told her that I was gonna die she burst out crying and for a week couldn't sleep it was traumatic and you know maybe I'm a cruel parent but I also try not to BS my kids either but what I saw with her was what even I think most kids do including myself was you just can't think about it it drives you not you going sleep so she forgot about it and we've never talked about it ever again and even if I talk about death she says shut up don't want to hate her about it and she probably won't think about it in a big way until I'm old or her grandparents are dying David this has been a really interesting discussion I want to be sensitive to your time I think the listeners of this podcast will be upset to know that we're only going for about you know an hour and 40 minutes instead of the usual three or four hours but where can people find you on social media and what how do you like to interact with people that have questions besides adding to the list of the thousands of emails you get a day yeah emails I can't reply to everyone but on social media I'm now on your social media I find that's a good way to communicate with people and so I have a twitter handle which is David a Sinclair oh and I'm also on LinkedIn but we're putting together a social media page so we can have a discussion it's now there's so many people interested in this you know any information that's locked in my head seems to be on demand so that's how I want to reach people this book is coming out which has me regurgitating and vomiting on the page everything from what we've learned in my life with my kids all the way through to understanding why we age in this universal hypothesis that we're putting

[01:37:30] I'm putting forward and then the consequences of what happens when we do this now it's not a question of if anymore it so when it's gonna happen what happens to planet Earth what happens to humanity what happens to your family as this starts to come out and some good some bad what have to get ready for economically socially and it's all gonna be in there well I really look forward to reading it you know I'm in the midst of writing a book as well and

[01:37:54] I'm guessing you struggled with the same thing I'm struggling with which is not just the writing of it but more importantly you almost don't want to hand the thing in because you know that the day you hand it in there's something new that you're gonna want that you're gonna know something more and so as we were talking about it before we started the podcast like you submit these books a full year before they hit the press and then of course it basically is a static document until you know sure you could have an online updated to information or but did you struggle with that especially I think you know people like us I think have a little bit of a humility around the half-life of facts and that's time that that sounds like a very you know sort of pompous thing for us to say but I just think we have the luxury of knowing that basically whatever we know today is you know quite likely to not be entirely true tomorrow how did you cope with that this is now just a very personal question for me as

[01:38:47] I'm struggling with this phenomenal yeah you're a perceptive computer that so I'm also one of those guys that I'm at the podium about to give a talk to a thousand people and I'm still changing my PowerPoint slides I'm a just obsessed with perfection and that's one of my downfalls same thing with the book I've been writing it for 10 years and it's needed updating of course even to the point that last night I was editing it

[01:39:09] I've already turned it into my editor three weeks ago you're a nightmare to the editor and she's received probably seven updates already and I'm gonna stop I promised but every time I wake up there's something more really interesting to add that I want to put in there and you know a year from now I think it's gonna be an even better book than it is now but I'm really happy with everything I've gotten down on the page because when I talk to people people write to me every day I'm able to answer questions I think burning in a lot of people's minds well David this has been great

[01:39:40] I find it it's sometimes hard to talk to people you don't know until the day of the podcast which is the case here but I found there's a common language that we that we speak or maybe a common passion not a common language this is a topic that's new to me but anyway this has been really exciting and I I can't thank you enough for your time well I appreciate the opportunity and I'm really enjoying it too Thanks you can find all of this information and more at
