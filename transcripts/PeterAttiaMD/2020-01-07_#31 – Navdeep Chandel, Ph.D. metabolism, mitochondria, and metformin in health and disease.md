[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:40] hi everybody welcome to today's episode of the drive my guest today is my good friend Navdeep or nav as we like to call him chandell have is a professor of medicine and cell and molecular biology at Northwestern in Chicago which is where I actually met him to do this interview some of you may recall that name because nav is one of the cast of characters that I went to Easter Island with in the fall of 2016 the other being

[00:01:09] David Sabatini and Tim Ferriss and we actually spoke about this stuff at length on a podcast that Tim recorded while we were on Easter Island nabs real area of expertise is in the mitochondria and in metabolism and in fact he wrote a book called navigating metabolism no pun intended in 2015 which I highly recommend for anybody especially people who want to understand this stuff and B don't want to have to buy seventeen textbooks and get into every unearthly detail this book this book was written more for a general audience than a very specific audience and I have a copy of it and loved it in this episode we talked about a bunch of stuff but we talked about what got nav interested in the mitochondria we get into Ross or reactive oxygen species something that I think many of you will have heard of and then we talked about some really nuanced stuff like this stuff about mitochondria being actual signaling organelles and Ross may be being beneficial for that signaling in other words we get into this idea that reactive oxygen species may not be all bad it might not be a black-white thing which anyone who listen to this podcast realize we love to explore things that aren't just binary we talk about antioxidants and whether they're harmful or not harmful and I suspect that a lot of people will have a point of view on that and we get into mitochondrial DNA which and of itself is super interesting because some of you may already know this and if you don't that's fine you'll learn it on this episode but the mitochondria have their own DNA distinct from the cell and that DNA is of bacterial origin it's also transmitted to us maternally so there's a whole bunch of weird stuff going on genetically with the mitochondria that makes it super interesting we get into a little bit of a discussion around cortisol and have is super interested in the role of cortisol in health and then we talk of course about metformin and I suspect that for some people listening to this that's the only thing they're gonna care about because these days everybody's asking me about metformin which means it's front and center on a lot of people's minds with respect to longevity now we don't even go as deep as we could on metformin I'm saving that for another guest that's in the queue who I'm not gonna even say too much about that but there's a lot more coming on metformin this however will be a great primer for that because you'll certainly understand how Matt Foreman works and how it may play a role in longevity we talk about the role of the mitochondria in cancer and again we take a different view here from what you will have heard from other guests potentially we talked about nad and NADP recursos and that again is another thing that people I think are pretty excited about at the end somehow nab jiu jitsu x' me and turns the tables on me and asks me the so what should I eat question which anybody who knows me knows I can't stand being asked that question but because it's nav I humored him a little bit before we jump into that please keep in mind we have an email list every Sunday morning I send out an email and that email has a whole bunch of stuff in it it's usually pretty short though but it's basically something I've read that's interesting that pertains to longevity science lipid ology performance or just something that really interests me beyond those things keep in mind we put I would say an ungodly amount of effort into preparing show notes and when I say we I'm using that term very liberally I actually do none of that but I have a team that does that and that is spearheaded by Travis and Bob so the people who do spend time on those show notes always come back to us with feedback like this is freaking awesome please keep doing this and our intention is to keep doing that so give us a reason to keep doing that by going and checking them out especially when it comes to understanding some of the technical stuff that we talk about here and getting some of the references and lastly if you are digging this podcast please head over to Apple podcast reviews and leave us a review especially if it's positive but if it's negative at least have the courtesy to give us some constructive feedback so we can improve upon whatever it is you don't like so without anything further to add please welcome nav gender enough good to see you again man wait to see you Peter yeah the last time I saw you me you and

[00:05:10] David Sabatini were hanging out near the airport in San Diego playing patty-cakes you guys were drinking some really lame stuff roses I like sparkling stuff so what got you interested with mitochondria so when I was in college I was a math major I love math right I probably didn't matter because as an immigrant you moved from the Himalayas to Miami got a funny accent math is a universal language right so you I became a math geek but everybody's gotta make a living and so I worked in a laboratory which was in a hospital and it was a transplant laboratory and the biggest thing in transplant is how do you preserve organs I mean you have an MD I don't have an MD I think that's a fair statement and there's this Wisconsin solution that was used to reuse it liberally you live yeah and so I wanted to make a better version of it as a 19 year old and if you've got to do that then you got to think about metabolism the first set of experiments we did and

[00:06:13] I went to a Fassett meeting and it's called 3-phosphoglycerate protects against anoxia injury of her parasites and oxy is low oxygen you know the absence of oxygen and and that got me interested metabolism if you're a mathematician and you start working metabolism and eventually mike mitochondria its electrons hits enzyme kinetics right there's math and fact my PhD is on enzyme kinetics and so

[00:06:42] I'm doing a PhD on our enzyme that's very critical for respiration so like the enzyme that uses oxygen in every cell is what I did my PhD on and how that enzyme works under different oxygen levels again lots of math I know Michaelis Menten but much more sophisticated enzyme kinetics and then after that the thing that was probably the the most influential discovery in the mitochondria field for me and I still think this is one of the three greatest discoveries in the mitochondria field of course it'll be contentious because lots of people might take issue so the first one is Hans Krebs in the

[00:07:22] TCA cycle in 37 there's a 60 paper by Peter Mitchell how you make ATP so those are the two big things right energy by energetics and biosynthesis because the Krebs cycle eventually makes carbon molecules which are the backbone for lipids nucleotides amino acid the third big experiment was came out in 1996 Zhang Wang when he was at Emory found that the protein that I used every single day to do enzyme kinetics so I worked on cytochrome C oxidase that's an enzyme already tells you cytochrome C oxidase means that's it uses cytochrome C as a substrate what let's take a step back for someone who's gonna be listening this who doesn't know everything about it before we get to wong's experiment tell us who hans krebs what he did what the TCA is a lot of people will think I kind of remember this from high school biology but give me a quick refresher course so I'll prime you a little bit for it a cell brings glucose in just to make it easy it turns glucose through a number of steps enzymatic steps into two smaller three carbon units called pyruvate assuming the demand for ATP is not extraordinary and there's sufficient cellular oxygen what would be the most efficient way to get energy out of that pyruvate has two choices it can either become lactate and usually that happens when there's not enough oxygen yeah all right the other thing I always like to say to people and or when the demand for ATP is exceptional exceptional right but the other place where it really goes is pyruvate goes into what's called a TCA cycle and it's really a cycle so where glycolysis is a series of linear steps you know ABCDE then you get to pyruvate and pyruvate actually goes in a circle and this circle in a part of the cell called the cytoplasm the glycolysis part yes but the TCA happens in the mitochondria we're gonna get through so pyruvate to lactate is all in the cytoplasm but pyruvate then gets imported to a pirate' mitochondrial pyruvate carrier and that's important because it could be a target therapeutically in certain diseases I think most of us appreciate and this is what you're getting to why you're focusing on pyruvate pyruvate has two choices go to lactate or the mitochondria so clearly the pyruvate to lactate is cytoplasmic pyruvate going into the mitochondrion eventually becoming a selca way that's an important reaction so what we're part of it goes and how it gets in and out is quite important and discovery of that transporter gives you a way to maybe target that so now pyruvates in the mitochondria mitochondria and then it's a 3 carbon and it becomes acidic away ass it'll Co is very important and what can get into it later because the Sidel Co a can

[00:10:14] Isetta late to a set of late viii means you put it on because ace is an enzyme it's the it's the end of an enzyme to take out take it off yeah yeah and then it goes through the TCA cycle which stands for so some people call it the Krebs cycle because Hans Krebs discovery zone tricarboxylic acid cycle some people call the citric acid cycle so we'll use those interchangeably and so the TCA cycle as it's going in the mitochondria it generates nadh and fadh2 these reducing equivalents which then feed electrons to the electron transport chain and the electron transport chain and can pump protons which is basically like a battery to generate ATP which is the currency of that mix you know cellular functions work so the way I like to explain this people because I think it's such it's just so damn elegant you look at a piece of food and all you see is this potential energy you see and and of course within all the bonds that exist in food which is where we get our energy from you have carbon carbon bonds carbon hydrogen bonds carbon nitrogen bonds carbon oxygen nitrogen oxygen I mean there's only a finite number of covalent bonds that exist but the two most energy dense I think are carbon carbon and carbon hydrogen correct isn't that where the majority of the chemical energy is liberated those electrons have to eventually be accepted by something and an oxygen is the final acceptor of all of those so in some sense the whole purpose of eating is to take a potential energy that is in a chemical form turn it into an electrical potential energy inside the mitochondria and then eventually pull a little jiu-jitsu and turn that back into a chemical electrical energy via the conversion of

[00:12:05] ADP to ATP I mean to me that's the simplest way to explain this and and it's just like a battery right yeah it's kind of amazing we assess why they call it a power plant yeah what is the you know in the public domain what do people call mitochondria the power plant of the cell power house power plan right and exactly the elegant explanation you just gave so we're already talking about the dogma right which is this all about ATP so if you asked in 1996 what is the major function of mitochondria make ATP that's it and for good reason because let's call a spade a spade as we know if you interrupt that cycle for even moments it's uniformly fatal most people are familiar with a toxin called cyanide cyanide is fatal at incredibly low concentration there are only a handful of toxins that are more potent more lethal at lower concentrations but and and they all tend to you know like the trota toxin I think four blocks a sodium channel transporter it might be even more lethal but why cyanide is so lethal is it disrupts that process you just described indeed but it's not clear which organ fails right away so we we'll get into that in a second the genetic experiments don't totally confirm that trivia I'd like to hear yeah we're gonna get into that in a little bit so in 1996 if you asked that question it's all about a TV and so there is this protein cytochrome C that's part of this energy energy generating system which is ATP and Zhang

[00:13:44] Wang and colleagues found that if that protein gets released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm which had never been detected before it can rapidly kill a cell so now the decision for life and death is based on the localization of cytochrome C between the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm so if it's in the mitochondria it helps you generate ATP if it's out it kills you and I assume it only escapes when the mitochondria is under the most intense duress and destruction so when a cell is under some sort of toxin stress could be low oxygen ric complete absence of oxygen could be a growth factor which is telling the cell to live is not present death by neglect let's call it that when the cell is being neglected either by nutrition starvation complete depletion of nutrients or complete depletion of growth factors that keep them happy the positive signals been cytochrome C gets released but it's a very profound discovery because this is a protein that we were all convinced had only one role we call it the day job now make a TV he's got a moonlighting job that sometimes it leaves the mitochondria and doesn't make ATP and bam it starts a cascade which is called a pitocin cell death I was just about to say it is this part of a programmed cell death is apoptosis missus program cell death so here here I am in 1996 I'm 26 years old very happy doing enzyme kinetics bioenergetics and I see this this finding and all of a sudden I stopped caring about ATP because in part a lot of that how it works more or less discovered I didn't have the insight obviously why would I be still working on and I still thought there was more to be discovered but the reality was I was probably just cleaning up little side things in that field at best and that's not hopefully to dis barge de bioenergetics field but there's still some important questions they're more at a structural level and there's some beautiful work there but you know what I was doing was the kinetics had been working on oh I mean some of it had been an odd but this was great because this connected the mitochondria just not for energy and you know what the mitochondria does it almost in a Cell I like in an autonomous way like it just does ATP but this says it starts to control cell biology and function like the decision of life and death so obviously the first thing we think about is it can't be selected just for death right it must be doing something interesting so let's think about what else it might release and one of the first things that we thought about which is something that people had noticed for almost 40 50 years before they release super oxide and hydrogen peroxide reactive oxygen species oxidants free radicals and most people in the mid 90s assumed that mitochondria only released this so-called cleaning molecule at a toxic molecule when the mitochondria is damaged maybe in near degeneration maybe an aging we'll get into this maybe when a heart failure when there's low oxygen ischemia so in other words is there almost as a way that the mitochondria when it's not working well it just spills out because mitochondria is all these electrons and and they have to and they're not working those electrons to spill into superoxide and eventually to hydrogen peroxide and what we thought about is well maybe nature could have used that as a signaling molecule in other words to dictate cellular function and so there were some papers just right as we were working that came out and it's showed in fact h2o2 could be a signaling molecule but they didn't think it was necessarily mitochondria so there was a neat little story that there's another system in the cytoplasm that can generate h2 or two and they thought that's all about signaling signaling basically means it's making decisions in the cell to die to live to proliferate to grow if you're an immune cell to make cytokines to do inflammation but the mitochondria only did it when it's not working and it's spilling all these electrons into hydrogen peroxide and it's causing damage and we actually showed that in fact under physiological conditions you can make hydrogen peroxide aid which has a beneficial effect and so from that point on but the first paper was published in 98 now almost 20 years there's my group and lots of other people continue to show that mitochondrial generation of this cleaning molecule can actually cause cellular functions to happen for example we've shown our T cells which are part of the adaptive immune system right they fight off pathogens right or innate immune cells as well just this immunity in general right their fight off viral infections bacterial infections that h2o2 is used by those immune cells to properly function and what's the profound implication which is what you're gonna get into is antioxidants are they beneficial are they harmful so already to the audience it should be obvious if I'm saying that something you think is a cleaning molecule only that antioxidants are great you're getting rid of this toxic molecule cleaning molecule you're getting rid of this bad stuff but it if it's also there for good purposes like immune function paradoxically could be bad to have an antioxidant in your system at a time when you need enhanced especially adaptive immunity and so one of the clinical trials that came out was in the

[00:19:45] ICU sepsis room that's the big disease and which is basically in a simplistic level tons of inflammation and those trials failed they made him worse antioxidant trials in cancer again in lung cancer my Damini trial didn't have a curative effect yeah do you think it's overly simplistic to say that there ought to be a balance in the body between Pro oxidative and antioxidative stress and it's never the case that one is absolutely good or absolutely bad it depends on the state of the organism so under perhaps a normal state a more antioxidants is the right thing to do but to your point when the immune system is required to take the front step cancer and sepsis being too enormous examples that having too much antioxidant property can actually be harmful and that's a moment when you actually wanna be able to inhibit that process so one of the interesting antioxidant trials now again caveat in this experiment I'm going to tell you is an exercise experiment so we all agree that if you do vigorous exercise it has benefits and you can take a biopsy and look at all the genes that exercise turns on and these are genes we think are beneficial to the host to the rest of the body if you give high doses of antioxidants so that's the caveat it's high doses probably not the doses that most people use it actually turns off that beneficial response so in other words to your point I think what you're making is that when the system is stressed and the mitochondria integrates that stress how does it pass that information back to the cell we think that perhaps it releases hydrogen peroxide so like clearly exercise is a good example right that's a stress to the system to your muscle and how does that muscle then turn on all these genes and blah blah blah so we think it does it perhaps by releasing hydrogen peroxide prior to this insight now is it the case that people knew the mitochondria was signaling but assume there was a different molecule that was used to transmit the message or the people didn't actually think the mitochondria were playing any role in signaling and this we're still back in the ATP only paradigm they did think about signaling only in the context of pathology so in other words so there are these childhood diseases likely syndrome where there's a mitochondrial mutation in a particular protein and there's a devastating disease the kids don't live that long as clearly that's a mitochondrial mutation and a protein that gets mutated doesn't function properly in the mitochondria and you get a childhood disease so how does that work so people say well probably ATP or maybe some maybe too much Ross that's right so it's in that context there was some idea of signaling right because but this is saying under physiological conditions exercise is not pathology is physiologic when you get a pathogen in other words when you get a virus or bacteria that's that happens you get a cold your immune system has to be activated that's not pathology that's a good normal response so under all those conditions though the mitochondria is playing a signaling role and so I've coined this term you know so there's the mitochondria as powerhouses so my talks and ever talk about that the title of every talk I give all around the world is the same not very original anymore mitochondria as signaling organelles and h2o2 is one way cytochrome C is another way right that's wrong maybe the most original because that's for celled that by the way 22 years later do we still think that that were out of Emory is what has been added to that body of knowledge about the role of in in apoptosis in program cell death they know the whole pathway but it is still coming from the single enzyme yeah yeah yeah Wow they're these proteins called backs and back then make these pores in the mitochondria and it releases this 13 kilo Dalton protein just it just releases that protein right out and then it binds to a whole bunch of other proteins a path one and caspase-9 and starts this proteolytic pathway which eventually causes cell death so they've worked out all the biochemistry but the main point remains there's actually yes Wow that's that's you don't get that all the time in biology that 22 years later the punchline is still the same the punchline is the same I mean you know there's a lot of details that have to be but conceptually yeah are there other ways by the way that the cells can undergo apoptosis now there's a whole industry every day there's a new and in fact we can talk about one new one which I'm very excited about so clearly we can show that h2o2 in many contexts will signal for positive responses immune functions as we just talked about the exercise response er but clearly there must be cases where h2o2 o or other reactive oxygen species cause cell death how does that work and there is a new form of cell that that was just discovered by Brent Stockwell and Scott

[00:25:03] Dixon at Columbia you know 11 or so 2011 and they is called fare up ptosis is and it's basically taking h2o2 if there's free iron you can make a hydroxyl radical and OAH and that will then make a lipid hydro peroxide so if you have polyunsaturated fatty acids it will basically make it into a lipid hydro peroxide which can be very toxic so the bottom line is there are times where hydrogen peroxide with iron and lipids that three can come together and make something called a lipid hydro peroxide which will cause cell death in fare up doses the good thing is your body's full of an enzyme called GPX for that gets rid of it all the time now if you don't have that enzyme you're in big trouble so there are places where clearly h2o 2 is positive and it can become very lethal by making another form of reactive oxygen species but again Nature has selected you know I can't count all of them but at least 30 enzymes which are constantly mopping up these reactive oxygen species keeping them quite low so you don't get to those toxic levels so when we go back to apoptosis which I didn't think we're gonna even talk about this but it's so great to be able to bring it up because I think for many people that they're still probably thinking what are we talking about apoptosis so if a cell undergoes a genetic mutation nuclear genetic will come back to mitochondrial genes later but if a cell undergoes a genetic mutation in the nucleus that's unrecoverable it will on a good day kill itself it will commit suicide and that would be one of the things that would drive a pop toad you're getting to tumor suppression mechanism yes exactly right that's where

[00:26:47] I'm going okay do we know if this mechanism you just described of apoptosis plays a role in the type of cancer apoptosis that we want to see and if so the implication is the nuclear genome must be communicating with the mitochondria yes so there is a drug that targets that Abbott main a good friend of mine Steve Vesak was involved in it who's now at Vanderbilt and so in the 90s they figured out the structure of a of a particular protein that controls cytochrome C release and so they've made a drug hug against that protein in and specifically in cancer or to make the cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapy basically right so what do cancer cells love to do they up regulate anti-apoptotic proteins right so what does that mean that means they they turn on a whole program which is basically an anti-death program right protects them from everything you just described this release of cytochrome C and all that stuff and so one idea is why don't we target those anti-apoptotic proteins these anti-death proteins and it's because if we can target them and prevent them from functioning then when we give them chemotherapy not the cells will die a lot quicker the problem chemotherapy is all these anti dead proteins are there so a normal cell like you know so doxy Rubin is a good case a normal cell of being a heart gets toxicity at the same time you're trying to kill the cancer cells so it's not selected it's not selective right and so people have been targeting these anti-apoptotic proteins and in cancer as a mechanism to make chemotherapy more effective yeah so this mechanism we were talking from 1996 anything we would get into this but it's been a long time this is my previous life haven't thought about this in a long time but yeah it still applies then is very important for cancer so while we're still going on history I'm just alluded to something a moment ago that I think is an important point for the for the listener to understand which is you know everybody knows or I guess you know most people who were thinking about biology would understand that the part of the cell that contains your DNA is called the nucleus and we've got lots of genes in there about 20,000 genes but the mitochondria has genes too not that many what is like 35 or something yes 37 and there's the key point there is there's 13 genes that are essential for the respiratory chain to work and the respiratory chain is where all that oxygen is being consumed that's the one that makes that energy that electrochemical energy we talked about that ultimately gets converted to ATP so the key subunits of the respiratory chain what generates that battery that we've been talking about it holds on to those 13 genes that are critical for it so for example complex one and is one of those respiratory chains there's these five complexes from one of the complexes 45 subunits but a few of them which means 45 proteins make this huge complex but a few of them are in in the mitochondrial genome complex 3 very important my favorite complex everybody's gotta have a favorite complex and so my favorite I see a t-shirt yeah yeah so my favorite complex is complex 3 and it has one gene that's still in the mitochondria by the way are you saying that just to be contrarian because complex one is actually the coolest because like how can having complex one not be your favorite mitochondrial complex I'll tell you in a second like it's just cuz you're cool and you're you're too cool for school because you study this the rest of us who are in the peanut gallery we we default into complex one being the coolest so you're saying I'm a mitochondrial hipster right I think you are you're leading the charge on us no but think you know complex 3 is very interesting because it has 11 you know one of only one subunit is in the mitochondrial encoded by the mitochondrial genome so so at one point the mitochondria so going back in evolution we think there was an alpha

[00:30:52] Proteobacteria and in archaea probably a message n' and these two prokaryotes got together and had a symbiotic love affair and just to explain through these so we are you carry obviously you carry and what does that mean again we've got a nucleus we've got a bunch of organelles and what's a prokaryote it doesn't have those org got it so bacteria so you got a bacteria and you got an archaea and they got together so we think the archaea is kind of where the nucleus came from and the

[00:31:20] Alpha Proteobacteria is a modern-day mitochondria and one of the best evidence is I remember an experiment that I did as a graduate student and was I took a bacteria that somebody had discovered in the 70s a beautiful paper in nature and this bacteria if you gave it like succinate well like a mitochondrial substrate and it'll grow on it and it would respire very similar to modern-day bacterium modern-day mitochondria Wow a nice elegant proof of concept that the mitochondria are basically bacteria it came from back here yeah they came from bacteria yeah I mean you know those who doubt evolution

[00:31:59] I always tell them that every organism I know burns glucose very similarly it is hard to make that yeah if you if you if you're not that I want to go down this path it will simply alienate a million people but but it is interesting to think like it strikes me as it's very hard to come up with an alternative explanation for why you would have this effectively foreign DNA inside every cell and I just I'm so intrigued by this mitochondrial DNA thing because again it's such a tiny number of genes on a relative scale but yet they're so critical and to my knowledge is I don't think there's any other organelle that carries its own genes with it is there no it doesn't and and what's interesting is that it only encodes for like a 1% of you know there's I don't know 1,000 proteins in the mitochondria critical you knock those 37 genes out no you knock out any one of those genes out you're done you're done and so why did the mitochondria hold on to those right so I basically gave up you know if it has a thousand proteins I said you know what the nuclear genome you take I'm gonna hold on and and they're all the critical catalytic subunits and all of this and another was they're really essential for the function and I'm gonna hold on to them it's almost like it doesn't trust it's symbiotic partner right right it's like a love affair right yeah love you but I'm gonna hold on to a few things yeah and it's very interesting because I believe I could be wrong but I

[00:33:32] I you could make the case and correct me if I'm wrong that that we pay a price for that lack of trust in many ways don't you think that nucleus would be a better steward of those genes doesn't the nucleus have more ways to protect the genome than the mitochondria and therefore don't we run a greater risk of disease when the mitochondria with its beautiful stewardship over its precious 37 genes gets under stress yeah this is a very important point you're making basically we have a lot of DNA repair enzymes right they're all in the nucleus there's these proteins called histones that cover the the double strand DNA so you know and there's many mechanisms to protect our genome and the mitochondrial

[00:34:19] DNA is just like this round little circle so vulnerables totally vulnerable and is especially vulnerable because the site of those free radicals we've been talking about is right exactly that's the worst part you put these very exposed fragile not protected genes in the presence of a potential toxin right

[00:34:40] I mean III wish I had more time to think about I wish I was quicker on my feet cuz I think I could think of it an elegant analogy of how counterintuitive it is right it's like leaving the keys to the kingdom in the hands of the guy next to the you know I can't even think of it I'm not smart enough but like yeah it doesn't make sense it's like a hat it's like a hen house next to what are the foxes like yeah yeah yeah that's that's a better so what's the advantage of it one thing I should stress is that potential molecule that could be damaging in superoxide hydrogen peroxide all hydroxyl radicals the mitochondria where the mitochondrial DNA resides in the mitochondrial matrix there's tons and tons of antioxidants there so even though that the DNA's itself can be protected it's protected from a variety of these toxins because there's so many proteins that essentially the highest level of antioxidant activity sitting the mitochondrial matrix and I think that's because to protect that that almost naked DNA so one other that makes sense ya know it really makes sense nah thank you because I've this has been on my mind a lot lately because I saw a paper recently I may have even sent it to you about another hypothesis around inflammation the affected inflammation can have on the mitochondria and the mitochondria starts to shed its DNA which actually kicks off an immune response as it exits the cell and that's what got me thinking about this I was like wait a minute that's a really good point that must happen an awful lot and actually what did they peg it to they pegged it to hypercortisolism back to because you're kind of a cortisol guy too when it's all said and done you're a cortisol file if the head word exists no you know in the hormone world they call people like you insulin prophets and many of your other former guests I'm the cortisol prophet right I think that's the missing link for a lot of stuff without any real data but it's just my own into well the these data the these data that I saw actually suggested that the hypercortisolism another glucocorticoids and and including other hormones from the adrenal glands could really become toxic to the mitochondria at high enough doses and it was basically jettisoning broken strands of mitochondrial DNA that basically you know kicked off immune responses and and and sort of you had these inflammatory responses that resulted from an immune response to mitochondrial DNA being damaged by cortisol so bringing it back to kind of inner table trivia the other thing about mitochondrial DNA that's interesting is it comes from one parent so yeah tell us what that's all about and why that's the case and what the you know we don't yeah I mean again two big questions in the field one is why we still keep those genes we just went over right you know it's kind of like it doesn't trust and then the other one is why does it come from the mom and there's an implication there which is you have far less dilution by generation you you do but why did Nature select that I don't know I don't you know I don't have a good explanation even teleologically you don't have

[00:37:52] I really don't we think more about the function of mitochondria I mean there's a whole group of people who think about the bottleneck of mitochondrial DNA being passed on but I actually I don't have a good explanation to it it's a fascinating I think lots of people have very interesting ideas around it but to be honest with you why we continue to have those genes and why does it come from the mom I think these are still outstanding questions in the field something that my lab doesn't work on and you know as you know Peter I don't comment on things said I don't work on just because you can speculate but you want to have good data but I do want to talk about one aspect of mitochondrial

[00:38:33] DNA and this is in my real house which has nothing to do with those two questions which is a third role but going back to signaling all right so if you think that h2o2 so what is mitochondria dump into the cytoplasm ATP for energy we thing h2o - for signaling you know to do immune responses exercise etc what else could it release well one of the things that could release is mitochondrial DNA which would then kick off an immune response the only thing about that hypothesis that I struggle with is how do you release mitochondrial

[00:39:08] DNA in a physiological way without not releasing much cytochrome C so you're saying maybe all the damage that's well okay I'll give you an answer I'm making this up now but maybe you are also releasing cytochrome C the cytochrome C results in the a pop tonic death of this cell but the DNA gets into the plasma which is where the immune system begins to recognize it so you could still have a pop ptosis at the cellular level but globally right so locally apoptosis globally you have the immune response right so it depends on that cell die yes which makes sense that's okay you're saying I don't see a way that that could happen with an intact cell just willy-nilly passing off its mitochondrial DNA that makes sense yeah so that's and and then people have sort of proposed I could do that and and and maybe can I'm open to the idea but someone's got to show me how you selectively released some mitochondrial

[00:40:03] DNA with releasing everything else else you know and we're h2o to an ATP get released in a much more benign fashion without ATP has an active trans it has an active chance to o2 goes by diffusion we think so probably maybe v-tach channels voltage dependent an ion channels curve maybe release the superoxide it which then gets converted quickly to h2 o2 right outside the mitochondria so again the mechanisms of you know it's kind of like water right before the aquaporins we just thought water just you're a fusion now there's active transport actually pioneer was at your Institute at Hopkins right got the Nobel Prize for the aquaporin I didn't know that yeah and so when we think about signaling the simple idea is what gets released

[00:40:51] ATP what gets released without cytochrome C getting released that's the key right because cytochrome C gets released it doesn't matter it doesn't matter everything is the cells on its way to die so what gets released so we know hydrogen peroxide ATP and metabolites metabolites are always being released so citrate well co2 co2 is really but citrate right so citrate is very interesting molecule situated gets exported from the TCA cycle into the cytoplasm where it can get broken down back into a little Co a which can then be a primer for making new lipids new fatty acids right so and but also that acetyl co a can cause a set elation reactions like on histones to control gene expression and the so called chromatin modification meaning it goes back to the nucleus yeah so but that's quite so citric could be a signaling molecule right sound well if it's doing what you just described it would be it would be right and so there's a bunch of so in my wheelhouse the ones that I like to think about H 2 O 2 and TCA cycle metabolites that get released and they do they're they're in constant flux between the cytoplasm and the TCA cycle and they can control gene expression through chromatin modifications through histone modifications so because we're gonna come back to this through a totally different lens I want to also have you and/or me explain somewhat to the listener what this idea means of histone deacetylation and and and basically because because those terms I think are largely foreign to even you know reasonably informed folks but I think the reasonably informed folk will understand what epi genome means what a modification of a gene means and how genes are potentially silenced or up regulated is that happening often in the mitochondrial DNA as well or are they pretty much just on their own they don't have so what transcription factors tell those genes when to turn on again they're all a nuclear encoded and they have to be true oh my god it's this is so staggeringly inefficient there has to be a reason for this that hasn't yeah why you know I mean I know you're fascinated by mitochondrial DNA and I don't have a good answers for this that's why we don't want to talk about this which is you know why does it continue to have those genes I'm hoping there's a college student out there or a graduate student out there who's thinking like I want to understand what could be the reason for this because if you can find in my sort of somewhat simplistic way of thinking about problems I think when you look at something in nature and you don't have a clue why it's occurring if you could get a clue why it's occurring you will unlock a whole bunch of other knowledge as well that might not be true but that's like kind of a working hypothesis and in this case think of like you're one of the world's experts on this topic and yet you're acknowledging there are so many fundamental obvious questions like a high school biology student would could ask the questions I'm asking on this topic these are not like super nuanced questions and yet the field doesn't know the answer that's really interesting to be fair there are people who think a lot about this and they have opinions on it but what I'm just simply saying is what is well-established is that mitochondria generate ATP and that generate metabolites for growth and all of this stuff including my signaling hypothesis it's still a work in progress like everything we've talked about just full disclosure to the audience it's a work in progress so if you're a high school student come on and join the party there's a lot to be discovered here well that's the beauty right it's not like we're ever gonna run out of questions that need to be answered

[00:44:31] I think the difficulty in the field historically has been the bias about ATP and thinking about energy and solving that problem and the great biochemist did that they figure out how we make ATP fundamental to life week they figure out how we make the metabolizing TCA cycle but now it's getting much more challenging because those same processes can control gene expression well how does that work I don't know I mean I mean I have some yeah yeah reasonable hypothesis we're testing but I'm very careful as you know to not give a strong opinion on a work in progress so so let's shift gears a little bit to talk about some other broad mitochondrial questions because I do think that people today and maybe it's just the bias I experience because of what I'm looking for so this might not be the case but it seems that the interest in mitochondria has exploded I think people are realizing there's a lot going on here it's more than we realize mitochondrial function is now a term people use all the time but they're not just talk I don't think they're just talking about oxidative phosphorylation

[00:45:38] I think they're talking about broader things and when we talk about aging we talk about something's changing in the mitochondria as we age when you think of hallmarks of aging we can debate the merits of some of them but something's different in the mitochondria of an 80 year old versus an 8 year old what are some of those changes well so this is gonna get contentious now because the data suggests that you have a decrease in mitochondrial DNA some of them mitochondrial DNA has deletions that the capacity to do maximal ATP generation goes down oxidative phosphorylation the key there's maximal so one of the perplexing things and this is really perplexing for me a much more cell so I don't think much about mitochondrial DNA and that's why I didn't have good answers for that but this is the one that really is and this is fundamental to the aging when you're born let's say you have a hundred percent capacity and then as you age that capacity if you're giving a hundred percent mitochondria you get an A+ hundred percent how far do you go as you age just to make sure I understand what you're talking about are you saying amount of ATP generated per mole of oxygen as a metric so that we could use

[00:47:04] ATP generation as a simple okay so it's ability to for every mole of oxygen you generate X mole of ATP and whatever your maximum is it declines and you can burn it through fat glucose carbohydrates protein it's working at its maximal efficiency it's everything's fine and that efficiency now declines with age the question is is it ever rate limiting so you and I I mean again these are loose terms at any given point are using maybe 10 to 20% of our maximal activity hey speak for yourself dude I mean I do wind sprints every day okay so when you when you do that you might go up to 40 or 50 percent I didn't realize that you don't hit that and so when we knock out a protein in the mitochondria and we knock out it completely from 100% to 0% pathology happens we go from a hundred to fifty percent we never see any pathology even under stress even under stress if anything that behaved better so yeah yeah this is very interesting right great and so then when I look at the date on Aging sometimes you know some tissues it goes down by 50% from of maximal maybe 70% 80% but is that ever rate limiting well if what you said make if you what you said is true then it would not be rate limit I don't within a certain cell I am on and this full disclosure again I am in way out in outer space on this idea I don't think mitochondrial function and if you don't have a disease let's be clear normal aging we're talking about right you don't have cardiovascular disease eating you know you're just sort of you're pretty healthy and I don't think a healthy heart you know is rate limited for mitochondria the implication there is that most people think again this is like Dogma like with antioxidants right they're good for you that mitochondria are declining let's give supplements that boost mitochondrial function is that a fair statement heck yeah I think there's no evidence to support that what what is the most popular of said supplements would that might OQ be a popular cell that's an anti mitochondrial targeted antioxidants so we can talk about my tour queue in a second orally actually we should maybe talk about my turkey it's quite fascinating yeah let's go back to your question what what is well no one's actually has you know people have been trying to have these what's called mitochondrial biogenesis activators something that will make more mitochondria and i'm not quite sure what supplement people use that they think is the best one but i would argue the opposite which is that they're not rate limiting and if anything maybe you can decrease mitochondrial function in certain tissues a little bit to activate stress responses which will then fight off if you do get a disease and this cut is gonna go into metformin which I was just yeah yeah how do you read my mind I didn't even start mouthing the word yet why did you know I was gonna bring up metformin because we think metformin is a weak mitochondrial complex one inhibitor yes another which is part of the respiratory chain that's why complex one is my favorite cause why you have complex when it's your face but I'm a poser I'm a mitochondrial poser so okay because what I was gonna actually ask you was on the heels of that when you give metformin you inhibit complex one you are now reducing mitochondrial function right and if what you're saying is correct you would need a lot of metformin to generate actual etc' toxicity right do we ever see that no I mean you do if you go to certain doses it's not physiologically we can't do we owe the anti-diabetic dosing that is given to people I mean there's some toxicity can happen due to certain patient populations and that's but it's a very safe drug right it's used by almost what 300 million people now it's estimate to be used by half a billion people as the diabetes epidemic explodes in China and India so no one quite understands how my

[00:51:14] Foreman works we think it's a you know it it has three effects clearly it lowers glucose production in the liver it has some anti-inflammatory effects and it has some anti-cancer effects well let's talk more specifically about it we were joking around when we were at Easter Island that our next trip actually needs to be to France I do see the goats to see the to see the lilac where from where met wasn't that in

[00:51:37] France where they were that metformin came from so two sentences on how Matt Foreman was discovered they noticed these goats that were eating pretty I love this I love these stories but you know yesterday I was talking to Ted Shafer about goats as well so I loved that the two northwestern guys goats are gonna be these ones so what's interesting about mid form and I think is it got approved as an anti-diabetic drug people went back and looked at people who are taking different diabetes and epidemiologically found that there was a lower rates of like prostate cancer so you're probably talking to Ted

[00:52:18] Shaffer about this right so and they're lower in breast cancer so then people started investigating as an anti-cancer drug then some people started noticing wow it has anti-inflammatory effects and so I've talked to you know friend David Sabatini that isn't it interesting that rapamycin anti-inflammatory somewhat anti-cancer promotes metabolic health so how does that all work well he'll argue it's all mTOR I said well I would argue how can metformin do three very disparate effects anti-diabetic anti-cancer anti inflammatory just like rapamycin would it must be hitting a node that's very important for the cell so metformin doesn't hit mTOR does though ampk does the ampk but that's due to first hitting mitochondrial complex one and then activating ampk which can repress mTOR but the analogy that i'm using basically is m Torinos a master of the universe so as mitochondria right so if you inhibit mitochondria not to the point where you cause toxicity just enough you can activate a variety pathways which couldn't promote have anti-cancer and to diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects metformin somewhat tissue-specific it seems to have a preference for the hepatocyte so it gets into the kidney and the liver i think we've talked about this before about mTOR right so mTOR and rapamycin right why wouldn't you use rapamycin what am i getting everywhere I think

[00:53:48] David's are getting you argued it wouldn't be great if you can get metformin to go to the liver to deliver but not to the skeletal muscle so metformin already has a little bit of that property it only gets selectively into it doesn't get into the heart that well right so it doesn't infect your heart function not directly it affects your liver your kidney it actually accumulates quite a bit in the guts and some people get diarrhea with metformin and so some people think metformin is affecting your microbiome and there's a huge literature now thinking that some of how it's having its effects so I think the liver so I think there's three places that are important the liver and that can account for some of shutting down the glucose production and having the so-called anti-diabetic effect the colon and affecting your microbiome and I think the immune cells I think that's the big one we were missing so that's the one that I'm very fascinated in other words metformin getting into your macrophages or you're probably maybe not your t-cells but at least your some of your immune cells that might be causing high levels of inflammation and you know if you look at the three drugs that people like to use aspirin metformin and statins globally use combined maybe what a billion people probably more probably more the Venn diagram where they all overlap is inflammation so let's talk a little bit about the anti-inflammatory properties of metformin because the the first thing is the one I guess we would understand the most which is you've alluded to this but I just I want to orient the listener a little bit the mitochondria you said are these five complexes each of them have multiple subunits and what happens is these are basically the chains between the inner mitochondrial membrane and the inner part of the mitochondria where these reducing agents like nad NADH and ADP and NADPH are transferring the electrons and building up that gradient so by the time you get to the end of this you've got so much potential energy and all of those electrons and oh you run that transfer of phosphates from ADP to

[00:55:46] ATP and everybody wins the game so this is essential this electron transport chain like messing with that probably not a good idea metformin comes along and it blocks complex one now it doesn't block it completely it blocks it partially now complex one the chemical reaction that's occurring on the inner part of the mitochondrial inner part of the mitochondria is that transfer of NADH to nad now that we're gonna come back to nad but for totally unrelated reasons when you do that what is that telling the cell by inhibiting that the cell's readout is what physiologically three things first that battery that you're talking about that generates to make ATP a less charge less charged so then what happens ATP goes down ATP goes up there's a kindness called ampk kinase ampk is the MP kinase and same PK it gets activated and in part that enzyme is activated is a signal that says I'm not fed enough right right and one of the major things it does is it promotes etaf adji mmm my favorite your favorite right it's one of the dominant things it does that's why when ampk gets activated we get another little benefit Allah rapamycin z' effect on mTOR which is it says hey man I'm telling you from a glycolytic standpoint or from an ox Foss standpoint energy is low shut things down right nutrients are scarce right and this is happening in the liver so for example glucose production that happens in the liver starts to shut down in part or lipogenesis making new lipids in the liver or and that's why like for fatty liver it might have some benefits it's so that's one the other thing is which you Luda to nad to NADH sorry any

[00:57:42] DNA right to making nad so that ratio also gets transmitted back to the cell and what's that cell know how does the low nad to NADH get so the biggest one is lactate to pyruvate mm-hmm right it's a lactate to pyruvate it is a is a source of so there's many ways you can feed pyruvate so we talked about glucose to pyruvate right and so glucose to pyruvate uses any D to NADH and usually pyruvate to lactate will go I'll go ahead and explain what I'm doing so I have to tell you and I think we're both because we're not on camera one of the difficulties of really getting into the nitty-gritty of metabolism is it's so much easier to write it in diagrams right when you write it in the diagram I'm in simplistic ways it's just like it's easier it's just easier right I mean it's just an ABS laughing at me because

[00:58:49] I'm closing my eyes drawing it and as I'm saying it you know any D you know it's the NADH I mean I'm getting confused I promise you this this will be one of those episodes where the the show notes will be handy because we'll have all the diagrams well they can actually you know what they can really do right there's a book I've heard yeah there's a book you you want to give a plug this is a but so for all you metabolite lovers out there

[00:59:16] NAV wrote a book called navigating metabolism wha-wha-wha and I actually picked up a copy as soon as we got back from Easter Island in fact I probably ordered it from the airport in Santa Jaco and it's a fantastic resource and we will absolutely be sure to link to that I would say it is and I'm not just saying this because you're sitting here but if you are a person who's interested in this area but you're not going to devote your life to it it's a fantastic it's the one book you need to get obviously if you're someone who's doing a postdoc in NAB's lab it's something you need to read but it's not going to be sufficient to get you you know to the next level of understanding but for the the knuckle-draggers amongst us you can get pretty far on understanding this stuff through NAB's book and it's actually a pretty quick read it's not you know it's not like reading Striders biochem streetwear that's a very good book by them that was drier was my professor as is the lending group yes so anyway yeah little digression which is to acknowledge this is hard apologies for it but I think this topic is so important and I just know I get asked about this stuff all the time I'm on a personal level professional level so interested in this topic that you just have to pay the price like you have to be willing to get into the details and the reason is we're gonna talk about other things you know people are if I get if I had a dollar for every time

[01:00:37] I've been asked should I be taking you know an hour nmn and should I be going to a clinic where they do IV and AD and all these things if you want to be able to think through those things and read the papers that are asking those questions you have to understand how this stuff works there's no shortcut right so unfortunately we have to continue doing this yeah the way we're doing it and that might mean that I have to close my eyes and pretend I'm drawing a complex one right so I guess we should just talk about any D then write it maybe in any deal you were sort of interrupted you know right so what metformin and doesn't allow is it starts to weakly inhibit complex once so your NADH to nad he is going to be slowed down and and that how that gets transmitted to the rest of the cell is quite it's not fully understood so I have many ideas around this and we can talk about one of them later because it has to do with neo degeneration potentially but the big thing is that any D agent to any D ratio is very important and one of the important things is that when lactate which can come from from like the muscle and the liver takes it up and the lack tape becomes pyruvate and that can then eventually become glucose - that's gluconeogenesis it needs nad but if you have metformin you don't have as much nad so lactate to pyruvate slows down and therefore you don't make as much glucose and that's another reason why metformin has its anti-diabetic properties that just gave me interesting idea we have a friend in common Josh Rabinowitz at Princeton who's a classmate of mine in medical school a colleague really it was really in my table sighing off-the-charts credible guy he had a paper that came out I've talked about it on the podcast very briefly I actually want to interview Josh and I just have to drag my ass down to

[01:02:29] Princeton or he has to drag his up to New York City but this paper in cell metabolism which we'll be sure to link to took orally administered n R or n MN both precursors to nad and it showed that the liver could take those up in significant quantities combine them with tryptophan and make lots of intrahepatic nad but none of it made it into the cell so the NAD doesn't make it into the cell and the N R and the n MN we're not being taken up by cells other than hepatocytes but what you just said made me think of something if the liver in the presence of n R and n MN is making a lot of nad that means it's making lots of substrate to enzymatically force gluconeogenesis or is that never rate limited and this becomes irrelevant the latter what you just said Isis so we're never too low on nad no no no we are we are the maximal amounts and so so there's two things about nad one is just the quantity of nad which then is utilized by search wins

[01:03:35] PARP a variety of other reactions that are important biologically especially the search ones which are nad dependent but that's just simply any D what I'm talking about is the ratio of nad to NADH and so these supplements I don't think they don't drastically change that that redox ratio of any B to NADH it's just the absolute amount of nad which is then utilized is by search ones and PARP and there's something to be said about this because people talk about how nad ratios decline in the mitochondria as we age does that is that rate limiting yeah exactly does it matter if it affects the enzymatic chain a complex one comes back to is a 50 percent decline in nad rate limiting for complex one activity because that would mirror what my

[01:04:28] Foreman is doing that Foreman is lowering the ratio of nad to NADH which would to parallel what we're told happens when we age yeah that's a bit counterintuitive actly bingo so this is my argument most of the people say you got a boost your mitochondria because it's any DS declining the respiratory chain is declining mitochondria rate limiting but how does that jive with this metformin inhibiting complex one theory then if you think that mitochondria an nad and everything around mitochondria is declining you want to boost them if you think they're declining and maybe it's adaptive that's why this decline which is my favorite theory wow that's a little out there that's way out there that this is there's a reason and if you can then give something like metric and it's never rate limiting really at least for normal physiology not maybe for stress and then if you can give something like metformin you can now stress out that mitochondria at times and turn on some adaptive responses so that's a different theory right so the best evidence for it really and is we have to really nail down whether all of these effects of metformin happen by complex one inhibition there's why disagreement in the literature so just to be clear all these roles of metformin for cancer for diabetes for inflammation does it require complex one inhibition so how would you test that well it's hard to have a complex one knockout exists that's incompatible with life so that would be the obvious answer that don't well so I would argue for any drug the best experiment is to make a mutant of that particular complex that doesn't bind metformin bingo yeah so I'm not a good structural biologist but we did something really clever we noticed that the yeast has a protein single protein which will catalyze NADH to nad okay what complex one does and goes exactly it doesn't proton pump which means it doesn't contribute to ATP generation but we have engineered cells and mice to get rid of complex and put back this yeast complex one which is refractory to metformin but ask this question and but the phenotype of that cell is what what is it what is its electron transport chain doing if it's basically losing anything a complex one basically complex 2 through 5 still can't work no no no so what this protein is yeast complex one homolog yeah single

[01:07:11] Pro oh it does everything except the electron transport you know it does the electron transport sorry it doesn't do the proton pump yeah okay got it so you basically reduced your battery charge a little bit but you haven't interrupted the electron transport right oh that's elegant thank you that's a very elegant it's clever yeah this is about the geekiest moment right now is like this is it's one of those things it's clever right right so you put so the first experiment we did is we did the cancer experiment so people had noticed at least in laboratory settings if you give metformin and you can reduce tumor burden in mice you know the classic sort of experiments so what we did is we took those cancer cells and put back the yeast version but

[01:07:58] I want to say something here before you say you tell us what happened which is in fairness yeah and we did a litter of this in 2014 so it's very dated I know what's gonna happen a bunch of people are gonna say Peter can you please link to it it's an internal document I'm a link to it I got to go back and look and see how ridiculous it is but - it's now four years old but it was not clear at the time of this review if the anti-cancer benefits which seemed real were either due to the inhibition of complex one or due to some other mechanism by which an PK was activated and to my knowledge that is still not clear oh it's clear you're gonna sell me it's clear for cancer oh okay keep going so

[01:08:41] I'll tell you the experiment in cancers and then I'll tell you for diabetes does main effect ended I think that's still up in the air okay for inflammation I think there's some strong evidence for complex one as well so the simple experiment we did was we said let's put back in cancer cells that human cancer cells we put it in a mouse and it grows rapidly right you can do it in colon cancer breast cancer lung cancer cells typical cancer biology experiments and we put the yeast complex one in and okay so when the yeast complex one is not there metformin decreases tumor burden if the yeast complex one is there it does metformin can't bind to it so the mitochondria still continues to work and voila the tumors don't go down so what you demonstrated through that experiment assuming we're not being fooled by some other artifact which is always possible is that when you prevent metformin from this one particular issue which is binding to complex one and inhibiting that it's anti-cancer properties cease to exist yeah did you assess the effect in that setting on ampk how much was a mpk act activity up regulated yeah so we don't think the anti-cancer effects are due to be NPK fair but do you have an answer to the question do you know what happened yes so we as they should go down a little bit but not off yeah yeah so we didn't we didn't think about that we looked at other properties like any

[01:10:21] DNA th ratios which we think is the more how much did the NID know so we could show clearly these shut it down yeah yeah with metformin you could decrease it when the yeast complex you can recover that ratio the nad to NADH ratio and all the metabolomics that go with it so when you inhibit complex one by metformin the TCA cycle slows down and you can capture that by mass spec classic what's called metabolomics which is basically looking at metabolite profiling and and what's cool about that is there's a very good scientist give him a shout-out Jason Lucas L at Duke

[01:10:56] University again kind of a younger version of Josh Rabinowitz and what Jason and hooked up with the University of Chicago ovarian cancer very famous ovarian cancer dr. Ernst Lingle and its fellow iris Romero at that point and they were giving metformin to patients and then they gave these biopsies to Jason and

[01:11:18] Jason could detect TCA cycle he could see if met he could ask two questions did the metformin get actually do the tumor yes yeah yes and the second one was if our mechanism of complex one that we showed is correct like then the TCA cycle metabolites should be altered and they wore in those human cancer this is cell metabolism paper you people can link into what your is that that was so we published our metformin paper in Oh 14 I think Jason's paper wasn't oh 16 I think we did the simple elegant experiment which shows the necessity of complex one inhibition but I think Jason did the as close as you can if that mechanism is correct and the humans he did the best the next best thing you could do which is show that TCA cycle so clinically it begs a question is that working because hepatic glucose output is going down and insulin is going down and presumably IGF is going down if insulin is going down IGF bp3 should go up insulin should go down even if there's no change in the amino acids those things should all if you had a little like on/off switch more glucose or less less is better more insulin or less less is better more IGF more or less less for all this for cancer all of those things would move in the right direction if it had a glucose output went down so do we believe that that is the vehicle through which that transduction is becoming clinically relevant right or do we believe that somehow inhibiting complex one in a cancer cell is Dilla tereus to a cancer cell I think both mechanisms ends are working in concert and so clearly metformin as you pointed out lowers glucose insulin IGF and insulin and igf-1 or something that promotes cancer proliferate it seems that about two-thirds of cancer seems sensitive to insulin and ideas and still in play but what we showed is it's equally plausible for cancers that have transporters of metformin and they're called organic cation transporters not every tumor has it and that's why metformin doesn't work clinically as a great anti-cancer agent because lots of tumors just don't have them but if they do have them they'll take them up they'll inhibit complex one and that will have anti-cancer effects right into the cancer cell the reason that's important again is our work genetically ashen when we knock out complex one or three tumors don't grow if we give them it Foreman we can show its anti-cancer effects are due to complex one inhibition so if that's right then could we design complex when inhibitors wait let me ask you a question sorry to interrupt now when you and what you just said a moment ago when you inhibit complex 3 and tumors don't grow that's you have to inhibit complex 3 in a tumor cell or in a hepatocyte introduce my cell and the hepatocytes are normal well the way we these are genetically engineered where the complex threes are one is only lost in the cancer cell so this is the next experiment you have to do you have to be able to separate listen to me telling you the experiment you have to do it's important I think to separate out how much of this is tumor specific versus global metabolic and the reason is the implications are profound not just for other therapeutics but frankly for a more fundamental question was what the hell should people be eating right if if in as much as you believe that nutrition can impact cancer therapy the answer to this question is relevant so we have now generated in unpublished work

[01:15:06] I don't can you talk about unpublished work on the podcast but it doesn't matter so we we've generated a mouse that contains the yeast complex one in the liver ah okay so that this is this is where you'll be able to do the experiment because there's really a two by two that needs to be done here I think they're both working in concert but the major thing isn't then metformin you know may have some anti-cancer effects but what it's led to because of our work and others is the idea that maybe should target mitochondria inhibition for cancer therapy now that's a little counterintuitive yeah so this is again you know I mean I'm sure the audience is like everything this guy says is contrarian so let's just turn them off now but you know our data is very clear mitochondria are necessary mitochondrial function is necessary for tumor Genesis all right so let's take a step back and explain to the listener who hasn't heard what you just said why that is gonna rock some people's world

[01:16:08] I think you've talked about in some other podcasts so there was a observation made in the 1920s by a gentleman named Otto Warburg one of the Giants and trained Hans Krebs for example he won a Nobel Prize in 1931 or 32 basically for discovering the an enzyme for respiration and so he loved measuring respiration and but he did it in cancer he did it in normal cells and he noticed that cancer cells those at least on the bench top not in vivo not in a real tumor not in humans just taking tissues out that they made a lot of lactate it and they didn't consume as much oxygen and this didn't make sense to him because he's like there's plenty of oxygen why should it do that and it led him to think about perhaps that maybe the mitochondria being suppressed in cancer and this led to this long long long dogma that a very elegant simple theory normal cells use a lot of mitochondria and mitochondrial ATP very little glycolysis so in other words very little glucose to lactate a tons of oxygen your heart does it your brain does it but when you become cancerous the mitochondria sort of shuts off and you upregulate tons of lactate and you can see that huge uptake of glucose uptake by fdg-pet that the clinicians do and you can see lots of lactate and that was this theory and then you target glycolysis for cancer or because it'll specifically hit cancer cells because they're so glycolytic and then spared all the other cells like your heart your brain your liver because they're all mitochondrial dependent for energy keep it simple right right so far so good absolutely so and then I mean just a bad to that story about tenure years ago and I've talked about this paper on the podcast but Thompson and metal Matt fatter Han was the lead author but so so Van der heiße Tom lastly on last night in Madison he was here last night night which is in

[01:18:05] Madison oh you know so Matthew and Luke aunt Lee and and Craig Thompson wrote this paper in science almost exactly ten years ago and it proposed a different reason for the observation so it said the observation that Warburg put forth is what you just described but maybe a different reason is that the cancer cell is not optimizing for energetics because that was always viewed as an energetically very inefficient and wasteful thing to do but the argument they put forth was well it's not doing it for energetic reasons it's doing it for growth reasons right it's doing that to get the throughput of building blocks for cells so same observation different explanation the one thing I will say is for whatever reason and including that beautiful review in science which the part that people don't highlight is what is it mitochondria really doing so people sometimes assume oh yeah all that glycolysis and it's for biomass and building blocks oh yeah the mitochondria is as a negligible contribution it's just sort of in the background it's the potato as we call it in the Sabatini world yeah right it's just it's a bi standard and we did a simple genetic experiment said let's just test this so we're gonna take in a mouse with an intact immune system we gave the mouse made it you have for mouse got lung adenocarcinoma lung cancer right the biggest cancer though the most prevalent cancer in the world obviously due to smoking and we genetically knocked out the respiratory chain so can respire so now it's 100% glycolysis it's exactly what a tumor that Warburg would love do you make bigger tumors according to him yes if it's all about glycolysis how do you make smaller tumors wait we made very smaller to him a little little tiny little tumors which told us that mitochondria are necessary our mitochondrial respiration is necessary for tumor Genesis and there

[01:20:00] Haydn's hypothesis would explain that because if you knock out the mitochondria you don't have the biomass right but he didn't say that no no I know I know but I'm extrapolating it's consistent with that ya know Matt and I completely agree it's just the way that review was written ten years ago it was more glycolytic centric so I will give a cheap plug to a review that I wrote with

[01:20:18] Ralph Deborah Dina's - very elegant review 2016 where we updated this is called fundamentals of cancer metabolism and it's really simple it just says if you go back to your biochemistry books and you ask how do you make a nucleotide let's keep that simple you need to make new DNA because cancers proliferate you make one to two daughter cells to four yeah and there you go so where does that nucleotide looks look at the structure it has a ribose US as a backbone that comes from glucose bingo it needs a variety of nitrogen atoms put on it what does that all come from some of it comes from like a spark hit and glutamine what do they all come from they can come out of glucose and there but in Jimmy no acids but their amino acids but they'll come from mitochondria yeah right so in other words they both are one of my favorite word's they're both necessary for tumor Genesis but neither is sufficient oh can we just pause for a moment unnecessary but not sufficient if there's one thing that I loved in medical school when you were doing the basic science classes before you got into the clinic it's that you know when you were doing your physiology classes and your molecular biology and things like that these professors you know they were so great at explaining the importance of very elegant experiments that can demonstrate whether something is necessary but not sufficient sufficient but not necessary neither necessary nor sufficient in all these other things something happens in medical school when you leave the classroom and you start to go into clinical medicine people start to forget that logic I would say the real logic people forget everybody does and we're all guilty of this and this is what you and I've talked extensively about correlation vers causality so you know my daughter can all she wants about how her Papa hasn't taught her any math but her Papa has her one thing correlation first cause allottee but this goes even deeper than that right you got to start there oh yeah fundamentally but I think people

[01:22:20] I mean this is and right now where we even in my world where people see like mitochondrial function go up or down so like take your aging 1:yes mitochondrial function goes down so that's the correlation with aging that doesn't mean bad decrease in mitochondrial function causes aging or drives aging it's just a correlation it could be adaptive or maladaptive that's right I mean that's so that see to me the second-order point is the right point the obvious point is you can't infer causality but the second-order point to that is if there is causality it doesn't tell you if it's adaptive or maladaptive that's that's the nuance and this idea of necessary but not sufficient to me is very important in biology because you can have things that are causal necessary but not sufficient I just taught you exactly causal sufficient but not necessary and most of all causal neither necessary nor sufficient and people love to dismiss those things I'll give you an example smoking and lung cancer there's never been a trial I'm gonna argue smoking is causal with lung cancer just as I'll argue that smoking is causal with cardiovascular disease through different mechanisms endothelial dysfunction in the ladder but no one in their right mind would say that smoking is either necessary nor sufficient lots of smokers don't get lung cancer lots of smokers don't get heart disease lots of people who get heart disease and lung cancer don't smoke so isn't it interesting that you can have something that is neither necessary nor sufficient and yet you can play a causal role in a disease and I again people might be listening going what the hell is he making such a big deal out of this for I make a big deal out of this for because when you get to complex diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis it is very unlikely you will find something that is necessary and sufficient they're very rare to find those exceptions these are such multifaceted diseases and there are so many different ways to skin a cat you know when you talk about cardiovascular disease you've got like four completely different things that have to be going on to cause this disease you have to have lipoproteins trafficking the sterols into the southern material space you have to have the end of the-- you'll dysfunction to enable that to get in there and get retained you have to have the inflammatory response you take one of those things away you change the dynamic of the disease and your other points a great one even if you can infer causality it's not entirely clear what's adaptive and what's maladaptive so our experiments really we would show this mitochondria necessary tumor Genesis so it's interesting that paper you referred to Mandor had and I work graduate students together and postdoc when I was starting my postdoc he was sort of finishing his graduate training with

[01:25:07] Craig Thompson and we were in the same lab and we actually worked together so he's an old friend of mine and obviously Craig's a former mentor and I'd like Luke and Lee a lot for that paper when he came out in 2009 right around at that point when he came out in science we had sent our paper to science and showing that mitochondrion is every tumor

[01:25:26] Genesis they didn't send it out I said oh come on this is know so then we sent it to 11 other journals no editors sent it out cancer cells cell nature and nature of medicine you know nature cell biology general clinical investigator nobody sent it out because the review didn't say mitochondria are not functional it just didn't mention anything about mitochondria it sort of just provided an explanation of the glucose like glucose to lactate why don't to murrs show that and this for the biomass not the energy right that was the point and and it didn't say it was sort of agnostic about mitochondria right and there would be if you go back but people misinterpreted that and saying oh yeah mitochondria are not necessary he's all about glycolysis let's target glycolysis so eventually the paper did get published in PNAS and

[01:26:22] I think that's sort of started I would argue the revolution of looking at mitochondria in cancer other people were doing it as well but but we you know I sort of became a preacher of just pointing it out look if you inhibit the respiratory chain you can decrease tumor Genesis 10 years later to the best of my knowledge and this is really important because it goes back to the clinic as far as I know there are no clinic like drugs in the clinic that are necessarily targeting glycolysis right now there are potentially two drugs that target the mitochondria what do they target specifically so one of them is a complex one inhibitor that the EM folks at MD Anderson have generated and they just published two papers in Nature

[01:27:06] Medicine different from fen Foreman their Fenn form and yeah they're different from metformin for me they're much stronger or they know the binding site by the way they used the same yeast n di one complex one that doesn't bind to metformin but doesn't bind to their drug as well as a to show tested and so how will they prevent toxicity yes yes so now they're doing a trial in AML and so this is a this is a million dollar question and can you find it therapeutic window or where maybe the drug gets taken up preferentially by just because of the properties by leukemic cells or prostate or lung cancer cells but spares the brain the heart and other organs which more you could have toxicity so that's the big issue the good news is if you inhibit complex one it will decrease tumor Genesis the bad news is it might kill you right so so we got to find that window and does it also work well with immunotherapy that's an open question right which is then the new kid on the block like what does it mmm help synergize with the immunotherapy or does it prevent and the immune function so that all of this has to be worked out but my point is that there's some space in this area the other one is a drug by

[01:28:20] Raffaella pharmaceuticals and full disclosure I sit on their scientific advisory board thank you and I'm not pitching anything here's simply in fact like they were already doing this stuff we're just sort of giving him some you know my little biological inside which is I'm trying to provide today but but they've already done a clinical trial and it was and and

[01:28:39] I'll send it to you is published in Lancet Oncology and it was in pancreatic cancer just a safety trial phase one phase one and it targets alpha-keto oh it is a cycle enzymes and so it's it's it's preventing the TCA cycle from functioning to build that biomass and did they generate any data on the tissue specificity of that agent not yet so this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done to try that drug and do the kind of experiments where you can see TCA cycle metabolized changing pre and post drug treatment of a particular tumor and then correlating that with success of remission and you know all the usual parameters now what's interesting about that drug again is why would that be safe any of this the only way these drugs can be safe is they somehow preferentially are getting more into the tumors or they're just so weak that they're not bringing you below the threshold of shutting off the TCA yeah and then maybe they combine well so I can tell you if you give the standard care of therapy cisplatin one of the chemo therapies or targeted therapies like b raf inhibitors there's what happens as you know the the primary tumor sort of deep bulks right it slows down and slowly you get resistance and sending that comes back during that slow resistance phase at that point they're really dependent on mitochondrial function so there might be a window to attack it with like b raf inhibitors or cisplatin and again like everything else they're gonna have to find that sweet spot that's see to me that's where i think this has to go I mean I've always found immunotherapy to be the most elegant of all approaches to cancer I'm highly biased because that's what I studied but ultimately I think the Swiss cheese approach has to be the approach to which is why would we only take one modality of therapy if you are David and you're trying to slay Goliath in the fairy tale one stone to the head does it but in Rio and the real world to take a

[01:30:32] Goliath down I think you need to bang him at the knees and when he bends over and complains about it bang him in the other knee and when he's complaining about that whack him in the hamstring and in other words you've got to be able to do successive blows to a vulnerable cell and that's gonna be yeah when is it most dependent on the mitochondria okay well bang now you hit with that therapy and then all of a sudden to your point earlier maybe at some point you begin to weaken it even you you make it more identifiable from an immune perspective and bang that's when you would hit with the immunotherapy the last point I really like you know would the immune system recognize that tumor better if the mitochondria of that tumor was not working properly yeah see that's I mean

[01:31:13] I may be released that mitochondrial DNA for example as it's dying as long as it were specific right as long as it could it didn't create a diffusive immune reaction but instead a localized allowed the body to say that's not self right that's you know and I haven't I haven't done a podcast yet on immunotherapy I want to have Steve Rosenberg on to talk about yes because I mean who better to talk about this with but anyway so so let's talk about another issue in cancer right which is a I mean I think everybody agrees that most cancers involve somatic mutations you know they're very few cancers that involve germline mutations that's those are the those are the exceptions but the the general one is these are required mutations now some have argued and this is a very minority opinion but some have argued that the somatic mutations of the nuclear genome are actually the result of the mitochondrial dysfunction I think the majority would argue no it's the other way around that the nuclear genomic mutations somatic are actually what leads to ultimately whatever is happening in the mitochondria that may be dysfunctional may be maladaptive may be adaptive you would be in the latter camp correct completely 100% and again this is why this clinical trials are really important this is why the metformin trial is important right so

[01:32:33] I've told you two things I've told you three points and instead of quite contrarian we started with antioxidants that there's no evidence that antioxidants in large-scale the dietary antioxidants just to be clear vitamin E vitamin C have had any benefit to mankind and womankind right there's for human health and disease it just hasn't worked out so either we haven't built the right antioxidants or the theory that Ross and oxidants are bad that theory is off and I would argue that there is off because if anything normally we use a oxidants as a signaling molecules the second thing I told you about is the fact that during aging yeah mitochondria decline but that correlates and it could be adaptive very contrarian point of view if anything if you gave an age and that decreases mitochondrial function like metformin that that could be a good anti-aging therapy right it's not turning on mitochondria but turning off mitochondrion by the way Andy Dylan a good friend of mine I was there with yesterday was done beautiful work on on warms clearly in the warm when you decrease complex one or three you live longer as a warm yeah I don't know Andy but David has spoken so highly of him

[01:33:48] David Sabatini you have as well I need to meet Andy and hopefully interview him at some point and talk about all this stuff of course it could be going back to your point that the inhibition of complex one which inhibits mitochondrial function inside of a non-toxic range might be might not actually be part of will hi my metformin makes you live longer that might just be a it survives despite that not because of that the organism yeah I would argue that you know metformin being anti-inflammatory and I want to come back to inflammatory will come back to that but so the third point is that like pollicis is necessary but so is mitochondria that cancer cells use robust mitochondrial function and and if that function doesn't work the

[01:34:36] TCA cycle the respiratory chain doesn't work or in most cancers you don't get tumors now there are these rare cancers which has a TCA cycle mutation and so this is another sort of logic point right so they look at that rare phenomenon exception to the rule and some people say oh there are these rare cancers that have a TCA cycle mutation

[01:34:58] AHA therefore her cancers have TCA cycle mutations ah come on this is illogical it's the exception to the rule of most cancers at least that we've studied it whether it's in cell culture in mouse models and my good friend Rob Deborah deenus was doing glucose he's doing trace certain experiments like Josh Rabinowitz has done as well they can clearly show the

[01:35:20] TCA cycle it's quite robust and so you know why those cancers can arise is an interesting question but they're the exception to the rule so I'm in that camp well any other I guess ride by the way and then these drugs if they make it in the clinic and really make a difference voila the other thing that I think would favor the genomic argument is a lot of the viral research because when we see viral vectors driving cancer it's it's presumably nuclear DNA not I'm not aware are there viruses that are causing cancer through infecting mitochondrial DNA I don't believe that I think I think it's all nuclear personal so that would be another yeah if anything you know so real cell carcinomas are really so you know these aqua saitama's yep you know what they are benign tumors essentially if you look at in renal cancer and just for the listener to understand meaning they still grow in an in a somewhat unregulated way but they don't have metastatic potential so they're you're not gonna die from these things but they're sort of benign growing tumors yeah even those the major mutation that they have is in the respiratory chain so in other words again they're very rare but but sometimes you do get complex one loss but you know get an aggressive tumor you get this benign tumor at best right so again it's almost a barrier to progression and that's from human genetic data so I'm in the camp but you know ultimately we can do we can do all these cute little mouse experiments and the data is very clear in our hands and

[01:36:49] Ralph's an and Josh's hands and lots of people's and then mitochondria necessary for tumor Genesis TCA cycle activity the ultimate proof is well let's inhibit the TCA cycle for prostate cancer for colon cancer for pancreatic and does it make a difference with immunotherapy or chemotherapy so we'll see and and and by the way the same one goes to metformin and which is that if metformin really does work as potentially as an anti-aging strategy and we can show that those effects are due to complex one inhibition then it's hard to think why that you know that might be this idea that mitochondria rate-limiting or declining to a point during aging that century is that idea can't hold up because you're giving essentially a weak complex one inhibitor to turn on stress responses which means you must have enough mitochondrial activity as you age it's down but not gone right right enough do not be rate limiting and and of course the antioxidant want we've already want that battle right because the trials have all failed and for the person listening to this who's scratching their head and confused and says does this mean I should be taking my vitamin C or my vitamin E or my Whole Foods proprietary antioxidant blend of blueberry skin I think you're right the answer is pretty clear that the harm of taking those things might not be great but the benefit seems to be negligible to nowhere and that's a fair statement are there benefits you think to the natural quantities of antioxidants we consume in our food so for example berries do contain lots of antioxidants people love to talk about those benefits without saying go up and take you know ground berry capsules or something like that do you still think there is a benefit in having in in other words if a berry doesn't give you benefit in the antioxidant there's not a hell of a lot of benefit in it because it's basically just a vehicle to deliver fructose which

[01:38:44] I could argue you don't need any fructose in your life and it's a vehicle to deliver glucose but you can get glucose in better forms or more of it elsewhere so is there some other benefit so I don't know much about berries so the the best one is vitamin C right like how much should you take okay so let's let's talk about an orange is there some benefit in eating an orange yes okay so what's the benefit from an antioxidant and yes so there are enzymes that control DNA methylation and other reactions so simply it to maintain proper function of gene expressions so your genes turn on and off properly a there are enzymes that are dependent on vitamin C and you basically need about an orange a day or a glass of orange juice you know please please please not only juice fine fine but you know but but what I mean is you don't even take ten oranges right eight one an orange a day is enough right that to give you give you enough vitamin C to make those reactions work properly and one or two oranges but you don't need to then go and take 400 has nothing the antioxidant properties of no no no no no no it has nothing to do with Ross and all of this stuff we talked about it has to do with running some enzymes that are important for controlling gene expression I know those genes

[01:40:09] I have to get turn on and off are depending on those uh those and and that so and of course there are some people who might not be taking getting in a vitamin C's and you know due to their diet so that's fine they go they pretty hard to but really hard to do it that means citric acid you know we have it all in a lot of places would you be comfortable speculating that a cancer patient in particular should avoid antioxidants no no I don't think I don't think that died treat you well sorry sorry let me rephrase my question I don't mean through dietary means but through supplemental means like if any patient could actually be harmed by an ansi antioxidant could it be a cancer patient well the one of the trials a lung cancer trial argued that I think was a vitamin E trial and they did worse and in mice you can recapitulate that so why why is that it's not clear so I personally don't take any of these supplements because I think I've got a reasonable diet so just like you so why don't you take metformin I will not take anything unless it's done any drug unless has gone through a rigorous clinical trial that's just my own bias now some people would say ok you're aging now so you're gonna by the time they do a trial you may not be around so what why not take a chance right lots of people argue this about any D boosting pills right it that you should just take any D boost and build by the time people do a clinical trial and all of that it'll take years and years and years and for those people who are already later in life you know go ahead and take metformin and uh so so putting your bias aside because inherent in your bias is an assumption which is the risk of taking it is greater than the benefit of not taking it so either you don't think the benefit is that much or you think the risk is maybe greater than some do and you're certainly somebody who's in a position to evaluate both so tell me where it fails is it a not enough benefit or a too much risk problem probably I'm not convinced about the how much benefit for someone like me who exercises especially right I mean the best effective metformin and it's still--it's anti-diabetic effect and you and I both know you weights you run you're active you sort of mimic the effects of metformin in many ways activates the NPK you get the muscle benefits and so why should I take that now you could say well maybe for as an anti cancer prevention agent maybe the data as an anti-cancer we'll see where that pans out is a large-scale trial that's gonna come out where you're not talking about tame are you know not tame is the anti-aging trial that won't be done for another five years has it be done yeah I think so I think so but if you're healthy and you're active it's hard to see why you would take it now of course you could argue that as you've aged you've gotten some indication that things aren't working as well and therefore you should help take it as a compliment whatever loss you had maybe you're a little diabetic maybe the one place I I'm rethinking about metformin a lot is whether it's so mild anti-inflammatory agent so in other words it sort of keeps inflammation down all the time and whether the effect of that over 20-30 years if you know you are and I are sort of in her 40s and that would have a benefit 20-30 years later what's the mechanism by which that we've I'm glad you brought that up because I forgot to revisit it and and you know one of my favorite trials is the cantos trial where they basically targeted il-1 beta of a pro-inflammatory agent directly and it didn't change the lipid profile but it reduced cars are you telling exactly which tells you that inflammation is oh yeah and there's going to be another trial announced very soon that I think will show similar results using low dose and methotrexate of course I could be proved wrong and maybe that's not I don't know what the trials going to show but that's the hypothesis let's take as a fact just for the sake of time that lowering inflammation has wonderful benefits what's the mechanism by which metformin will reduce inflammation so we think that reactive oxygen species is the free radicals can serve as signaling molecules to activate cytokines and metformin by inhibiting the respiratory chain which is a major side of those reactive oxygen species decreases REO of oxygen species and decreases cytokine and production and again a little bit right it's not it's a weak inhibit of the respiratory change so if you knock out the respiratory chain completely you can never turn on the Seidel you get a bigger problem you got a bigger problem you get a bacterial infection etc so this is just again dampening it enough that if you get an infection you can still respond but just keeping the setpoint where you're at a little bit lower and whether that has good effects over thirty years twenty years of keeping inflammation down and then you know there may be some benefit to that so then one other place you might want to do it is if you live in Beijing or in

[01:45:17] Delhi because pollution increases inflammation that's well known it increases il-6 right so in those sort of places taking something that might decrease inflammation might might be helpful and how robust are the data on the immune modulating or inflammatory modulating benefits of metformin is that relatively but it's not as strong as the other stuff we've talked about is in though no I think I think it's not that many there's not that many papers on it it's you know to be determined but it's something that we're thinking a lot about as a mechanism of why it might have anti-aging properties well look speaking of anti-aging let's go back to nad because we sort of skirted around a little bit obviously one of the most popular types of supplements being offered on the market today and there are several of them are supplements that are aimed at delivering precursors to nad production so again the logic here is it's generally well regarded that cells can't take up free nad they have to make their own nad Josh and

[01:46:24] Rabinowitz and colleagues actually published a paper in June of this year that demonstrated that the nad must be made in the cytoplasm not in the mitochondria and it's actually transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria and thus these supplements mainly went to the liver first well even before that but just to explain the logic the logic is you can make nad from n R or n MN an NR n MN existed in equilibrium if I'm not mistaken the de novo pathway which is from tryptophan that's right as well so by giving these precursors the cells can take those up and presumably make nad there and get more of that nad into the mitochondria where presumably it I think the main argument if I'm not mistaken is actually not around the etc' the oven transport chain but more around having them as cofactors for the sirtuins because the sirtuins of course played these two roles of Isetta lating deacetylated as gene regulators they're basically turning on and off genes so i think the thinking is and again i don't want to be kind of turn this is not my area of expertise but more nad should be a important cofactor force or two ins which are a nad dependent histone deacetylases h DX is that that I can explain yeah okay I mean that's the simplest hypothesis nad levels decline in aging you lose so joint activity declines which is not good right because you now lose the ability to control easy to control gene expression either honestly you boost the nad as it's declining and uh you get a little bit increase in search of an activity right right which so totally makes sense consider is a great experiment you basically asked when you take these supplements where do they go and a lot of it goes to the liver eventually it makes its way into other tissues because there was a simple idea like it's gonna get into the brain easily it's gonna go to your heart it's gonna go everywhere and it's gonna do exactly what you said and therefore have all these magical properties I think the place where any D supplements and met form and start to cross talk is two places the first is it goes to the liver so it might be having some metabolically healthy effects on the liver like metformin and similar to like what metformin does potentially it's a hypothesis by the way the second one is

[01:48:41] I think it gets into immune cells you think that n are let's just make it simple and talk about NR because that's the preparation that's more commercially available you think that NR is being taken up by immune cells potentially but wouldn't Josh's paper contradict that I don't remember if they looked at all the immune cells well I don't think they did but it isn't isn't the takeaway from

[01:48:58] Josh's paper that the first pass effect is so significant that all of the NR was getting taken up by the liver you know it still circulates in the blood right and and your immune cells are in the blood so I I don't know and by though in Josh's paper he also said that the liver once it makes a downstream products of in our it distributes it back into circulation to the right dish a liver remind me was a delivering nad no no I was delivering what downstream product I think was ma'am okay yeah I don't remember and can ma'am be taken up by the other cells yeah and ten am be worketh cannon am work its way back I don't I don't know put on the spot pathways but but I think the more simpler point is is which what

[01:49:44] I think Josh's papers getting in and what you're getting at is really this stuff gets everywhere in has magical properties is then he starts to argue well it goes into the liver or only to certain tissues is then I'm just arguing that a tissue of you can call it's not really but a compartment that we don't think about enough of whether it's with metformin or any D supplements air than flama tree cells so what would an inflammatory cell how would it benefit from having more nad well I mean again for the same reasons right the same reason yeah yeah or or some other nad dependent process that in an immune cell that might be important and by the way there is an enzyme that gets rid of nad you as an nad ace basically cd38 it's most abundant on immune cells yeah yeah so there's an immune connection that is realize there was much cd38 off immune cells I mean depends yeah yeah no

[01:50:36] I mean there I'm not disagreeing with you yeah didn't know yeah this is a little bit out of my wheelhouse but I'm just speculating that there might be a connection between these supplements as basically working as mild anti-inflammatory agents now of course the other way that these things are typically delivered is through intravenous nad which says hey you don't need to make it we'll give it to you we know you can't take nad orally so you have to do it intravenously there I think it went everywhere in that paper right but does it get into the cells yes they're a cell but can take up nad I don't think so but again I haven't I don't remember Josh you should add this is this ask for the next podcast Allah

[01:51:16] I've you know we have stayed away from Judy a biologies it's been quite a contentious field there's a as you know Josh and others are not doing really nice experiments we've avoided nad it would we haven't avoided is nad to NADH ratio right because that's linked to complex wonderful that's what my dad and nad to NADH ratio to the best of my knowledge isn't controlling sir joins or we don't have great evidence for that any D itself might be but what any deed and NADH ratio is doing biologically or how does a cell process that ratio is right now probably the thing that keeps me up at night the most in my favorite new theory of life as we know it which is tied to that ratio now speaking of supplements you alluded to one earlier I alluded to it called my toe Q I'm getting a lot of questions from patients about this should I be taking this should I be taking this should I be taking this can you tell us what it is it's basically coke you let's go q10 but people take lots of cocaine what differs what is my toke you differ from the regular coke you time it has a cation attached to it it and because mitochondria pumping those hydrogen ions they're quite negative in charge like a battery positive and so it will take a molecule that is very positively charged so you so by putting a cation on it which is positively charged you increase its affinity for the cell is that it do the mitochondria into the medical right the problem is that therapeutic window is very tight on that because when we give my to Q we can shut off a lot of

[01:52:57] Ross production and all those beneficial stuff gone so you put on stem cell stem cells don't renew you put it yeah you put on immune cells as they don't get activated and so I think again antioxidants get tough because they have normal biological roles and is kokyu considered an antioxidant coenzyme q the reduce form of it is which is ubiquinol yeah yes and do you think so therefore but they're hard by the way they do you know this super super hydrophobic right yeah their most most available preparations don't even seem to have any bioavailability they don't you can take a ton of them and you can't measure it in the blood but there are potent ones that make their way into the blood and you can measure those levels I think the question is is there benefit in that and I again your view is no my view would be no and your view is it could be harmful I think a lot of these antioxidants have poor availability so so when you know in the Peter attea 2x2 is on the x-axis you think about harm and on the y-axis you think about benefit so but to simplify even though these are continuous variables you you go with two categories so on the x axis which is harm you think about picking something up in front of a tricycle versus picking something up in front of a train obviously one has much dire much more dire consequences and then in the benefit it's picking up you know a

[01:54:22] Bitcoin versus a quarter and so do you view most of these antioxidants Co Q 10 might OQ as picking up quarters in front of tricycles where the upside if they work is probably not that big but the downside is also probably not that big yeah and do you put it on metformin in that category or do you think metformin has more potential much more potential but you still don't take it I still don't thank you so you think my Foreman is potentially picking up a Bitcoin in front of a train maybe time will tell time will tell I mean you know people are now doing clinical trials with med form for anti-cancer I mean that I mean clearly it's still one of the first-line anti-diabetic drugs and people are now running them through inflammation models we've done some interesting work around pollution and metformin which I cannot comment on so there's a lot of interest beyond the anti-diabetic effects of metformin and we'll see how it plays out from our point of view we want to really nail down is it by inhibiting mitochondrial complex one yeah that's that's super elegant stuff so you got it you got to go back and do the experiment we talked about we're making you know we made mice and all of this so we're doing that just to finish you know time is probably we've probably gone over as always but so in my world those ross from mitochondria are beneficial and you don't you know there's no i'm not sure if there's a window we're antioxidants get in to really scavenge them so they're I don't consider them harmful Peter right for that reason so generally Roth's are good again very contrarian but this is where the data is taking us so when is metabolism bad so my favorite new theory which is what I'm really excited about and I'm hoping somebody will give me lots and lots of money to test this because it's a way out there so if you think back about what causes pathologies like Nero degeneration even diabetes the big idea for twenty years has been that proteins get misfolding or they aggregate the idea of what's called proteotoxic city let's clean up bad proteins so now they've done some trials and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's isn't quite worked out but you know again maybe they come too late yeah that that's my argument yeah yeah so I don't have a problem with the theory I think it's a nice theory I still think you know probably toxicity is a real phenomena of causes diseases all that good stuff but what if which is not a mutually exclusive idea what if there's metabolites toxicity what does that mean that means that certain metabolites that are normally found and at low levels and they do normal functions if they rise they can incorporate ology so what's the evidence for that well this is where inborn errors of metabolism come in so they're unfortunately people have genetic mutations in metabolic genes and and those pathways get altered and some metabolites increases or decreases is and that's causes major pathology so we know that metabolites are at a certain threshold are sufficient to cause pathology based on inborn errors of metabolism and so why couldn't it be that in Alzheimer's we have a particular metabolites or metabolites that increase due to the Tau and all the amyloid plaques that people talk about and those then are causing the or degeneration again not mutually exclusive not mutually exclusive it's just a different way of thinking about it so one way you test it is you know someone's got to give me money to do this but you start screening metabolites and in my and rats and people and see if you see signatures and if you see certain signatures and you say so I have one right now that I'm very interested in it's called l2 hydroxy butyrate l2 AG and I know that if a human has a mutation in a pathway they can't get rid of l2 AG and it starts to accumulate they get in big in your pathology so could l2 8gb elevate in Parkinson's and

[01:58:22] Alzheimer's what's so cool about l2 AG and this is gonna wrap everything up from the start is if mitochondria are not working are not functional the respiratory chain is not working then ne D goes down and ne D H goes up and it will trigger l2 AG that's the key trigger when NADH goes up and ne D goes down l2 AG gets made so is this why you don't take metformin no because metformin is a weak this ratio has to change a lot this ratio has to change a lot so for example their physiologic conditions under which that ratio changes that hypoxia and under high pox has been shown that l2 AG levels actually increase and they can then function as a signaling molecule so here's more where the organelle mitochondria is completely dysfunctional so complex one loss has been correlated with Parkinson's dopaminergic neurons are not functioning and so is l2 AG elevated there so have you looked at you know the other patient population you should study this and would be patients who undergo circulatory arrest in cardiac bypass so you're gonna see or even frankly just bypass they're so hypoxic yeah yeah it'd be interesting to see you know quote unquote this idea of pump head can it be explained through any of this stuff well so one other thing and I like about this is is that's an acute event I think we don't see it acutely so you didn't have a complex one and the NADH goes up anybody goes down and a real severe inhibition it takes a long time for that to accumulate how long in cell culture with complex one not 24 hours a couple of days and and you know so you could imagine let's just play fantasy here you get loss of complex one slowly in a dope energic neuron which causes results in

[02:00:19] Parkinson's and then slowly over years you get this accumulation of this particular metabolite and that could then cause the pathology again I'm very interested in just testing the broad idea that metabolites can cause pathologies you know like metabolites toxicity like kind of like Portillo toxicity probably wrong but at least its original well I mean it's just I guess what the the thing that would concern me is the ubiquity of the potential signaling molecules and trying to identify like what the patterns are can that's a I mean look there are no problems worth solving that are easy so but boy you have so many variables in so many directions you don't just have the number of metabolomics you have the time series in which they occur relative to an insult and then the amount of exposure of each that's necessary to drive the disease it could be so easy to miss something with all of those variables right absolutely and that's why we're being very biased and going after this one you know keep it simple test that one but of course we could totally miss it because there could be five other metabolites that might go up that might be causing the pathology and in synchrony right but at least this one is tied to mitochondrial function and so in mitochondria are really dysfunctional well so we started with the powerhouse as people would say well mitochondrial dysfunction ATP goes down okay I would say mitochondrial dysfunction guess what l2 AG goes up this two hydroxy butyrate so interesting it so it's a new way to think about my toe dysfunction that I'm very interested in pursuing so last thing I just wrote down when we were talking earlier I want to come back to it is talk to me a little bit about cortisol and your views on it how does cortisol interact with the mitochondria yeah well we I don't know I see another one that I would love to work on so it's just a weird observation I don't know if you have this I mean I think maybe in our circles we have a lot of kind of type-a personalities who exercise vigorously they wash their diet they do all this sort of stuff I don't know anybody that does that no you don't know anybody no one but I always wonder if they're stressing themselves out by being so careful about everything you know and you know me I am the opposite ie you've seen me eat and drink yeah but you're pretty fastidious with your exercise you're a soccer and I do and I don't overeat and I do time feedings right I still fast 12 to 15 hours most days closer to 15 hours it's no I do watch what I mean but what I'm saying is

[02:02:59] I know people who get very very regimented about these things things and it's like the marathon runners who you know the old line that they die yeah I was yeah that was the friend last night and he was joking about this exact concept then he was talking about his he's an orthopedic surgeon he was talking about his partner or somebody knows and he was like the guy is so into yoga but it's become he's like the way he described it was really funny he's like he's stuck in traffic and he's like

[02:03:28] I got to get to my yoga class it's like yeah of course there's the irony to that right so you know your insulin levels might be fine and everything's fine but you know what's your cortisol levels so I am fascinated by cortisol in fact I'm fascinated by I would love for you to basically develop it it's very simple test that you can sell at Walgreens where you take a prick of blood and you can do it as often as you want and you tell me my thyroid it hormones you tell me my insulin my glucagon my estrogen my testosterone my dopamine serotonin and obviously cortisol write these five or six seven things that I just said because it's about a lot of biology physiology we're not gonna be able to get it that way because cortisol is mostly bound to albumin and cortisol binding protein so it's the free cortisol that exerts his metabolic effects and it's physiologic effects and most of it's not free so you can only measure the free cortisol in saliva and urine and then the other you know you know what I'm saying like like

[02:04:29] I would love to have those Moto's because those hormones I had my disposal and is my testosterone too low - hi this - hi insulin you know I mean just having that data points all the time and then you could sort of modify your diet and your exercise but I think the cortisol one is I pay more attention today to stress as than anything else

[02:04:54] I'll be honest with you I mean I still exercise and I watch what I eat those things seem intuitive because I've done it for so long but I've been wondering if myself and many of my colleagues especially because we fly give talks you have grand pressures teenager daughter she's lovely lots of different pressures we all have right and if that somehow is being manifested metabolically through cortisol to the mitochondria just like we think about insulin right so that's all that's the only reason I want to talk about cortisol no I think I agree with that wholeheartedly I think certainly in the last three years as I dug my heels into it I think hypercortisolism and I and I think I wish people would think of these hormones through more broad endocrine illogic terms you know it's it's very easy for people to think of hypo and hyper thyroidism we accept those as states you can be you thyroid or you can have too much or you have too little and yet people have such a hard time thinking of insulin in those terms you can have too much you can have too little there's a range in which this hormone makes sense and cortisol is probably equally important if not more important in terms of the damage that can be done especially from too much with respect to everything from blood pressure which would then impact the endothelium what it does in terms of inhibiting melatonin secretion in the brain and melatonin obviously plays an immediate role in terms of sleep but also plays an indirect role in terms of neuro regeneration so and that says nothing about what we just talked about which was the role that cortisol may even play in the mitochondria which I'm just learning about you know literally in the past couple of months so I don't disagree I think the challenge in many ways for anyone listening to this if we're gonna be brutally honest I think for many people it's easier to control what they eat how they exercise and exert discipline around taking medications taking supplements but in many ways one of the hardest things to control is our response to stress and I think that's an important distinction to make

[02:06:53] I don't think there's anything that's particularly troubling with being in stressful situations I think the difference is less about the situation you're in and more about the response you have to it and that's probably where the greatest difference is live between people is there are some people who can be in relatively low stress situations and yet they're sort of they're not reacting well to it they're not coping with it well and there are others who can be men different set points where they begin from maybe I mean I guess I just don't understand enough of this stuff I mean I I think but it's I don't you know I don't hear too many people talk about it I don't know I think it's

[02:07:30] I think you know people talk about stress but but sort of like we talked about insulin all the time and glucose levels and for men to stop means you mean sort of in longevity circle yeah and longevity circles like you know it's that a variable we're missing you know no I agree so you're you know what it is in cortisol well part of it is we don't have a target for it right we no one's thinking about pharmacologic ways to manipulate this and we don't have great obvious ways to curb our behaviors like meditation probably is the single most valuable thing I've ever found to help regulate this but you also don't have the ability to measure cortisol levels that easily every time you want to do one of these tests it's you know you're collecting urine over the course of a day and doing a bunch of other things so it's it's just it's involved you don't have the glass of wine yeah you know it's really funny I mean I think there was a paper that came out probably about three months ago that looked at it basically the punchline of the paper was look at any loose alcohol is toxic you know if you look at those events is like 950 950 for the point of it is there's no dose of ethanol where the ethanol becomes valuable but the toxicity takes a while to kick in so you know for some people a glass a day seems perfectly reasonable there's no toxicity but the flip side of it is and this is where I kind of try to have this discussion with every patient is look I'm not gonna tell somebody not to drink I mean I'm not gonna tell myself not to drink I probably have four drinks a week and you know I pick and choose my shots you know

[02:08:57] I have this rule called don't drink on airplanes because the alcohol an airplane sucks so I'm not drinking alcohol just for the sake of drinking alcohol but if you're sitting there and the alcohol is really great it's something you really the the downside of the ethanol the hepatic toxicity of the ethanol can be offset by the emotional benefit that could come from the enjoyment of having that glass of wine with your buddy that brings me to another one of those things we should always measure alt you know the liver how's your alt this morning by the way it's pretty good yeah I would checked it and so I think we're almost at the end yeah this so I have I have one question for you oh they were sort of wrap it up wait I didn't think that was part of the rule well it is because I'll tell you why so when I interact outside of the scientific circles if I'm at a dinner party if I'm at a bar if I'm on a airplane and whoever I'm engaging with they ask me like what do you do now if I say I'm technically my titles professor of medicine in cell biology if you say that they think oh you teach something and why do indirectly but what we do is research so if I just say I do research or if I say I'm a scientist they go oh well that's nice but minute I say I'm a metabolism scientist and I it's like oh like they're like they light up and they want the next question which is what should I eat you got it but wait can I ask you a question now given that you know that that's going to happen when you go to parties do you go out of your way to make sure that you don't prime people for that question or do you enjoy being asked that question I think I enjoyed being asked that question initially as a way to tell people look science is cool metabolism is cool you know I mean sort of not thing there's this image that people have about scientists as you can see here I'm pretty flammable and so I figure you know something that they can relate to as a common language but now I read it because all I hear about is what should i eat what should I eat oh yeah so here let me give you a piece of advice on this note so first of all I have the same problem whenever I'm in a situation to be a wedding to be a funeral could be a party doesn't matter so I've learned that there are two I have to go to things that I tell people I do for a living and I know enough about each of them that I can almost never get called out and the good news is both of these generate almost no follow-up questions now the difference is you're an extrovert and I'm an introvert so you at a party would like to talk to people I on the other hand don't I don't like to go to parties but if I'm dressed you know I don't I don't want to be at parties I don't want to be at happy hours I don't want to be around anybody except two of my friends at a time sort of thing so I just tell people I shouldn't admit this now because now if somebody hears this though no my trick all right I'm not gonna say oh I'm not gonna say you're gonna leave him hanging

[02:12:06] I really make it but I have two awesome alter egos that whenever I met and I in fact I busted one out last night I was at a dinner thing last night I didn't know people and there are a lot of doctors there and there is a lot of butt-sniffing which always happens at doctor parties where everybody wants to sniffing everybody else's but you know it's like kind of the dogs you know walking around sniffing each others butts and there was a lot of what do you do oh I'm the chairman of this and I'm the chairman of that and I I am the head of this fo on then they looked at me what do you do and I just said I'm uh and I said it and it was amazing the crickets are chirping everybody is like they don't know what to say and they said collectively nothing and then the discussion just went elsewhere and it was awesome I didn't have to talk about it right so so I do give an answer and and I want you to tell me if this is a right answer the wrong answer

[02:13:00] I still like and I know it got debunked a little bit I still like the Mediterranean diet yeah I mean not I mean with curry okay hey but generally that kind of died with nuts and avocados when you say debunked I mean I'm not even sure I would agree on anything it has what you're referring to as the Preta med study which I'm guessing many people listening to this one know what that is but in case somebody's not will certainly link to it but this was a study that randomized something the neighborhood of 7,500 patients although we'll come back to randomization I'll put a little asterisk beside that into three groups so at 25 our patients per group and they were randomized in a one to one to one fashion between a Mediterranean diet that was high in extra-virgin olive oil a Mediterranean diet that was high in nuts and a low fat diet and this was a primary prevention study which makes it a very difficult study to do especially with nutritional therapeutics and the study was stopped early was stopped there about four point seven years if my memory serves correctly because the both

[02:13:59] Mediterranean arms were outperforming the low-fat arm now I used to view that as one of the more interesting studies ever done in nutrition because nutrition studies generally suck it did have one major criticism that didn't get any attention at the time of the initial publication which I think was 2014 maybe and that was the performance bias so the groups that were getting olive oil and nuts had those products sent to them the low-fat group to my knowledge did not receive anything didn't get food given to them well that creates the potential for a difference in behavior and that's problematic that's very problematic in clinical trials where you can't blind anyone but the more recent issue the one that I think you're referring to is some irregularities popped up in their randomization so some people doing post-hoc analyses found hey these numbers don't make sense it's very improbable that these people were all randomly assigned and I believe because it's been awhile since I read the correction that what they identified was that a number those patients were not randomized correctly for example and it wasn't nefarious but it was done through convenience so if you had a husband-wife team in the study they were immediately put on the same diet which by the way is logical that's actually a better study design but you have to then change the two statistics to accommodate for that because you have no longer randomized each of those individuals they would be considered one randomization not two to the best of my knowledge even when you take into account those changes or those inconsistencies or those methodologic

[02:15:34] I don't believe it changed the results or the outcome of predamond so we're still back to the initial limitation of were those represents of diets and were those subjects the victim for lack of a better word but the victims of a performance bias so all that said look I think the Mediterranean diet which is unfortunately not a very descriptive term because what the hell is a Mediterranean diet is that what people eat in Italy Egypt Greece Spain like I mean so so I guess the only opposition I would take to the concept is I don't I'd like to be more specific in my description of the diet what I dislike is high protein or a high carb or a high fat diet but people love so the high protein people like guys I want to look like a South Beach model essentially it's for a world as far as I can tell because you can lose weight you know the high carb we know you've talked about it all the time why that's bad and you know sort of the ketogenic diet I mean it has some benefits maybe for the brain and other systems but you know it does make you instantly resistant I mean that there's data in mice well I would take issue with those data though right so so are there data that ketogenic diet make mice insulin resistant I don't think there's hundreds of studies in mice that people have done and so my favorite one I think you should I sent it to you where they looked at a whole bunch of diets and essentially the best one was sort of a 1/3 1/3 like 20% protein because we can both agree if there's too much protein your mTOR might be quite active you need enough for your muscles but this is again not in the elderly so again not with the disease this is just primary prevention that we're talking about in healthy sort of 40-somethings let's start with so it was relatively not high in protein and it was had about 40 50 percent carbs almost

[02:17:23] I think this isn't my study and then the rest was sort of the good fat you know avocados nuts and stuff like that and so I sort of liked that diet because it was a pretty good studying cell metabolism published on these mice and and to me and Toyota bleah some of this mix makes sense and so you know keeping protein not too high because you want to keep them is that the paper that Simpson was the last author on yeah Stephen Simpson

[02:17:48] I think maybe there was like he's Australia yes yes there was 25 again I don't think there's a clear answer to this but you know rather than answer the question let me tell you my two cents on this topic one I don't have a lot of interest in Mouse studies for human nutrition I struggle with them because I think there are so many other issues going on then it's very hard to make that as a fair point the second thing is I always want to be sure that I'm distinguishing between short-term insulin resistance and long-term insulin resistance so I think you're right in the short run ketogenic diets in a non-trivial subset of people generate profound insulin resistance in the muscle again I don't even know what insulin resistant means if we're gonna be truthful like if we're gonna put me in the confession booth I don't have a goddamn clue what that term even means it's so ubiquitous does it mean the failure of one type of cell but not another type of cell to respond to insulin signaling I mean all of these things but I think I know what you mean you couldn't see huge elevations in glucose and insulin and basically a complete refusal of the muscle to accept glucose in someone on a ketogenic diet when they first encounter a carbohydrate but I think it's generally also regarded that after about three days of carbohydrate refeeding that effect goes away and that that effect is sort of a physiologic response to an individual who's been so carbohydrate deprived that their muscles are basically saying any glucose in the system we're going to preferentially save for the brain since we now have all the fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate in the world we need as metabolic substrate so the short answer is I don't know I'm these days I find myself far more interested in fixating less on the exact amount of this micronutrient or my brother this micronewton or that might give it and more on the complete deprivation of calories for more prolonged periods of time so you know people who are used to following me these days I I'm spending much more time thinking about fasting than I am sort of sticking on one diet and sticking to it yeah so I basically eat a third of my calories from really from fat carbs and protein and then the other thing is just the 15 hour fast every day but if you're getting 1/3 from protein that's probably quite a bit probably I think I don't have to lower them you want to check your yeah check your tor well maybe maybe third is it too much but here's my honestly at the parties tell him you're a math professor they won't ask you any more questions I don't remember any math and we'll leave it at that yeah but hopefully they won't ask you two questions no I'm an extrovert and I like talking about metabolism I just I don't have a good answer on the diet I have lots of answers on mitochondria and all that but then just tell me or tell them you're a mitochondrial expert but don't use the word metabolism that people really look at you like Oh anyways hey ma'am thank you so much for for taking the time to talk about all this stuff I had written down a bunch of things I want to talk about and I think we actually got through like half of them oh okay well but that's the nature of this stuff it's so fun there's so many rabbit holes to go down in particular I really loved the double double-click deep dive on metformin which is something I think a lot about myself hopefully once we have some results and there's more clinical trials
