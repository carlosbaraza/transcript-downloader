## Description

Full title: #46 – Chris Masterjohn, Ph.D.: Navigating the many pathways to health and disease – NAD and sirtuins, methylation, MTHFR and COMT, choline deficiency and NAFLD, TMAO, creatine and more

Original release date: 3/25/19

In this episode, Chris Masterjohn, entrepreneur, independent researcher and doctorate in nutrition, elucidates the latest research on the risk and benefits of NAD supplements, and shares his personal intuition on the topic. We also dive deep into choline deficiency and its role in the rising prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. From there, Chris enlightens us on the importance of methylation, a simple yet profoundly important biochemical process affecting our physical and mental health. He also describes the variations of the genes MTHFR and COMT, enzymes which play important roles in methylation and which have profound impacts on our well-being.

We discuss:
-Chris’s background, falling in love with biochemistry, and decision to pursue research over medicine [7:45];
-Choline: what it is, why it is important, and how a deficiency can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [11:45];
-NAFLD: increasing prevalence and potential causes [25:00];
-TMAO: Should we be worried about the TMAO content in choline and our foods? [39:15];
-Types of fatty acids: How they may predispose us to different types of illnesses [53:30];
-Why don’t we see low VLDL in patients with NAFLD? [59:45];
-Understanding flux, and how machine learning may affect medicine in the near future [1:03:15];
-NAD: How it works, supplements, sirtuins, and the central role of the liver [1:09:30];
-Intravenous NAD [1:33:00];
-Oral NR: Is it the optimal way to get more NAD? [1:38:30];
-What is the possible harm of taking an NAD precursor? [1:47:15];
-The MTHFR gene [1:49:45];
-The methylation pathway [1:58:15];
-The COMT gene [2:04:30];
-Creatine: The uses and benefits and it’s important role in methylation [2:10:15];
-Dietary strategies for MTHFR: choline, creatine, folate and glycine [2:16:45];
-How to mitigate the negative effects of NAD supplements [2:23:45];
-A case study of a person with high homocysteine [2:28:00];
-What is the level of evidence that you need to take an action? [2:32:15];
-Does Chris supplement with NAD precursors? And can it improve symptoms of rosacea? [2:35:45];
-Decision making in the face of inconclusive data, and trying to disentangle the placebo effect [2:39:00];
-What does Chris believe to be true that very few people would agree with him about? [2:43:15];
-How to follow Chris’s work [2:48:45]; and

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Chris Masterjohn:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on several key biochemical pathways and their implications for health, particularly:
- The role of choline in liver health and fatty liver disease prevention
- Methylation pathways and their importance (MTHFR, COMT)
- NAD+ precursors and their effectiveness as supplements
- The interconnection between various nutrients and metabolic processes

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Choline deficiency can lead to fatty liver disease [00:13:00]
- Liver requires ~1200mg choline daily for optimal function [00:23:36]
- MTHFR variants affect methylation capacity across population in quintiles [01:52:33]
- NAD+ metabolism primarily occurs in liver with nicotinamide as transport form [01:17:21]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consume adequate choline through eggs and other sources [00:24:27]
- Consider phosphatidylcholine over other forms [01:43:58]
- Match NR supplementation with methyl donors [02:28:05]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- NR (Nicotinamide Riboside): 150-1000mg daily [02:36:39]
- Creatine: 5g daily [02:24:58]
- Glycine: 3-6g before bed [02:20:25]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
Limited discussion of exercise, mainly in context of:
- Creatine supplementation for strength training [02:18:27]
- Collagen synthesis timing with exercise [02:20:25]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Eggs as primary source of choline (130mg per egg) [00:23:36]
- Bone broth for glycine content [02:20:25]
- Importance of food-based sources over supplements [01:43:58]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Homocysteine as marker of methylation status [01:55:22]
- Liver enzymes (ALT/AST) for NAFLD [01:00:37]
- NAD+/NADH ratio [01:11:31]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Cleveland Clinic TMAO papers [00:12:44]
- Rabinowitz group NAD+ metabolism papers [01:24:16]
- DRI report for niacin (1998) [02:46:25]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The methylation cycle is not just about homocysteine, it's about the whole system working together" [01:54:15]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Relationship between MTHFR status and NAFLD risk
- Long-term effects of NR supplementation
- Optimal timing of choline supplementation
- Impact of different forms of exercise on NAD+ metabolism

The episode provides deep biochemical insights while remaining practical for health optimization. The discussion of methylation and NAD+ metabolism is particularly valuable for understanding how these systems interact.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Chris master John I've known

[00:04:15] Chris for probably about six or seven years he's an incredibly bright guy and we've been going back and forth over the past several months just trying to figure out a date when we could get together and I knew this was going to be an exciting episode I also want to preface this by saying this may rank among one of the more technical episodes that we've done and that's probably saying a lot given our podcast so this is definitely one where the show notes are going to be helpful so Chris earned his PhD about 10 years ago in nutrition science and after a brief stint as an academic he has largely devoted himself to creating just a vast wealth of information for people to help them understand so many aspects of nutrition I have learned so much from

[00:04:55] Chris over the years and I must say I probably learned more on this podcast than I learned on many of the podcasts that I host although I do like to learn something on every podcast and think that I do what do we talk about well we talk about a ton of stuff we kick this episode off by going deep on choline choline deficiency is something that as

[00:05:17] Chris explains predisposes us to a whole bunch of bad stuff not the least of which is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which if you've heard me rant on this before you realize is an enormous epidemic and is in fact on pace to become the leading cause of liver transplant in the United States of course that leads us into a lengthy discussion of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and also a detailed discussion about the different types of fats and how they may predispose us to different types of illnesses we also get into a topic that I get asked about all the time and I have purposely not gone into this in detail because I've known that I want to have Chris on and I want to discuss this with Chris and those are the enzymes MTHFR and comt I get asked tons of questions about these and many of you ask questions about methylation they're great questions and I think it's safe to say virtually every question you have on the topic of MTHFR methylation will be addressed here we save the best for last and again many of you have asked this question Peter what is your view on nicotinamide right beside or nmn or nad sirtuin activators all of these things now we talked about this stuff in pretty good detail with David Sinclair on one of the previous episodes we go a little deeper here and in particular that's because since the episode with David

[00:06:37] Sinclair there has been a little bit more research that's been published and we go really deep on some of those papers so I would say that by the time you're done with this episode you will have as much information as one could say is available on the use of supplemental products that contain n R or n MN so obviously the two of these that are most commercially known are

[00:06:58] Elysium spaces or chroma Dex's true Nyugen again I want to just say this episode is a little more technical than most of our episodes and again I acknowledge the irony of that statement that means it's really technical the show notes will be helpful there may be parts of this that are more interesting to you than others although personally I found every minute of this to be like drinking from a firehose and truly learning this stuff you can certainly find out more about

[00:07:25] Chris and his work on his site which is Chris master John PhD comm and that's basically spelt as you would expect it to be John is Joh and is reactive on social media loves to interact with people so if you haven't heard about Chris prior to this episode I suspect you'll become a fan of his going forward so I hope you'll enjoy my interview with

[00:07:46] Chris master John hey Chris thanks for trekking in man thanks for having me Peter it's good to be here yeah so you said you'd moved you're no longer in Brooklyn right I moved to Astoria so pretty close by yeah it was probably a quicker trek here from a story of in Brooklyn I think yeah it just has less cachet right like Brooklyn is so cool well yeah maybe I would have wanted to spend more time in Brooklyn but like no just geographically Astoria's yeah closer to the river yeah yeah where'd you grow up so I was born in Queens actually I kind of came full circle back but when I was 10 months old my family moved to misty Massachusetts I grew up in a small town that almost no one has ever heard of that wasn't big enough to have its own high school and aggressive so not framing him no no about an hour and a half west of Framingham and no accent yeah you can do it on William just to know just to far away from

[00:08:42] Boston you know so got it and what did you study in college I know you're talk about your PhD cuz it's so interesting but what did you study in college I in my undergrad I studied history okay I focused on completely irrelevant things to medicine nutrition like medieval church history and early American Revolutionary history I originally wanted to be a social studies teacher and so in my in my vision I was majoring in whatever was the most efficient way to get an undergrad that would be relevant to being a social studies teacher I just had such profound experiences with health in my last year or two that I by the time that I was in my last year I completely changed my mind decided I wanted to go to medical school but I had to finish my degree and then in order to go to medical school which I didn't wind up at doing but in order to go to medical school I had to take years worth of undergrad science classes to get the basic prereqs and while I was doing that a combination of my colleagues my teachers me falling in love with biochemistry and molecular biology and all the little invisible things that we couldn't see and also me starting to come up with my own scientific hypotheses that I knew no one would ever research them unless I did all of that just kind of combined to make me decide to go into research instead of instead of medicine so I think what I really wanted to do is take my own experiences and pay them forward in some way and I think the best way that I can do that is by using the creative part of my brain to really immerse myself in the research and come up with new ideas yeah and it's funny you know I think I've said this before maybe on the podcast but if I haven't

[00:10:24] I've know I've said it elsewhere I always think the worst thing you can do is do an undergrad what you're necessarily going to do in graduate school so if you're gonna go to medical school I've never really understood the logic of studying pre-med I mean I understand the logic but I think if you can stomach it it's better to do something completely different and then and similarly when you're doing your PhD

[00:10:46] I mean sometimes you don't have a choice you know if you want to do your PhD in aerospace engineering you have to do something that approximates engineering as an undergrad but yeah your story is pretty interesting in that regard and and I suspect you're in some ways better off for having done something totally different if nothing else it gave you

[00:11:02] I suspect kind of a fresh enthusiasm for what you were studying at school yeah I think for sure and I also think to some degree I actually bring my history mind with me so I think one of the things that we that we often neglect in Sciences we get so caught up in the latest research that we forget to study the foundations of where things came from and so my instinct is always to say well where did this idea come from what was the origin of this and that inevitably leads to finding a fresh way to look at something because you realize that the path that led you there that there were details that got left behind because no one knew what to do with those details at that time but then 70 years later oh now that that little detail that we forgot actually makes sense now and you can start to just get a fresher perspective than you would have if you if you only look at what's been done over the last 10 or 20 years you know when I was thinking about us sitting down together I was having a hard time figuring out where I wanted to start because I also I realize we run the risk of once we start on a topic it's possible we will never get out of said topic but there really are several distinct things I want to get into with you so I actually did something I don't often do which is I made a bunch of notes and and these notes are gonna kind of keep me honest because they're gonna at least remind me of major themes I've used different fonts and highlighted than I've ever really nerd it out on this why don't we start with something that you and I have spoken about probably six seven years ago which is choline and and I think the context in which it came up was when a paper came out of Cleveland Clinic I believe it was

[00:12:44] Stan Hazen's paper that looked at TMAO and it got a ton of attention and the thesis was this TMAO thing is the arch enemy of your arteries and you're gonna get atherosclerosis and diets that are high in choline are predisposing to this and I remember you me Stefan guy in a Chris crecer we taught we were talking a lot about this because certainly at the time something didn't make sense leaf we first encountered each other right yeah

[00:13:11] I don't know if it was the first time but it was certainly early on the first real email discussion that's right yeah we had this huge email thread and I couldn't wrap my mind around how could this be true if the epidemiology which I'm not a fan of epidemiology but in the contrapositive it can be quite helpful which is every epidemiologic assessment of people who consume high amounts of fish would suggest the exact opposite and yet this paper would suggest that there's nothing you could do worse than eating fish outside of choline laced sports drinks so let's go back in time to that whole thing so let's start with what is choline choline you could look at it from a health perspective or a chemical perspective let's go mcclee let's just say yeah what so choline is a methyl donor choline is an essential part of acetylcholine which is a neurotransmitter and choline is an essential part of phosphatidylcholine which is a phospholipid that is in our cell membranes and I'm just going to because I know there's half of our listeners will know exactly what you just said and half of them won't but because we're gonna come back to these terms so often what's methyl what is a methyl group so

[00:14:16] I think the easiest and simplest way to think of a methyl group is is to come back and look at the fact that we are biological organisms all biological organisms are made of hydrocarbons and if you look at any molecule in our body it's mostly a string of carbons and if you want to synthesize one of those molecules or you want to change one of those molecules you're gonna have to put together carbons or take them apart and you can either put together carbons in two carbon units called acetyl groups or you can put together carbons in one carbon units and that one carbon unit is a methyl group and if you just think about it very simply if you had a molecule with an odd number of carbons you'd have to put a methyl group in there sometime because two plus two plus two plus two never makes an odd number or you might have a molecule that has something else in it like a nitrogen and it's got three carbons attached to it well the only way you can do that is methylate that nitrogen three times right so we use the term methylation as a verb to say to put on a methyl group right right and in fact the methylation is also called the 1 carbon metabolism so a methyl group and a 1 carbon is is identical ok so we've got this idea of choline plays an important role in regulating how that whole methylation thing works choline is relatively abundant in certain things that we eat right yeah if you look at the diet you see enormous amounts of choline and liver and egg yolks and then you see moderate amounts of choline and many other foods most of those foods that are pretty good sources of choline but not awesome sources of choline are meats nuts and low carbohydrate low calorie vegetables especially cruciferous vegetables and in fact we did not know for the longest time that choline was an essential nutrient in humans and still they started feeding people on total parenteral nutrition and they weren't putting choline in because I'll explain to folks what that is so total parenteral nutrition or TPN is something that is completely given intravenously but into large central veins and it's for people who have such severe pathology and their gut that nothing that you trickle into their gut could ever give them nutrition and so you're feeding them through these large veins and I guess where you're gonna go with this is when you're feeding someone with total parenteral nutrition you have 100% control over what they're consuming and

[00:16:43] I know where the store is going it's so interesting it can really expose deficiencies that we take for granted the same thing is true of omega-3 fatty acids or a number of nutrients that we just assumed no one needed until we fed them on TPN without that thing and then all of a sudden something really really bad happened so what happened with the choline deficient TPN folks those folks developed fatty liver which is very counterintuitive right in the sense that they probably weren't being mainlined a lot of fat right right but it turns out that because choline is an essential part of the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine and because that phospholipid is not just in our cell membranes but it's also in the membranes of a Leiper proteins that carry fat out of the liver then if you don't have enough choline you can't make the B LDL particle to get triglycerides out of the liver and we think a lot about we want triglycerides out of the blood but we want triglycerides out of the liver too first and foremost right yeah so if choline is not there you get fatty liver that's not surprising hindsight if you just look at the animal research because you go back almost a century and they had basically done the same thing to animals so when they started purifying animal diets it was almost the same story they didn't realize these things were necessary a bunch of problems happened they realized the nutrients that were necessary and going back to the beginning of the 20th century what we have is rodents developing fatty liver on the diets until they were able to either put choline in or reduce the sugar content but in those animal experiments what ultimately was shown was that it doesn't really matter what the cause of the fatty liver is as long as you have enough choline in the diet where you have some precursor to make choline whether it's sugar alcohol fat as long as you have enough choline in the diet you can clear those triglycerides out of the liver so that's interesting and there's something I should want to explore with you because you know I'm in the midst of writing this book which I'm so sick and talking about I'm so sick of talking about the heck that I'm in the middle if I can't wait to just be done with the thing but one of the chapters is on kind of this spectrum of naphthyl

[00:18:52] D Nash insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes so in doing that you know I went back and had to look a lot more at the history of who was the first person to describe it what was that index patient who first had nephal D and it's this sort of funny story of this character who was drinking something to the tune of like 20 bottles of coca-cola a day and he's just mainline and coke this back in the 50s and so you alluded to this a second ago which is you know sucrose plays an important role in this ethanol plays an important role in this so the question is if I understood you correctly is it safe to say that you take a person let's just make it clinical take a person who has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second but with enough choline you don't have to necessarily restrict any of the substrates that are predisposing to more fat accumulating in the liver than exiting the liver that's what I would believe based on all of the animal experiments that were done it baffles me that we don't have human studies addressing exactly that I mean we have human studies that if you put people on a if you take what the person is eating right now and then you put them in a control lab environment and you take the choline out of their diet nine out of ten of them will develop fatty liver disease and by the way does it progress from fatty liver to the Nash variant where you actually start to see the inflammation or is that not necessarily a place that they progress to is it just the accumulation of fat in those stays you're looking at short term development of stay ptosis and which is just the simple fat accumulation based on how I understand the physiology of fatty liver disease what you would expect is that putting a bunch of fat in the liver is kind of like building the kindling for a fire so you build the fire and you don't light it then that person at some point they might not ever light that fire but all it takes after that all that kindling wood is put into place is some hit of inflammation or oxidative stress that suddenly lights that up on fire and in the literature that's called the two-hit hypothesis a fatty liver so what you presume is not that stea ptosis necessarily leads to stay out of habit itis but that you can't develop stay out of hepatitis without stay ptosis right so it just puts you now into this new category where there's a fairly high probability that that will happen but the point I want to make with these acute studies is we know that the average person walking around out there who doesn't have fatty liver they don't have fatty liver because of the choline in their diet not because they're consuming a paucity of the things that are uniquely fattening to the liver the two most obvious being fructose ethanol or highly abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids things like that well it's both but what I'm saying is in these studies that were done I believe this was Stevens Eagles group who's one of the main choline guys they just took people randomly eating whatever they were eating and they didn't have any fat in their liver and then they put them on this experimental diet where they took the choline out of it what they were already eating so they probably reading some sugar they were probably drinking some alcohol I don't know exactly how much but the point is if you're out there walking around without fatty liver and you can see this in the TPN - like those people at some point in their history didn't have they went on the TPN and they got a liver but you don't have to put them on

[00:22:17] TP yet you can just put them on a low choline diet and if you look at all the animal experiments what they show is you can cause fatty liver with sucrose you can cause fatty liver with alcohol you can cause fatty liver with fat and no matter how you cause it you just put in choline or you put in things that can be precursors to choline in any of them at a high enough ratio with the other things that are producing the fat and liver will get rid of the fatty liver so if we know in humans that you get fatty liver when you take the choline down and we know in animals that you get rid of fatty liver if you put the choline up then I would think that if you took the humans with the fatty liver and you put the choline up you get rid of it but for some reason that hasn't been tested the way you'd think it would be do you have a sense of how much choline is required in that situation so if you took a patient who unequivocally had fatty liver disease by say MRI so we take the gold standard and we could actually measure you know they 20% of their liver was now made up of fat and they were on let's say they were not on an especially restrictive diet so they weren't someone who was avoiding eggs or anything like that but presumably they weren't having enough how much choline would you guess you'd have to put in the diet and would you be able to achieve that through eating more foods rich in choline or would you actually need to supplement it

[00:23:36] I can only give you a wild guess and my wild guess would be about 1200 milligrams of choline and you could get that by eating food but it would be very difficult so how many milligrams of choline in an egg 130 you don't know how many eggs are you how many no well I have chicken so I had four this morning yeah yeah I could I could I could easily eat six eggs a day you can do it but it's hard and you'd have to design the diet to do that right I'm basing that on a couple things one is there are human studies where it has been shown that some people require 1200 milligrams of choline a day and those studies are not looking at liver fat they're looking at other markers but people who have a genetic predisposition to need what we know is the highest choline requirement that a human can have is about 1200 milligrams the other way i base that is that it's been shown with labeling studies that in if you take a random sample of people with

[00:24:27] Nash which is the state Oh hepatitis they have inflammation too if you take those people when you look at their triglyceride export it's reduced by 75% so if it's 25% of normal then I look at that and I say well you probably want to quadruple the ability to export triglycerides from the liver and it's my guess that although the adequate intake which is the replacement for an RDA when you don't have enough evidence for choline is higher I think the average choline intake is probably somewhere around 300 milligrams what's the RDA for

[00:24:59] Cowan it depends on men and women I might be wrong on this but I think it's around 500 but it's a little bit higher for men it's a little bit lower for women I don't remember the exact numbers you know the funny thing with with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is it's hard to know the rate at which it is increasing because like many things it was so likely under diagnosed in the book I'm actually writing about sort of the first patient I saw that likely had it and it was you know during a case when I was a resident and we were operating on this guy and prior to surgery I had done all the usual things and tried to figure out how much alcohol he drank which you do with every patient because you need to understand what their requirement for benzodiazepines is gonna be and if they're gonna have withdrawal in the perioperative period in this patient claimed he didn't drink any alcohol and I believed him and then we got in there and operated and his liver looked like a fattened duck liver and I remember thinking I can't believe this guy lied to me but after the fact that you know I went back to him and we

[00:25:57] I said just look I'm not here to judge you you got to tell me how much you drink and he's like doc I don't drink anything and I sort of forgot about the whole thing until 10 years later when I realized oh my god that was nephal dee well what year was that 2001 so in 1980 the Mayo Clinic published a paper in which they coined the term Nash which came before nephal T mhm and they coined it because of that if you read their paper their rationale is we have doctors that are seeing fatty liver they assume that fatty liver happens because of alcohol the patients are telling them they don't drink alcohol and they're saying you're lying to me and the best thing that can come from that is an argument and there could be worse part of it was that it facilitated the growth of a whole of research but the other part of it was it allowed doctors to have a way of thinking and talking about the person who says that they don't drink alcohol and yet they have fatty liver right they have they have a liver that for all intensive purposes looks grossly just like that of someone who is about to kill themselves through a lot of alcohol now Ron Busey teal who certainly one of the preeminent liver transplant surgeons in the world said and this is probably about four years ago you know in the year 2000 something like 1% of liver transplants were being done for naphthyl

[00:27:10] D Nath will be predisposed nobody needs a liver transplant if they have Nath wildy but if you get an Apple D Nash and cirrhosis you do need a transplant and that amounted to 1% and in I think about 2013 2014 he predicted that naphthyl D Nash cirrhosis was going to be the leading cause of liver transplant by the year 2030 in the United States as a result of two things one the sort of undeniable increase we were seeing in

[00:27:38] Nashville D and of course the success of treatment for both hep E and Hep C so it's both those things coming down and the other one going up so my question to you which I apologize for how long winded it is even if we are over diagnosing it today or seeing it more than it was there before it seems hard to deny that naphthyl D is more prevalent now than twenty or thirty years ago would you agree with that yeah

[00:28:01] I think even though you can't track the prevalence over time you can assume that the prevalence has increased over time matched to obesity because that's the overwhelmingly predisposing risk factor so do you believe that it is more driven by a fat accumulation in the liver problem or choline being less prevalent in our diets and therefore more of a clearance problem it's hard to make an either/or question about it because it comes down to fat in versus fat out and choline is such an overwhelming factor in the fat out part of the equation but

[00:28:36] I think the reason that it's increasing over time if you had the data I really doubt that you could show that there's been a linear decrease in choline intake over those years and I think you probably could show that there was a fairly linear increase in natholi over those years that tracked with obesity and I think you know you can look at it like what's the percentage of people with obesity who have fatty liver or what's the percentage of people with fatty liver who have obesity and I might have these numbers backwards but I think it's 67 percent of people who have obesity have fatty liver and 76 percent of people who have fatty liver have obesity something like that and I think the overwhelming reason for that and I don't think it's the only reason but I think the oh the overwhelming reason for that is that the more obese you are the more likely you are to have visceral adiposity and the visceral fat pad directly empties into the portal vein and so is a huge factor in fat in compared to the subcutaneous fat pad and

[00:29:39] I think that that's probably a huge factor in why again not the only factor but I think that's probably a huge factor and why the metabolic health of someone who has relatively more visceral fat is so much worse than the person who has relatively more subcutaneous fat is because you're basically pounding the liver fat all the time you don't even have to eat anything it's just you're always engaging lipolysis you're always freeing some free fatty acids and if you have this gigantic tube going right into the liver just feeding fatty acids in all the time then I think that's the major thing now one of the challenges of studying naphthyl D is and I can say this with some experience because I used to you know be involved in an organization that was funding research in this is removing the biggest confounder of the reduction of methyl D which is weight loss so the biggest challenge is so let's say your hypothesis and I think fructose is overwhelmingly on a molecule for molecule basis probably one of the greatest drivers of naphthyl d when you take fructose out of the diet very often a person is going to lose weight either through some reduction you know spontaneous reduction in intake or some other thing so it's hard to then say well with fructose elimination you're ridding yourself of naphthyl D or dramatically reducing it and how much of that was due to the fructose reduction and how much of that was due to the weight loss are you aware of any data that have done a great job at trying disentangle those two and it doesn't necessarily be fructose but it could be an input issue so ethanol PUFA fructose an output issue choline or the way you describe it is sort of this in-between visceral thing which is visceral fat tends to decrease when adiposity decreases so it's almost like there's a third variable and it is challenging in humans to figure out how to isolate each of those I don't think you can do it in humans well I think you could do it in humans I don't think anyone will do it in humans and I don't think that there's any data out there that do do it in humans and I don't think anyone will ever bother to try to figure that out because what that would require would be putting people in a metabolic Ward and feeding them precisely controlled diets and I think this is a huge point that you're making that applies so much broader than this discussion because whenever people make one change in their diet and that changes changes to the foods in their diet they're actually changing like 30 or 40 things in their diet and they have a high they're driving idea of what they're doing is only one tiny part of what they're doing and so if you look at say taking the fructose out of the diet whole with you know what's the fructose in most cases it's a bunch of junk food what did they eat instead well either they ate nothing instead or they ate something different than that which was probably better so the average person who takes fructose out or who takes carbs out even if you just go on a low-carb diet well your idea is that you reduced your carbs but actually you probably increased your protein you probably increased your choline you probably increased your riboflavin you probably increase the bunt you're probably increased your zinc you probably increased some a bunch of different things and I think that the only way to make sense out of the human data is to take all of the animal data that does have precise controls on it and say you know not assume that the animal data always matches the human data but if you can take all the animal data and you can say wow everything that is in the human data makes perfect sense according to what the theory we get out of the animal data is then that's what you do right so when we're talking about fructose when I was in graduate school I fed rats a 60% fructose diet and I was hoping that they would get fatty live and I was hoping that I would actually what I what I was waiting 60% fructose or sucrose fructose how can they even digest that I mean how did they how do they not just get such severe dumping syndrome with so much fructose they might have had a little bit less digestion because they were a little bit leaner the point is there are studies out there showing a 60% fructose diet causes fatty liver and did you see it in yours no because you had lots of choline do you assume well I wasn't trying to have lots of choline but in my department we never fed rats were mice on casein diets which is what almost every rodent study out there is and my Jason being the dominant protein is melty yeah yeah but every rodent diet is based on casein almost I didn't even know why we did this it was just tradition in our lab and in our whole department that we never used casein and I later I talked to my department head about it and he said well I've seen studies showing that casein is inflammatory in rats and it causes copper deficiency so we just prefer to avoid it so then I look into the amino acid composition of my diet versus the casing diets that everyone else is using and it's something something like six times more methionine which is a choline precursor that has been shown in animals to obliterate fatty liver something like six times more methionine in my diet so all the sudden my my negative finding makes perfect sense with everything else that

[00:34:48] I'm looking at and you know part of the reason that I have a unique perspective on this goes back to what we're talking about at the beginning about getting a historical perspective right I was writing a review on fatty liver with my doctoral adviser and I was obsessive about needing to know the origins of the methionine choline deficient mouse model so I went all the way back to des turn this century and what they found originally was you could produce fatty liver in rodents if you fed them an 80% sucrose diet if the nutrients came from whole foods that they were using before like yeast and Colliver oil and things like that then when they started producing chemically defined diets all the sudden 50% sucrose was causing fatty liver and so then they said oh we need to reduce the sucrose so they reduced it further but then people who took those same high sucrose diets at that time showed that you could add choline you could add methionine which is a choline precursor you could just up the protein if you just up the protein which has

[00:35:53] Metheny which is a calling for cursor right if you provide any of those precursors it just gets rid of the fatty liver so I take those things and I look at the human data and I say well that person reduced the fructose in their diet I believe that's a contributor because fructose compared to starch is more lipo

[00:36:11] Jenna and in fact one of them animal models that you use for fatty liver is called the methane and choline deficient mouse model well it's not just deficient in finding clothes yeah but it's also got yeah it's also got a bunch of sugar in it and it's got a bunch of corn oil in it and they have shown that you can reduce the fatty liver if you replace the sugar with starch so when I look at the human data I'm gonna say I do believe that reducing the fructose is going to reduce the amount of fat that the liver is producing from sugar but I also believe that in that if you did that and you replaced it with protein then that was part of the results or if you replaced it with vegetables or you replaced it with egg yolks those were part of the result right and to your point it's very difficult so when you look at the study that just came out in

[00:37:01] JAMA two weeks ago which which actually was the one that way at the beginning I was involved in the funding of but I had no involvement in the study whatsoever it didn't I mean I had to read about it like everybody else when it came out of JAMA but this is the one that Miriam Voss Emory was the first author on this is the study that took 40 Hispanic boys with biopsy proven nash and for eight weeks put them on a virtually zero fructose diet with no instruction to reduce carbohydrate in fact the idea was replaced fructose with glucose to your point right glucose is not going to produce fatty liver in almost any quantity they saw a 50% reduction on MRI in liver fat but if you want to be technically you know rigorous they lost three pounds on average now I don't know that the three pounds matters that much but I think your broader point is they almost assuredly cleaned up the quality of their diet in ways that's difficult to measure even just looking at the macros because I think it's easy to report the macros in a study like that well carbohydrate content was unchanged you know protein went down a little fat went up a little or vice versa but at the micronutrient level or at the amino acid level I just don't think that stuff's being tracked it would be interesting again I I don't know it might even be worth you contacting

[00:38:16] Miriam Voss who I've met twice and she seems you know very collaborative and interesting and it might be worth understanding what other data they would have with respect to the nutrient because I'd be curious to dig further into this point yeah and if they have food data if they were collecting what are they eating for foods well the food was provided oh I'm sure they could go back if they have what the foods were

[00:38:40] I'm sure they could go back in yeah this was a very well controlled study in that the food was provided not just to the children but to their entire families the idea was make it so easy for the child to be compliant for the eight weeks that they were on this diet that the entire family's gonna get fed the same food yeah so they they have to know what they were providing in order to estimate the macros so they must be able to ask to meet the microbes that would be interesting yeah I'd like to see that because I remember when I read it I was really hoping that the results would come out independent there would be no change in weight that the kids could maintain their body weight and then you could ask the question could this nutritional intervention alterna field the independent of adiposity okay so now let's go back to where we started right so you've made this great case for choline and its importance and

[00:39:26] I've always found the TPN and stuff to be one of the most compelling reasons because you just don't get you don't often get in life a chance to create a truly deficient model in humans so now let's talk about this thing called TMAO what is it and how did it rear its head into this discussion and all of a sudden choline became public enemy number one before these studies came out from the

[00:39:48] Cleveland Clinic TMAO is mostly known in being found naturally in fish and in being produced in the gut in very rare cases where there were people with genetic disorders and I don't even remember my head with those genetic disorders were but they were feeding them absolutely massive amounts of choline and so was known before that that in those cases of enormous choline loading some of that choline would be converted to trimethylamine by gut bacteria and that that trimethylamine and actually the the interest was largely in the trimethylamine because the trimethylamine is the more smelly compound so this would produce fish odor syndrome these people are smelling like fish so that was what was known about it at that point but then in 2011 I think was the first paper the Cleveland Clinic came out with experiments I think in first and mouse but also in humans showing well showing different things so in mice that were genetically engineered to have defects in their lipoprotein metabolism they showed that TMAO was directly atherogenic and in humans they showed that in there were two different papers the first one looked at choline and the second one looked at meat but what they were showing was that TMAO levels in humans corley with heart disease risk and when humans eat either choline or carnitine they will metabolize both of those two trimethylamine in the gut and the liver will convert it to TMAO and so the argument is the TMAO and those humans will cause heart disease the way that it causes heart disease in the genetically engineered mice and if I recall there were basically three ways that they were suggesting you could get too much of it one was too much fish if you eat fish you're getting the TMI don't they mention fish maybe I'm confusing it with a different paper but I thought one argument was too much fish is too much

[00:41:49] TMAO too much carnitine which is found in sports drinks is going to be converted and too much choline so basically any of those three that were too many were problematic maybe I maybe this was stretched across a couple of different papers so my my recollection is that I brought the fish up because my argument was it's really easy to just look at this stuff and say and repeat what we already believed about eggs and red meat bad for you and if you isolate it to that it kind of makes a clean story but it makes a really bad story if you bring fish into the equation because fish have so much TMAO that you're probably literally getting hundreds of times more TMAO exposure when you eat fish than when you eat those foods so my point was always how can you not bring fish into the discussion and yeah you yeah so now it's coming back to me you wrote a piece on this that I think will will be will be sure to link to I think the reason I had seen this fish issue separately was I was actually at an advisory meeting for a company that had asked me and a dozen other people a question which was should we be using TMAO as a new biomarker for cardiovascular disease and so it was part of this two-day meeting where we're sort of in this room looking at all of the data that somehow this someone else and I don't remember who it was came up with the idea of well wait a minute I mean we got to take a step back here I mean if fish has more TMAO than you could ever get from all of the red meat and eggs in the world it converting to

[00:43:24] TMAO it just seems to fail on first principles yeah and there were later papers that happened after those first two where there was some observational data showing the people who eat more fish have more TMAO in their blood I still get asked about this I don't know twice a year a patient will bring in a copy of that paper I think it was in nature or nature communications or something like that and say oh my god

[00:43:46] Peter like what do you think about this TMAO thing and it's just always one of those things where I kind of I roll and I just sort of send them a link to what you wrote or what Chris crecer and say go and read this and then come back to me and let's discuss why I am NOT particularly impressed by this thesis on a scale of one to ten I wouldn't say that my opinion that TMAO has negative properties in humans is zero I think it's maybe one or two or something like that and I'm willing to see what what they come up with there but on a scale of one to ten my view of the overall story that eating eggs and meat are bad for you because they alter the microbiome in a way that you take the colon and the carnitine in those foods and convert it into TMAO and make you as a red meat and egg eater uniquely vulnerable to heart disease I'm very close to zero on the probability of that story being true I'm totally open to seeing new studies on the ability of

[00:44:47] TMAO and plasma to be a biomarker and the potential for maybe eventually altering the gut microbiome in a way that generates more TMAO and actually I incorporate this on a practical level in some cases so even when I'm looking at choline supplements I overwhelmingly prefer that someone would get phosphatidylcholine which is the overwhelming form of choline it's found in food for two reasons one is it's the overwhelming form of choline found in food and the second is that it's the form of choline that's least likely to generate TMAO in the gut almost exclusively driven because its absorption is better do you dose at milligram per milligram in other words if you believe that 1,200 milligrams of choline is necessary no and actually that's very confusing on supplements because most supplements of phosphatidylcholine tell you the amount of phosphatidylcholine in them and they so you don't how much choline no you do you can just estimate that's about fifteen percent just by molar weight it's about fifty percent okay yeah I mean it's probably an imperfect number because probably most of the time the fatty acids are different in each molecule right so it's just an average but it's close enough right but directionally then you would want like nine or ten grams to hit yeah so it's only practical if you're taking tablespoons of lecithin yeah but you can get food so you could eat eggs right yeah so eating eggs and eating foods is the best way to get choline in my opinion but if I were to take some in a particular situation where for some reason they had one or two dietary restrictions and this way that made them not be able to get choline and you but they needed choline for these other reasons and you had to supplement I would do it with less than for those reasons and one of the reasons is that I don't know whether the increased TMAO that's generated when you take choline bitartrate is problematic your Bob the shownotes guy he's send me a paper that was just recently published where they fed people 500 milligrams of choline by tartrate over the course of two months and there they did an in vitro assay on their blood and showed that it was more sensitive to clotting so it's the level of that evidence isn't super strong but it's an indication that maybe having that level of TMAO in in your blood is bad but you cannot get that level of

[00:47:03] TMAO in your blood by eating four eggs which supplies the same amount of choline how do I know because Steve and Cecil's group did a study looking at plasma TMAO response to eggs and if you eat enough eggs you get a plasma TMAO response but it's three or four times lower than when you eat the same amount of choline as calling bitartrate and it's only anecdotal but at the time that I was involved in this discussion around developing an assay for TMAO it was during that three three and a half year window when I was on a really strict ketogenic diet and I was so I mean relatively speaking hyper caloric because I was also really active at the time I needed about 4,000 calories a day now 4,000 calories a day on a ketogenic diet means you are really having to limit your protein and carbohydrate so I was about two to three percent carbohydrate and about 8 to 10 percent protein and the rest was fat so it was one of you know what we would now call a four to one ketogenic diet although I didn't at the time think of it that way my point is one of the ways that I would had to make eggs is I couldn't just take 12 eggs and make scrambled eggs that was too much protein so I could only eat you know I'd have like maybe four whites eight yolks and then I'd have to fluff it with heavy cream so the point is I was mainlining this stuff and when the lab was sort of kicking around the idea of developing the assay I said I had already done some work with them where we had done like nine blood draws on nine consecutive days under various conditions and they already had the serum I said well let's look at the TMAO levels in there that should be a pretty good positive control and interestingly

[00:48:38] I had virtually none hmm yeah well in that study that I mentioned looking at the plasma TMAO response to eggs there was enormous variability and some people didn't really get I think everyone got some response to six eggs but there was a lot of variation on the for egg mark so half the subjects didn't get any response at all until they ate four eggs but some of the people got a very significant response to the four eggs which is what you'd expect based on what the Cleveland Clinic group is arguing which is that the gut microbiome is a big determinant well and that was sort of my conclusion which is again it was a very deep look into one individual me and that's irrelevant because any one individual is irrelevant but the thinking was I had me actually I still don't know what gut health means like the concept is so you know it's it's so difficult for me to an amorphous to describe but my intuition was something in my gut was really preventing this from becoming problematic I didn't know what it was I didn't know if it could be replicated but the story seemed a lot deeper than when it was being presented yeah I think one important point is that it's not about how many eggs you've eaten today it's about how many eggs you eat at a sitting so the only reason eggs generate TMAO is because there's some poorly characterized absorption cap to phosphatidylcholine and even though it's better absorbed than the other choline that's sold on the market there's some cap to how much colon you can absorb and no one really knows where it is there is it absorbed which transporter is it is it an enter a site transporter off the top of my head I don't know but it's got a yeah it's got to be in the small intestine does it come as a single phospholipid or is it esterified in some way I mean how does it actually come in from food you mean how its absorbed or how it you eat it so if you're eating you know a food that's high in phosphatidylcholine does it actually show up like the analogous free fatty acid or does it show up more as the analogous triglyceride where you get you know say two or three of these bound to a glycerol bound to other fatty acids like do these things actually show up as free phosphatidyl molecules so i believe that most of the phosphatidylcholine in most of the foods is going to be as phosphatidylcholine that are in cell membranes I see okay know you've answered that question okay so that's what I was wondering if it came in a more whole state or if it ever actually showed up like so well does it come in through a chylomicron I assume so I haven't looked at the absorption pathway for a while so

[00:51:16] I might not be remembering the details here but my guess is that you're gonna have partial hydrolysis of some of the fatty acids and then that's that the phosphatidylcholine is mostly going to wind up making its way into the mixed micelles and it's gonna become probably part of the membrane of a chylomicron would be my guess right but coming in the lumen of the gut and I get probably not even that relevant at this moment why I guess I'm just trying to figure out what the if the bottleneck is at the enter a site transporter and that's why you're limited and how many of these things you can get into the enter a site which then on the backside go into the chylomicron right that makes sense I mean back when I was trying to figure this out I asked Stephen Zeisel about this who if anyone knows about choline absorption or anything else about choline it's him and he wrote back and was like you know I really don't know I assume that there's some absorption cap and the small intestine I have no idea what it is interesting so the choline story is interesting and I think if you look at it overly simplistic aliy you could say well it's a good guy and a bad guy but it seems to be more of a good guy than a bad guy huh yeah I think so I mean certainly from the perspective of fatty liver that's clear yeah now we don't see

[00:52:29] I'm assuming although I've never looked at this in people who you would expect to have huge choline deficiencies which would be you know someone who's eating a very strict vegan diet right so by definition they're not eating any liver they're not eating any eggs they could certainly be eating lots of nuts nuts and cruciferous vegetables like beating now but let's assume they're on like the college vegan diet which is like you know they're eating as much crap as possible that has no animal matter in it is there data that would suggest we would see a higher incidence of fatty liver in that population I have no idea if that data is out there my guess is you probably wouldn't because probably those vegans aren't too fat but I don't know and this comes back to your point which is there's just something about adiposity if it's accompanied by visceral fat that is really stoking the fire yeah I mean if you take out all the in parts of the equation then there's just the choline is not going to matter that much it's just that it becomes the bottleneck to getting fat out when you have a buildup of fat in so what do you think are the role of different fatty acids in this problem and I guess we'll just define it for the listener right so we sort of loosely characterize fatty acids as either saturated monounsaturated or polyunsaturated we can further divide the polyunsaturated into a number of constituents I always think it's important that people sort of demystify this stuff and it were so quick to demonize one versus the other but it's as you said at the outset it's really just a bunch of really fun biochemistry a saturated fatty acid is specified by the number of hydrocarbons the number of carbons it has that's the chain so a c8 versus a c12 would have eight verses twelve carbons but being saturated just means there are no double bonds every carbon is fully saturated with a hydrogen and then of course you can finish the explanation for what a mono and polyunsaturated a mono unsaturated fat has one double bond to polyunsaturated fat as two or more double bonds that introduces a couple things so one one thing is that whenever you introduce a double bond you create a kink in the molecule so saturated fats are really you can imagine them as as it just being straight and linear and you can pack them together very well so saturated fats tend to be solid less saturated fats fats that are higher in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat tend to be more liquid so olive oil is more liquid than butter because it's mostly monounsaturated fat if you take olive oil and you put it in the refrigerator and you take corn oil or sunflower oil and put it in the refrigerator eventually the olive oils going to harden and the sunflower and sunflower oil wouldn't and that's because the sunflower oil is more polyunsaturated and that has even more resistance to packing together the other thing is that in a fatty acid with two or more double bonds so a polyunsaturated fat the carbon that's between two of those double bonds is very unstable and it is uniquely vulnerable to being damaged and we call that damaged lipid peroxidation so that fatty acid is not harmful in and of itself and in fact there are plugins fatty acids that are absolutely essential for us you alluded to these earlier we'll come back to them which is the omega-3 right no omega-6 omega-3 and omega-6 both polyunsaturated they're both essential to human physiology but it's also the case that the more of these that you have in your cell membranes the more of a liability it becomes because if you have oxidative stress if you have inflammation then all of a sudden those fats are more vulnerable to damage and it's very very tricky when you're talking about fatty liver because there was a human study that was about two weeks long that was published when I was in graduate school so maybe 2010 or 2009 this was they showed that over the course of a couple weeks polyunsaturated fats compared to saturated fats lead to less liver fat and it was very you know they used mr-s so as you know highly reliable data that they had and if you just take that at face value you say well there's one study that looked at it in humans there's a couple of observational studies over all poof Azur what you want to eat for fatty liver there's a problem with that which is that if you have fatty liver and it's mostly poo FFA's you are way more vulnerable to progressing from stea ptosis to stay out of hepatitis because you have more oxidative targets right yeah so if you look at the animal data it depends on the model generally you get more stea ptosis with longer chain lengths and more saturation and you get less stay ptosis the shorter chain length or with less saturation but if you have the stea ptosis you have a dramatic increase in the risk of progressing to stay out of hepatitis however in the alcoholic model there are studies showing that you get less stea ptosis with saturated fats and with polyunsaturated fats I think the reason for this is that oxidative stress does not just cause you to go from

[00:57:44] Nathalie II to Nash it also can cause stea ptosis because you get oxidative of the able B particle and so it's not just Colleen that allows you to export triglycerides from the liver you also need sufficient antioxidant protection in the liver because if you damage that particle before it ever exports to triglycerides then you prevent it from doing so I think the way you reconcile these different animal models is you say well an alcoholic model there's so much oxidative stress already that's provided by the alcohol because the alcohol isn't just a way to get fat in the liver the alcohol alcohols metabolism generates oxidative stress so you're taking a liver that doesn't yet have fat accumulation you're putting a bunch of fat into it and you're adding on top of that an oxidative flame so you actually wind up causing stea ptosis by causing oxidative damage to the april-b particles so that they can't leave the liver in that model so poof as I think are very complicated to think about because in the short term in someone who doesn't have a lot of stuff going on in their liver they're probably gonna be better if you look at a 2-week study and we have the data and humans showing that but I think in the long term if you're talking about the progression from state ptosis to gnash there clear disadvantage and I think if you're not talking about the healthy person who's got nothing wrong with them then they're who knows it's like 50 but in this 2-week study you're talking about presumably the subjects were fed disproportionately high amounts of PUFA versus SFA yeah do you recall like the magnitudes that they had to be fed to produce this phenotype I don't recall the magnitudes but they weren't ridiculously we're not a pretty were super physiologic no no they were basically the typical amount of fat that someone would eat but they controlled the fat intake so maybe people would prefer to mix the types of fats that are that are in their diet but and in that case it was atypical but they were they weren't feeding them 80 or 90 percent fat diets you know it's interesting you mentioned the a poby issue a poppy is used obviously in two ways in the liver you the first way we've talked about which is VLDL export which is our main way to get triglycerides out but but also we make de novo LDL in the liver and so in those patients do we see a reduction in LDL as well I don't remember that's interesting I feel like I want to start paying a little closer attention to this I I certainly can't even remember if they measured that I just haven't clinically seen that because I do seen a phildee all the time in the practice usually you suspect it with an elevated ALT disproportionate to ast and then an ultrasound will confirm the diagnosis very very rarely do you need an MRI and certainly never a biopsy but

[01:00:37] I haven't seen the association with an alteration in VLDL which we can estimate and obviously we can measure triglycerides in LDL it's also confounded by the way by different ethnicities so you know when you look at african-american patients even with type 2 diabetes we'll still have very low v LDL and triglycerides a Hispanic patient with diabetes will generally have a high triglyceride and a high V LDL and actually they're far more susceptible to naphthyl D an african-american and

[01:01:14] Caucasian is in the middle are you familiar with any of the data on some of those differences as it pertains to the lipid ology of these folks can we rewind a minute what haven't you observed with VLDL you said you haven't observed the association between blood levels of VLDL and an alpha B yeah what would you expect to see that you didn't I would have expected based on what we're saying to see a reduction in VLDL that the more naff will be they have the less vldls this idea well I think the problem with dad is that I mean I have an explanation for why that might not exist and here's the explanation in an ideal world that might make sense but there's another thing that's going on if you have naphthyl D you are very likely insulin resistant right if you are insulin resistant you are up regulating a possi 3 if you are up regulating a possi 3 you're VLDL are going to stick around a hell of a lot longer than if you do not and that's why we see these pathologic remnant v LDL particles that become atherogenic so when you are presuming we're both insulin sensitive our VLDL really don't pose much of an

[01:02:23] Astra genic risk because they stick around for such a short period of time so we don't have many of them they don't stick around long our a possi 3 is quite down regulated but if a possi 3 is up regulated and it's hard to measure this although Sam tameka's is working on an assay to do so you have VLDL now start to act like LDL they stick around long enough they have a high enough residence time in the plasma that they become atherogenic and so I do wonder if maybe why I don't not that this is scientific but the reason even my Gestalt is not to see that is maybe the less VLDL that's being exported in that patient because of the reasons you've described is offset by a longer residence time due to more a possi 3 right and when you also expect that from lower rate of uptake of triglycerides from peripheral tissues yeah that's a great point you have a lower peripheral disposal of triglycerides so the whole thing could be confined in other words it's a great point you raise actually we should take a macro step back this is a problem of flux and people struggle to understand flux because you can't understand flux with a snapshot you have to have the goddamn video right I mean that's the analogy you can't you take a picture of something you don't know the flux what's in what's out where it's being disposed of I love this point and one of the analogies that I like to use is although you can't use the picture how much information you have in a snapshot can have a huge effect on your ability to know what's going on you know imagine that you have a picture of a car accident well if you zoom in to the tire you might not and you need to look at that you don't know what happened you might not have any idea what happened the more you zoom out and the more different angles that you have at some point you can start to build a story of what probably happened based on that snapshot but if you're looking at one element in the snapshot you can never even so much as build a story about what probably happened and I think that yeah the idea that mistaking a concentration for flux is one of the overwhelming interpretive problem in science and in popular science in both yeah one of my biggest pet peeves so every quarter when I do one of these seven-day fasts I get a lot of blood work done on myself throughout the process and I get a real kick out of it because by the time you're five six seven days into water only you start to look like there are things that if looked at in isolation look horrible for example your free fatty acids get into the diabetic range so if you show that to somebody they think oh my god your ear diabetic and you're like really my insulin is unmeasurable my glucose is 60 milligrams per deciliter yes my FFA is two millimolar but my BHB is you know seven or you know five millimolar isn't it possible that what you're seeing is an incredible turnover of lipolysis and so yeah there's a lot of free fatty acid there but it's in motion it's in transit versus what I think is probably happening in the person with high FFA s who's got diabetes which is a much more stagnant form right of elevated FFA and so that's a muscle that's full of fat that's going nowhere versus the fasted person where that fat is being turned over very quickly and would you rather drink water out of a stream or out of a sitting pool with mosquitoes all over it exactly so no it's a good point and I like your point which is look the picture can be helpful but it has to be taken from a distance right so so if you just look at one tread of the tire in a photo you're probably gonna have no clue what caused the accident if you look at a huge picture you could at least see where the skid marks are of both vehicles ultimately there's no substitute for having a video of the accident right and and and those turn out to be the hardest things to do biochemically is to is to to generate tests that can actually show you the movement well biochemically what you do know though is that we've mapped out elsewhere biochemical pathways if you know all the possible sequences and you can measure all the metabolites you can often reconstruct what a video would have shown with fairly good precision I think it's just that we're only on the horizon of being able to do things like that but even still you know if you if you measure twenty things in some blood you can have a much better idea of what's going on what probably happened then if you measure one thing in that blood I should say 20 things in the pathway right yeah yeah and and and what you can get by measuring serially even a few serial measurements can be quite helpful I mean even just looking at something as you know simple I hate to say that but as simple as an oral glucose-tolerance test you look at somebody's fasting glucose and fasting insulin you have some idea of what's going on especially in extremes right so a person who's fasting glucose is 70 milligrams per deciliter and their fasting insulin is one the probability that they're going to have postprandial hyperinsulinemia is low but it's not zero similarly you look at somebody who's fasting glucose is 130 and they're fasting insulin is 30 the likelihood that there's not a trainwreck there is also virtually nil but if you're willing to sample 30 60 90 and a hundred and twenty minutes after a glucose challenge you can develop a very interesting kinetic a pathway using just two or three measurements you know I often get asked where will machine learning wreak the most havoc in medicine and my intuition is most likely radiology is the most obvious place for machine learning - I mean wreak havoc s' the wrong word but displace human you know ability I've often thought the ICU would be the second most valuable place just based on the reams of data that are coming out but I've never thought of this particular question right which is something is seemingly straightforward as looking at a bunch of biochemical metabolites and precursors and intermediaries there may be a very interesting opportunity here from machine learning to also start to differentiate but you know this question of flux I'm always asking myself that question when I look at a blood test which is this is a static test can I infer the movement the velocity or the derivative the time derivative of this molecule or that molecule so maybe maybe that is an interesting place for machine learning to start to play a role because

[01:08:58] I do suspect it will do a better job than yeah and what we what we do have taking it back to the fatty liver what we do have is not you'll never see this in your day-to-day clinical life but what we do have a studies where we look at labeled tracers and that's what shows that in a random sampling Nash people you have a seventy-five percent decrease in able B secretion it doesn't matter what the april-b in the blood is you'd like to know why it's higher but you know that it's not because it's coming out of it's not secure and higher that's a great point right it can be longer residence time at the VLDL the LDL the low you know that's such a such a great point okay so speaking of tracers which just prompted me to think of another thing I wanted to talk with you about let's talk about the most sought-after discussed asked about supplement on the market today which are nad precursors mmm I know I know you've got some feelings on this I have pretty I have pretty strong feelings on this topic too

[01:09:55] I'm trying to think how we can frame this so let's take a step back well let's let me do this for the listener who is contemplating whether or not they should turn the podcast off now or not because you've barely hung on to the biochemistry of choline and fatty liver disease most people have heard of NR nicotinamide right aside an ad as the sort of Fountain of Youth and if you've listened to other podcasts

[01:10:22] I've done specifically when I spoke with David Sinclair we talked a lot about sirtuins and the necessity of nad as a substrate to sirtuins what many of you have also probably heard of is there were a couple of companies out there that are making a very popular supplement one of them is called Elysium they make a supplement called basis the other was called chroma decks they make a supplement I think it's called true noggin if I'm right on that yeah I believe that basis takes nicotinamide

[01:10:51] Ryba side combines it with pterostilbene which is a sirtuin activator and that is their product and my recollection is that the true Nyugen folks are just giving nicotinamide right beside I don't know if they have a Sur to an activator in there but I could be wrong and it's probably not relevant unless you know the answer okay all right so the thinking goes as follows we have this little thing in our cells called mitochondria and they have all these little complexes and these complexes are basically used to generate reducing agents that move electrons to one side of a double membrane and it builds up a gradient and then that gradient allows us to make a bunch of

[01:11:31] ATP and that whole process is called oxidative phosphorylation the first of these complexes turns nad into NADH and uh pardon me NADH to nad so as the race as we age it has been postulated and maybe even observe that oh I don't know if it's been truly observed inside the mitochondria maybe it has that the ratio of nad to NADH goes down and if that's happening then you have presumably less nad with nad being an important substrate for sirtuins which do many things but primarily repair DNA damage it would seem that we would want more nad okay well they also have nad depletion because the sirtuins and the PARP switch is the other class of enzymes sort of using nad for the purpose of protecting

[01:12:18] DNA and telomeres and and all the things that are postulated to be important to aging and longevity they consume they're consuming the nad that's right absolutely which i think are two totally different things correct and there's another great example of it's hard to know why nad levels might be low is it low because of high consumption and high demand or is it low because of low so if you have if you're looking at the ratio of nad to NADH then I think that being in the overfed state is the thing that's the problem if you're talking about nad amount levels dropping then you're looking at consumption by the parts and circuits that are consuming it for the purpose of repair damage yeah so in an ideal world if you could wave a magic wand you would presumably want more nad inside your mitochondria tell us why that magic wand doesn't exist in why can't you just eat nad in other words I wouldn't say it doesn't exist but it's questionable how powerful of a wand this is so there's nice and R these are all forms collectively we call all this stuff niacin in the diet vitamin b3 and in the foods that we we primarily get nice in the form of nicotinic acid from plant foods we primarily get it in the form of nicotinamide from animal foods like if we stake a lot of the nice and it's in the steak is going to be in the form of nad or NADPH that is in those cells but all of that has to be digested and what we're absorbing in the intestines is either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide my guess is if you take a nicotinamide

[01:13:58] RIE beside supplement you are absorbing the NR in tact and if you take a nicotinamide mononucleotide supplement and and then you are probably digesting that down to NR or nicotinamide and absorbing them but we are definitely not absorbing nadh or nad in the intestines so when we're eating food once we go into the intera site we have nicotinic acid primarily being converted over to nicotinamide and the intestinal cell tries to turn that into nad but whatever the intestinal cell doesn't turn into nad itself it passes on to the liver so you're going through the portal vein now you have maybe some nicotinic acid left depending on how much you ate you have some nicotinamide in there in theory if you took a nicotinamide rye besides supplement you got some nicotinamide rabe aside in there then it goes into the liver and the liver is the main site that's really metabolizing all these forms for the entire body and what the liver is going to do is it's going to try to convert as much of those forms into nad as possible not even just for itself but because it's going to hold a reserve of nad for the rest of the body and then almost everything that comes out of the liver into the circulation is nicotinamide so the overwhelming thing that gets niacin out of the liver to any other tissue is nicotinamide that's the transport form and then those tissues will convert that into nad so what we definitely don't see is we don't see nad and NADH being transported in the blood there's some there but it's not a physiological transport way to get one something from one place to another if you take a nicotinamide right aside supplement you will get some nicotine my drive aside in the blood animal experiments suggest that there are trace amounts of that that will get into certain cells like muscle cells and be converted into nad but they're a physiologically meaningless amount of the nad that wound up in that muscle cell from taking that supplement overwhelmingly if you're talking about a tissue other than the liver what's happening is that supplement gets converted into nicotinamide reaches the other tissues as nicotinamide and increases tissue ad nad by that tissue taking the nicotinamide and making the nad but the first pass effect is pretty significant right so let's talk about the past the effect is basically complete we'll come back to n MN in a moment but let's just talk about NR NR becomes n MN becomes nad I believe in the cycle if you take it NR yeah yeah so if you take NR which is the two most popular supplements on the market with respect to this particular pathway the liver is basically to your point taking all of that NR and making nad correct yes so do we have a sense of how much nad actually makes its way into even the cytoplasm of a cell that is non hepatic in that situation nad that came from where that is derived ultimately from the NR that you ingested from the liver yes oh we know exactly what happens the liver turns that into nicotinamide and secretes it for the rest of the cells how much like a meaningful amount vision yeah well or just well I I don't I don't

[01:17:21] I don't know off the top of my head the amount but what I can tell you is that for all intents and purposes all of the nad that that is in any of your cells that are not deliver well actually I should say maybe 5% the the kidneys synthesized from protein but aside from that 5% in the kidney pretty much every and every molecule of nad is ultimately derived from circulating nicotinamide that the liver put out so in other words it's not the case that NR needs to be brought into a cell to be turned into nad it's that nicotinamide gets into a cell to be turned into nad it's not even needs to its Ken right because nad to my knowledge does not go from plasma into cell but it's hard to know if it does it does it just might be that you don't have enough in the plasma to justify there well you do if you're injecting it oh so this is interesting okay I want to come back I'm gonna park that because I want to like finish but I'm gonna come back to that so nicotinamide is the is the physiological circulating form of niacin that all cells will use to make nicotinamide I mean excuse me that all cells won't use to make an idiom minor exceptions are about five we can make some nice and from tryptophan and about 95 percent of that happens the liver in the liver five percent happens in the kidney so there is some some tiny bit of this that the kidney is making its own but overwhelmingly with that tiny exception at issues getting nad because it took nicotinamide out of the blood that the liver made from its store of nad now let me expose my ignorance in biochemistry and my forgetfulness nicotinamide is charged or not

[01:19:03] I know nad is but no nicotine light's not charged okay so nicotinamide makes its way into a cell through an active or passive transporter active transport I believe I would need to check that that's okay well we'll figure all that out once nicotinamide is in the cell how does it combined with adenosine etc to become nad it goes through two steps that are

[01:19:25] ATP dependent it gets converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide and then it gets converted into nad a portion of the nicotine MN nicotine my mononucleotide a portion of that becomes NR and then gets comes back to n MN and I don't know exactly why but I think it's like a pressure release valve so if you're trying to hold on to the nicotinic to more than the rate at which you can make the nad you might convert some to our to kind of hold on to it got it and then it comes back and wait to NR or to n mmm no to NR turner yeah so you have nicotinamide you go up to n MN you go up to nad you can go from n MN over 2 n R you have to go back over from NR to NM n to get n an idiot yep and I think of it as a cycle way easier to look at this in a picture that

[01:20:12] I have in my mind is nad going to n a M to n MN as a cycle with NR being a Popoff of n MN okay yeah so what you're talking about is in the case of nad consuming enzymes like sirtuins and parts that are using n a deferred for DNA repair and all those things we were talking about before what they do when they consume the nad is they release a nicotinamide so imagine you're a muscle cell you took originally to get every molecule of any do you have originally you took some nicotinamide and from the blood but then you did things with it some of those things were what you were talking about with oxidative phosphorylation you don't consume any D in that process you just cycle it back and forth you use it over and over and over know over and over again but some of the things that you did where the search ones and parts that are engaging in protection and those enzymes will consume the nad to generate nicotinamide the big problem here is that nicotinamide is an inhibitor of all those enzymes through negative feedback loop so you have to have to have to have to have to do something with the nicotinamide very fast or you need to methylate it to bring it back to the earlier discussion and pee it out so nicotinamide is circulating as the circulating form in the blood but intracellularly you don't let it hang out there you do something with it right so you take in the end nicotinamide and you either make nad or you get rid of it yeah actually I didn't even realize one could have free nicotinamide inside a cell which I guess you're basically saying but bone and momentarily momentarily yeah yeah yeah but it doesn't hang out there in that flow it doesn't okay so now let's go back to the question that I'm still trying to wrap my mind around which is if I give you a gram of nicotinamide rai beside you're saying none of that NR is basically going to leave the liver instead just nicotinamide is leaving the liver it is found in the blood so there's clearly there is some nicotinamide in the blood and we don't have the data in humans but we do have the data in mice isn't this what Josh Rabinowitz did in that very similar this is exactly what I'm referring to so the in his paper what he showed was that there is a little bit of nicotinamide rye beside that gets into the blood that there's a little bit that gets into them into some of the cells not others so for example it can't cross the brain at all it's fairly decent at getting into muscle if it's there there's not a lot there but what is there can get into the muscle and there is a little bit that gets turned into nad but the nice thing about his study was he was the way that he designed the tracers was they could see yeah you want to be able to separate the nicotinamide from the nicotinamide ride beside right well they could see even in at the level of detail as did like what was the history of this molecule before it became nad so they could differentiate inside the muscle so they could differentiate the pool of nad that the muscle made from nicotinamide rai beside they could from the pool that it made from nicotinamide even from the pool that it went through the cycle and then back right so they had extremely fine detail and what they showed was that there's a little bit in the Catena my dri beside that makes it into the muscle intact that pulled up the graph to try to see the amount and they have to blow up that part of the bar graph to show you what that tiny trace looks like it's basically practically meaningless now what they also showed in their papers and also in the same group published one in in 2016 what they also showed was that you do increase nad in the muscle a lot when you supplement with the nicotinamide right aside but it all comes from nicotinamide that the liver had made and circulated them and let's just make the math easy you take one mole of NR orally we've already acknowledged that the amount of NR that escapes the blood is so small you need a magnifying glass to see it so it's a

[01:24:16] Pico mole or something how many moles of nicotinic make their way into the cell again I'm sort of directionally speaking but order of magnitude is it more of it or like the majority of it or how much loss is there outside of the first pass effect is there an inefficient what are you calling loss are you calling increasing hepatic nad loss or are you calling alcohol loss anything that prevents the actual nicotinamide from making it into the cell I don't know off the top of my head what those numbers would be but I can come back I'll come back to their to the human data that chroma Dex has public that the chroma Dex people have published on that point but what I can say about the physiology is that there's a lot that doesn't get into any particular cell that isn't actually lost and I think is a really important point because in the the Rabinowitz group in 2016 they had another paper where they actually when you're listening to this I mean what's your thought right now would

[01:25:21] NR be more effective than nicotinamide eating it that's a good question my intuition would have been n MN would have been the best precursor if you could get it around the liver so as a thought experiment like SLE like under you know subliminal or intravenous NM n would have been my intuition is the best way to increase into some intracellular nad if you didn't have that choice if nicotinamide is the circulating form that's getting into the muscle what do you think that an NR is just generating nicotinamide that gets into the muscle yeah I think based on what you're saying

[01:25:59] I would now say nicotinamide per se would be a better substrate right but it's not in the - that's what I would think - I love how you walked me down there yeah well well no because as I'm saying this it sounds like why on earth why would you just say anything other than to divide right it's just gonna make nicotinamide anyway and I think this gets back to your waste point - in the 2016 paper that the Rabinowitz group put out they showed that and this was a minor portion their studies didn't have anywhere near as much data as they had on the NR but they showed that they got a much less nad response in the muscle with oral nicotinamide than they did with NR even though they also showed with very elegant tracers that it all got there is nicotinamide let me make sure I understood what you said you give oral nicotinamide and you are now asking the question how much of it goes to the liver how much of it leaves the liver also is nicotinamide it makes it to the muscle they didn't have all that data on it okay so they skip that step if they're asking the question in the muscle our goal is to increase nad in the muscle yep is it more effective to give oral NR or is it more effective to give oral nicotinamide and a minute ago I would have said oral nicotinamide but more like they showed they're saying the opposite they showed the opposite yeah here's the rationale that now this is kind of Meissen but the 2018 paper shed light on that now because now they had a tracer they had tracers in the 2016 paper to but they couldn't see how much tyrosine in the liver was being yeah they there was much more kinetic flux data in the 2018 paper that clarified you know if you had them on to talk about it I'm sure believe me and by the way the details I've tried to get Josh on a hundred times and Josh and

[01:27:47] I are friends cuz we went to medical school together and I just can't get him to hop on a train and come up here yeah if Josh I mean you're losing this just please just come up so we can talk about this yeah I'll just say what I learned about this paper race I read the paper I took notes I synthesized them I did my own podcast about this like so I think I have a pretty decent understanding that paper but though I'm sure there's details that I forgot so what I learned from that paper is a bunch of things like for example I know now that the average and AD molecule turns over every eight hours you consume in nad molecule in most tissues but it's every two hours and the liver things like that

[01:28:20] I know that the spleen and the small intestine consume 40 times more nad than the muscle and the fat does I know so there's a bunch of data in that paper but there's not infinite data about the proportion that went in in each compartment everywhere back to the point about why is it more effective to take the NR what I and this is what I think is going on what I think is the most sensible rationale that makes sense of this so in the liver you imagine that the NR the nicotinamide nicotinic acid whatever was you ate gets into the liver think about that cycle that we talked about before so we go from nicotinamide and we go up to n we go up to nad if we consume the NAD with sirtuins and parts we come back to nicotinamide and having that nicotinamide around as a liability because it's going to inhibit all the repair enzymes so we either want to make nad out of it or you want to get rid of it if you eat oral nicotinamide and you absorb oral nicotinamide into the liver and the liver gets it that oral nicotinamide is immediately a liability before it ever becomes nad because it can inhibit all those enzymes the sirtuins and the parts so the liver has these two has a bifurcation of what can it do with this it can methylate it to get rid of it and pee it into the urine or it can make nad if you take NR then you go into n MN you have to make nad before you ever generate nicotinamide and expose it to the detoxification process what I believe is happening and

[01:29:59] I think this is backed up by the animal data is nicotinamide right aside is a superior way to increase hepatic nad because when it gets to the liver it can't be immediately detoxified it's not immediately a threat to the sirtuins and parts and it can only make nad before it does anything else and again this is a flux thing right it's not like it's not like the liver says okay cells tell me what our balance of nad nnnn is on

[01:30:29] Friday and on Saturday I'll make a decision about how much to empty into the urine this is an immediate thing that's happening right now the liver says oh got two choices I either detoxify this or I do something useful with it and so if you're presenting it with that thing that's a threat and it has to make that decision it can only make so much nad at once at one time then you're gonna have much more waste in the detoxification pathway then if you put the thing in that has to make nad that is not a threat when it makes nad and that has to actually generate nad to ever be exposed to the detoxification pathway so you have to appreciate the central role of the liver in controlling the flux throughout the entire body the livers not just making an ad for itself it's making nad because it carries all of the reserves for the rest of the body as nad so the liver doesn't just have nad that's immediately being used in respiration and is immediately being used in search ones and parts it has a reserve pool of nad that it holds on to for the specific purpose of a slow release of nicotinamide to the rest of the tissues that they will take up and then they will have the immediate decision to either detoxify it or make nad but if the liver can hold on safely to the nad and have a better ability to release the nicotinamide on an as-needed basis and a continuous basis in a rate that the other tissues can take up and do something useful with then because you got a superior way of increasing hepatic nad you got a better continuous flux that was optimized of nicotinamide to reach the other tissue so they can make any D yeah so in that sense it's actually sort of parallels glucose right in the sense that we have to we have to maintain about Foxley grams of glucose in our bloodstream at all times so if you have 10 grams of glucose in your bloodstream you have diabetes you've got huge problems you're gonna go blind and get your toes cut not if you have 100 grams in your liver exactly but 5 grams is perfect and if by the way if you have 2 grams you die you know it's just it's an amazing problem where the liver is constantly titrating so you're basically drawing a parallel that says it's probably doing the same thing holding on to nad so in this analogy nad is to glycogen what glucose is to nicotinamide yeah is that a fair analogy it's a it's a fair analogy except there's a probably much larger percentage of the hepatic nad pool that's actually being liked proportionally they're different but yeah you know principle it's it's I think that's a good analogy so let's see if we can go deeper on that analogy there are a lot of people out there who

[01:33:17] I in fact I have a friend who came to me a year ago and he said I've got the greatest idea I'm gonna open up an IV nad clinic and we're gonna do nad and ketamine so give you ketamine to get rid of your depression and nad to make you live longer and I said well I'm interested in the ketamine because I do think that's a super interesting molecule for recalcitrant depression at least a year ago I said my understanding is giving intravenous nad is not going to increase intracellular or certainly mitochondrial nad and I don't know that that makes sense though any many friends who have done IV nad and they all say the same thing it's the worst feeling in the world oh I know I it's the worst feeling in the world say why we need to come back and say what is the role of free nad that's found extracellular lea mm-hmm I can guess what the role is what

[01:34:08] I can tell you is that one of the things it does is it activates granulocytes to cause vasodilation and a massively ramped up and so not unlike niacin no it's very different from niacin so niacin has a very similar response doesn't it at very high levels well yeah but biochemically what's happening is totally different oh it is okay yeah so why is niacin causing a flush it's not the same as NA DS flush so nicotinic acid is specifically nicotinic acid activates the nicotinic acid receptor and that is present on a bunch of immune cells that are responsible for the flush nurse but not necessarily great oocytes yeah so any D is acting on its a different receptor and you know I don't know maybe it's maybe it's Morse it might be more similar than I was leading on it's a different receptor but maybe the results are some I've never injected I've never had the flushing response and I've never injected an ad it probably is fair to say that they're similar in their results and that there are some similarities biochemically but it's not the same biochemical mechanism so if you do inject this nad what is it now you've bypassed the liver and it's sitting there in the plasma what's clearly happening based on the anecdotal reports of the immediate response to that is that they're that they are causing an inflammatory response what is not clear is the kinetics of where that nad is going right but there's there is definitely papers that I was able to find showing that there are a variety of mammalian cell types that do have the ability to take that nad into the cells but I look at this from the perspective of what is the normal physiology I don't I don't really want to know what can happen first I want to know what's supposed to happen mm-hmm then I'll build a theory about what I should do based on that right for people who are not injecting it how does nad get out of this cell in the first place well the details aren't worked out but it appears to be that nad extracellular nad is from dead cells from dying cells and maybe from cells that are undergoing some sort of stress response and are secreting it to some degree to reflect their energy status you mean as a signal as a signal interesting oh yeah I think it's very quick it can be a signaling molecule as well I think it's very clear that there if there is any role for extracellular nad it is as a signaling molecule and I think it's almost certain that there is a role for extracellular nad is a signaling molecule because there are fairly decently characterized enzymes that consume nad that are found extracellular lean it's a whole class of extracellular nad consuming enzymes so if nad is not ever supposed to be outside of the cell why would it be there and it's like well what are those enzymes do they break it down to use it as a signaling molecule so it's got to have it has to be the case that extracellular nad is primarily a signaling function and so it's definitely not a normal way of transporting an ad from tissue to tissue what the signal means I think we'll probably be debated if enough people care for a long time to come so I don't know exactly how to simplify and state what it means but it's very clear that it's a signaling molecule so when I look at nad injection unlike my idea is I'm going to transport this thing and that's definitely not the way you transport that thing and my body's idea is that that's a signal that means something about what's happening that is definitely not happening when I write because you're amplifying potentially a signal that's that's negative yeah and you know maybe that has good consequences because maybe it's some kind of rescue say

[01:37:53] No maybe that may be a stress cell puts an ad out and says come help me or come get rid of me because I I suck yeah but if that's the case gosh when you took a mother lode of nad in the plasma what are you supposed to go after every cell I mean how would you even differentiate where that signal where that alarm that's why I would never do that but I think if I'm trying to look if I'm trying to explain why are people experiencing been reporting benefits from it either it's placebo or it's doing something and if it's not just placebo with my guess is that it's probably it's probably having some signalling effect that is by virtue of luck doing something that the person is reporting is beneficial but I'm not gonna do that because I have no idea exactly what that signal means so what's your take then you know kind of going back to where we were a moment ago which is doing what seems to be much more commonly done which is taking oral nr or oral nmn okay so oral nmn I would bet money that it's not absorbed intact and that's because nmn has a charged phosphate group on it and generally charged phosphates cannot cross cells and so their hydrolyzed and even if it were to be true that there were transporters and the intestines I could take nmn up intact it probably still would not be absorbed intact because the phosphatase is in the small intestine that cleaved the phosphates off of everything that all the molecules in the food you eat do so non-specifically to all of the molecules in the food you eat so for example riboflavin when you consume riboflavin 5 phosphate I'm quite certain that none of it is absorbed intact were that because there were a specific riboflavin 5 phosphate phosphatase that just cleave that phosphate then I would say well I don't know about nice and I need to look for the phosphatase but that's not the case what is the case is that an a normally functioning small intestine you have this overabundance of nonspecific phosphatases that just cleave the phosphates off of everything that you're eating and that's because even though there might be some exceptions to the rule perhaps the overwhelming rule is that it's really difficult to carry charged phosphates across the intestines across cell membranes in general so I doubt that the

[01:40:21] ANA man gets in there intact and I think that if anything maybe it gets cleaved n R and the NR does I believe the N R gets intact because that's what the Rabinowitz group's paper showed that it was getting into the liver as aa SNR and because it makes sense because then R doesn't have a charged phosphate on it okay so we can simplify it and say let's just limit our discussion to NR and let's just say now we're taking Supra physiologic doses of NR which would be you know what's prescribed in these supplements sort of 500 to a thousand milligrams daily we you know using our glycogen somewhat oversimplified analogy we're now increasing our hepatic reservoir of nicotinamide that we can slow drip out when it's demanded because that's gonna be the better way to do it right so there's promise based on the animal experiments although there are in the human trials that they've done they haven't showed any benefit of doing this at all now what you mentioned Brenner I mean you didn't mention him by name but you mentioned chromatics tell me a little bit about their work I've looked at a couple of their human studies and they've done a couple of studies where they've characterized the metabolites that are produced when you take oral NR and they've done a couple studies where they tried to look for some benefits and didn't really find any so there's no benefits on glucose metabolism there's no benefits on lipid metabolism now were they doing these as kinetic studies or were they actually trying to look for phenotypic improvement in the first study they just took one person and they extensively characterized all the metabolites that were produced in three different compartments but then there were two and I don't know if this is comprehensive but in the studies that I looked at there were two other studies where they were measuring in different populations they were measuring things that you would relate to health like glucose and triglycerides and you're saying those things did not improve yeah in fact there's in one of the papers I believe it was two triglycerides went up a little bit and the potassium the serum potassium went down a little bit mean nothing that was that you wouldn't conclude anything from it mhm but it didn't it didn't look like it was doing anything good now I want to make a couple caveats here because these have been pretty short studies and my suspicion is furthermore they're not even measuring what we really care about right I also don't think they're measuring like what you would necessarily expect to see which i think is harder to measure so if you think about it think about the Rabinowitz paper which showed that the the turnover of nad is and this is in mice but and it's all we have right now the turnover of nad and the small intestine is 40 times what it is in muscle explain that to me I mean that is so counterintuitive think about it from the opposite perspective so we're thinking about life extension or health spanic extension with super physiological doses of NR think about the opposite case of pellagra which is nice and deficiency mm-hmm where do you see that you see the if you're an optimist you say the three

[01:43:16] DS of dermatitis diarrhea and dementia if you're a pessimist you say the four DS and you include death and in the brain what's going on is nad is actually generating molecules that are directly involved in immediate neurotransmitter production so I think that's why you see brain effects in pellagra but overwhelmingly if you exclude the brain the two tissues where you are seeing the most dramatic effect are the two tissues that are outside of the body okay so it's interesting I was gonna say is it because they're outside the body or is it because of the rapid turnover I think part of the rapid turnover is because they're outside the body I mean think about think about the quality control inside your body compared to outside your body and like think about once we cross the intestinal barrier ideally we have incredible control over what passes that barrier but we know control like what it encounters think about what goes into the toilet like would we want that inside our body in the number two right so I think part of the reason that nad is Sue and I'm guessing in their paper if they had characterized it in the skin that it would be high but they didn't so what do we know about what causes pellagra well when you're out in the Sun you're always experiencing DNA damage from that sunlight you're always paring it so in the skin you have this very incredibly high nad turnover in the skin because even things that you normally think are benign like just going outdoors is actually causing damage that that you are repairing always and so when you have the skin having a very I need to constantly repair itself and then you take away its ability to do that then suddenly you see this manifestation in the skin in the gut what's happening is I think part of it is that it's so energy intensive to maintain the cell turnover in the ground but it's also the case that just like the skin the gut is exposed to so many insults of just total lack of quality control over the things that come inside it and my suspicion is that where you would be likely to see benefits of increasing tissue nad over the short timeframe is going to be in those tissues with the highest turnover like you're gonna look at skin quality and small intestinal health both of which are very hard to wrap my mind around how you would design the ideal study compared to measuring glucose and insulin and triglycerides and lipoproteins right like you know exactly what you would measure from metabolic syndrome I would have to sit down and really think about how I'm gonna measure someone's skin quality or their small intestine wall over the long term what you would expect is increased genomic stability decreased accumulation of DNA damage an increased telomere length none of which have been measured but also why

[01:46:06] I mean I could certainly think of ways that those things could not be preserved even in the absence of gut and skin dysfunction in other words you could still see epigenetic damage in the presence of perfect gut and skin barrier right you're just saying you expect to see less of it if you created a better barrier you were saying that over the long haul you would expect to see less epigenetic change oh okay let me clarify the point that I'm trying to make is that if you're talking about a 12 week or 16 week time period

[01:46:47] I don't think you're gonna see any results unless you're looking for four specifically oh you're saying based on the non external benefits in other words to understand what it's doing inside all of the other cells in the body you're gonna do a much longer time exactly okay exactly and so we basically don't have much data because we have these week several week long studies in humans and if we're gonna look at things going on inside the body besides those tissues with super high turnover I think we're gonna have to look at longer studies that have more relevant endpoints so let's talk about it from the standpoint of harm because yeah the other way we can think about this is if your cost insensitive what's the downside and spending a hundred bucks a month which is about what you're gonna spend to take the party dose of these compounds so I think the potential risk is that you're sapping your methyl group supply and the reason is that like we said before part of this cycle is when you do generate nicotinamide you face the possibility that you have to methylate it and you have to pee out the methylated metabolite and then the question is well if you're taking a thousand milligrams or two thousand milligrams of NR a day which for the sake of putting some numbers on it the RDA for niacin is around 15 milligrams so we're talking yeah you are losing a lot of methyl groups and we know this in humans because the two papers that I found where they did measure methylated metabolites of the nicotine my drive aside and what you see is that in urine and in blood cells you see incredible increase in the methylated metabolites of nicotinamide like but wait so wouldn't you wouldn't a quick and dirty test be homocysteine should go up for example in a patient taking NR if they're losing methyl donors I no I don't think so I don't think that would be the most sensitive thing and I think we will eventually see a paper showing that that's not true because I've heard

[01:48:52] Brenner on a podcast say that he measured homocysteine and he measured s adenosylmethionine levels in the blood and showed that it doesn't have any if fact so I didn't see that paper so yours yeah but I think it will come out you're saying that you're always able to methylate folate even like we we just prioritize the methylation of folate high enough that even if we're losing methylation capacity to NR we're still gonna preserve it at the folio I guess so yeah I don't I don't know if we we might need to back up and talk about the methylation cycle to make this clear but you tell me so the most sensitive thing that changes when you have a change in the methyl group supply is your creatine synthesis interesting so I want to come back to that if we jump to methylation can we remember to come back to finish this because we do need to talk about

[01:49:42] MTHFR and comt and all of our other friends if we're gonna do I think it would be much easier to talk about the methylation of NR and what you would want to measure in a study to test I think once we've done them after all right so now we're gonna hopefully I'm gonna write this down we're gonna come back to this let's talk about that five letter acronym that pretty much everybody's heard of by now but nobody really knows what the heck it is what is an MTHFR gene and what is an MTHFR mutation and should anyone care alright so as we had said before a methyl group is a one carbon unit and the methylation cycle uses the amino acid methionine to donate that one carbon to dozens of different things so what we do there is we activate methionine to s adenosylmethionine using ATP and s adenosylmethionine is the universal methyl donor so no matter what we're talking about synthesizing what we're talking about regulating it is always s adenosylmethionine that donates that one carbon that methyl group it becomes through two steps it becomes homocysteine which is the inevitable byproduct of using it and once we have homocysteine we have two choices we can either get rid of the homocysteine if we have an abundance of methyl groups or if we don't have enough methyl groups we will recycle the homocysteine back to methionine there's two ways to do that one is that folate which is vitamin b9 can take a methyl group from amino acid metabolism and can pass it on to b12 b12 passes it on to homocysteine homocysteine regenerates methionine or choline can be oxidized to beat it in which can be then the methyl donor to recycle homocysteine to methionine those two pathways are equivalent in the average person they're probably 50/50 but it's going to depend on their dietary intake to your question about

[01:51:46] MTHFR the MTHFR enzyme is one of the enzymes that is involved in constructing the methyl group that came from the amino acid metabolism that went on to the folate molecule and that's how folate passed the methyl group on to b12 and then on to homocysteine to recycle meth I mean there's a lot of people going around saying I have MTHFR well we all haven't we all have MTHFR I have ATP exactly it's not just misleading because we all have MTHFR it's also misleading because there's actually if you look at the two common polymorphisms which are gene variants in the MTHFR gene they are so spread out in the population that what you actually see is a gradient of

[01:52:33] MTHFR activity that's a fairly even spread across the population so you could basically divide the population into quintiles of MTHFR activity and you'd see it wouldn't be exactly 20 20 20 20 20 but it would be fairly close to that so if you have limited ability to use folate for methylation there are several things happen that happen the first is that you use up more choline and you do that because you suck at using folate and you have no problem using choline so you basically say I'm not that good at using this pathway and you use the alternative and that nutritionally that makes the choline requirement go up at the very beginning of this podcast I said that I'd seen some studies where some people need 1200 milligrams of choline that's the people with the worst MTHFR activity what happens is there were two different populations that were studied and exactly what happened to their choline metabolism was due for an each population but the commonality when the worst function is remind me it's a CCC which are tttt CC which snips would be the quote unquote worst the worst case for MTHFR is the c6 70 70 homozygous homozygous a or homozygous 440 instead of yeah yeah yeah so it's the TT and then on the a one two nine eight C it's like yeah for the a12 98 see that one is less significant than the c6 seventy seventy but you can have both of them so in the in the best case you have neither of them that's like ten or fifteen percent of the population but the next step up to have a little hit is to have your basically a CA or a CT and you're functionally pretty close to normal - I like the way you described it actually which is think of it in quintiles yeah and and I would even say it's less than quintiles because to your point in my experience I only see maybe 10% of people that are wild-type in both that's pretty freakin rare I mean I would be surprised exactly what I would be surprised at 10% no it's not right it's not exactly quintiles but it depends it depends on what population you look at - it's gonna vary but it's you know it's basically there's there's a little bit in each category and there's not a category that has and it even has a large minority of the bliz right it's not it's not even like a PO where you can say well the two twos are basically unheard of and the three threes the while there's no one that's unheard of yeah yeah it's almost like I don't really know what the wild type really is yeah I think it's misleading to call it even wild type and to say you have the mutation yes it's really like there's a spectrum that's more can even more convincing than gender right in this case it's like a very even literal even spread like no one could make a case for binary ism in

[01:55:22] MTHFR so let's for the sake of being overly simplistic which is not necessarily a good thing but to illustrate this point let's compare the best methylate errs to the worst methyl Eaters meaning let's take the top and bottom quintiles of MTHFR function to now illustrate the point you were making a moment ago or interrupting right and that's I mean that's really where we have most of our data from so if you compare the best then I don't even want to call in the I know I know because they're not bad meth leaders they're pretty good because they're using up their choline to do it so if you compare the people with the best methylfolate status compared to the people with the worst methylfolate status the people of bad methylfolate status are the people who are doubling up the amount of choline that they're blowing through for the cycle now that said Chris it's hard to deny I mean I'm getting to the point where one of my favorite games to play because I just love to play games with myself when I'm reviewing a patient's labs I like to predict a homeless cysteine based on an

[01:56:20] MTHFR and there's an undeniable correlation which is not to say I can always predict it but when I look at your MTHFR status the lower you are in your capacity to efficiently do so the higher your homocysteine is all things equal now wouldn't we expect that if they're truly as efficient at methylation even using choline shouldn't they be able to compensate for that okay so right I think I probably misspoke when I said they're just as good math leaders because they're using choline yeah it's it's a compensatory response but the thing is what you see in the literature at least is that studies that can show a statistically significant rise in homeless esteem it's generally limited to the the people who are in the worst case scenario what's interesting that I think no one is talking about and I didn't even really even realize this until last week is that if you subdivide those people by their riboflavin status all the people who have the MTHFR genotype that look bad that have high homocysteine have bad riboflavin status and the thing that lowers MTHFR activity with those polymorphisms is that MTHFR is a riboflavin dependent enzyme which is vitamin b2 and it has a lower affinity for the riboflavin as a cofactor and so you need better riboflavin status to optimize your MTHFR this is so counterintuitive you know because the thing we find clinically that is the best hammer is b6 because you're not thinking about it about optimizing the MTHFR activity you're thinking about getting rid of the homocysteine that's right right and do you think that's the course way to think about it clinically yeah I think it's the wrong way to think about it I think it's too simplistic uh-huh but if someone has high homocysteine goes away with b6 supplementation that person probably needed a high b6 we should talk a little bit more about how this pathway is regulated so I have a feeling this is going to be a set of show notes oh it's gonna have something really awesome diet yeah I actually sent send Bob 30 slides on this thank you okay so let's say that you eat a steak there are some good things and bad things about that one thing is that you have a bunch of a thiamine in there and you can use that methane in for methylation one of the negative aspects of that is that if you have this boatload of thining that comes in you're going to generate a boatload of homocysteine and you also don't have the problem of needing to recycle that homocysteine because you've got a boatload of Athenian coming in in fact it's probably dripping into the liver and you can probably predict that if you have a lot right now you're gonna have even more coming in ten minutes from now and even more coming in 10 minutes from now so what do you do you totally shut down and THF are you totally shut down the enzyme that uses choline so you're not recycling it anymore and then you flip on this other enzyme that's not usually active that gets rid of the homocysteine by just breaking it down and then on top of that you want to get rid of the extra methyl groups and you turn on this other enzyme that is going to use the amino acid glycine as a buffer and then that glycine is going to if it can hold on to the methyl group for later use but if you methylate too much of that glycine you end up peeing it out so in this context what the b6 is doing is it's activating the enzyme that kicked on when you ate the steak that helped you break down the homocysteine so a person has high homocysteine that goes down the part of the point that I want to make here is that they're not different parallel ways to do the same thing your MTHFR shuts down in the fed state if you ate protein the enzyme that uses we say protein do you mean specifically methionine well there's no finding a net in every protein there's more methionine in eggs there's more methionine in meat compared to plant foods but there's enough methionine that if you just eat a meal that has a reasonable amount of protein you're going in this direction so take the opposite situation which is the amino acid that Falls most quickly when you fast is methionine we don't preserve methionine the way for example we preserve branched chain amino acids in a non fed State so three days into a fast you should have very high MTHFR activity yes how this ties back to the patients with the b6 is that it's it's proof of concept that the b6 worked that the problem you addressed was not MTHFR that means that part of their high homocysteine it was a result of fed

[02:01:02] State homocysteine that should have been broken down using the vitamin b6 that wasn't broken down because they didn't have enough b6 the b6 is working because as people need to be more b6 so this is actually very interesting Chris so it's almost like we should define how much methylfolate and how much methyl b12 one needs even in the presence of MTHFR mutations that are quote unquote bad and if they're still not lowering homocysteine flogging them with more of that is not the answer you have to move to TMG or or b6 or something like that so you know I think the typical supplement we would give a patient would have 400 micrograms and methylfolate and maybe 800 micrograms of methyl b12 does that seem like even overkill reasonable more than sufficient I think it's reasonable yeah and if that's not fixing the problem you got to look elsewhere well you're not going to fix MTHFR with methyl Foley no no sorry if that's not fixing the homocysteine you haven't identified what the deficit is yes but we went down this direction because we were talking about is homocysteine a good indicator of whether you're messing up your methylation so I think homocysteine yes there's data saying maybe the homocysteine is a problem in and of itself because it caused oxidative stress and might contribute to cardiovascular disease but mostly it's but it's also just a marker that things aren't working right in that cycle but it's not the only thing that goes wrong in that cycle you have other alterations so for example what I had said at the very beginning of this about some people need 900 to 1200 milligrams of choline that's because people with and you're not gonna fix this by fixing homocysteine people who have low MTHFR activity are doubling the amount of choline that they blow through and they have problems that are a result of not having enough choline that have nothing to do with homocysteine whatsoever that need to be fixed by putting more choline into the system so I'm not telling you that their homocysteine is gonna go down when you put the choline in maybe it will there's Colleen's a methyl donor but what I'm telling you is that the data indicate that those people have a higher choline requirement and the way that you address that is by consuming enough choline is there then a relationship between MTHFR and propensity to fatty liver disease given that a subset of patients are gonna be burning through choline quicker and therefore have less choline to do its job in the liver I would expect that that could be the case off the top of my head I don't know if data on that what I do hopefully there's a graduate student listening yes who's going to pick because that'd be a really interesting and elegant experiment what is right that what I do know there's data on is showing that 900 at 1200 milligrams of choline will do two things one it will minimize markers of oxidative DNA damage and I'm not even sure if that mechanism is and the second thing that it does is it just you know it brings choline utilization markers back down to what you would find in someone who didn't have them th if our polymorphism and it comes back to everything that we said before about the relative fluxes right so if someone's using up their colon more for that processor

[02:04:15] I wouldn't necessarily expect them that fatty liver but I would expect them to have a higher probability of developing it if you put the other conditions in and again just going back to what you said earlier you would generally recommend people supplement with phosphatidylcholine versus choline I would prefer food and if you're gonna do a supplement of prefer phosphatidylcholine over a choline salt so where does comt fit into all of this because it's another enzyme it's involved in the catabolism of catecholamines talk a little bit about that so part of moving beyond homocysteine one whole side of this equation is what are you methylating right because homocysteine is a byproduct the methylation cycle what your methylating is ninety percent of it is to synthesize creatine and to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and then the other 10% is a gradient of a handful of things that are fairly sensitive to methyl group surpri and a lot of things that aren't if you look at the next most sensitive thing to creatine synthesis it's dopamine and comt is the enzyme that methylates dopamine basically what it does is it modifies dopamine metabolism in a way where if you methylate more dopamine you are mentally more flexible and if you methyl eat less dopamine you are mentally more stable and if you're in the middle of that it could just be a variation of your personality but as you start to get to the ends of that spectrum you start to get into the possibility of psychiatric disorders that could be a result of being in the extremes but in the middle of that spectrum they talk about the warrior phenotype and the warrior phenotype so the person who's the warrior w AR is the person who has a higher rate of methylating dopamine it's more mentally flexible and that's the person that picks the battle faces it picks the battle faces it defeats and just moves from one thing to the next the worrier gets stuck on things they're worrying about but you look at just like

[02:06:22] MTHFR activity look at comt activity and it's a perfect spread there aren't as many different types it's basically like 50% of people are in the middle 25% are in one and 25% around the other end why is it spread like that because there's a trade-off and so I think the worrier worrier phenotype is a bad way to talk about it because actually the people with the so-called warriors the so-called people who worry wo wo yet it's hard to pronounce that exactly right so the people who have a low rate of methylation they're also better at doing a lot of things that require sustained focus so better academics there was a recent study that came out that showed that competitive swimmers who are the low methylation phenotype get better results they appear to do better competitively and there was another study in elderly people that found that if you do a an exercise intervention the people with the low comt phenotype are more likely to do more exercise because you told them to so these are people where things get stuck in their mind and things getting stuck in your mind is great if it's the right thing you know so you are predisposed to worry more because if you get an anxiety producing thought or a depression inducing thought in your mind it gets stuck there more but also if you're gonna focus on work that needs to be done if you're gonna focus on goals you might be better at that because you've put the right thing in your mind and you had a better ability to make it stick there is the other group the warrior group more susceptible to addiction yeah so if you look at the associations of the genotypes with different psychiatric diseases the ones that are most clearly related to impulsivity or getting stuck on stuff are the ones that seem to be most consistently correlated so obsessive-compulsive disorder is associated with the low methylation phenotype whereas substance abuse and

[02:08:22] ADHD are associated with the high methylation phenotype then when you start looking at other psychiatric disorders you start to get into a lot of noisy data when you look at depression and anxiety and panic disorder and things but just taking the extremes how strong are those hazard ratios off the top of my head I don't know directionally are they really are they meaningful are we talking about hazard ratios of 4 and 5 we'll be talking about like 1.17 I genuinely don't remember I can put a meta-analysis of this in the show notes that have okay that would be great that I mean because this is one of those things that only only once have I ever been asked about this and I didn't know the answer of course but one of my page asked me to go back and look through his genetic data to look at which snips he had for comt specifically because of this question oh yeah I don't think it has much diagnostic utility I find it interesting from creating a theoretical model of how this stuff works and I think part of the reason some of the data so noisy about like let's say things in the middle like depression and anxiety which they do correlate and their studies that show it one way but it's just very noisy data I think part of the reason so noisy is that it's not really about the genetics that you see really strong associations with genetics when you have a mono genic disease of which there's like 73 right I mean like virtually no it's not the norm right when you're talking about this it's like

[02:09:48] CMT is not a gene for a mental state right it's a gene that has a partial influence on the stickiness of your mind and the way that CMT methylates dopamine is with all the methyl donors so nutrition is gonna play directly into that and so your comt genotype isn't even going to tell you the rate at which your methylating dopamine it's gonna tell you the rate at which you could methyl a dopamine given a certain supply of methyl donors you've put a lot of time into this Chris and and we'll make sure we link to this but you've basically done probably a better job than anyone I know of at codifying the if you have this mutation this would be a great dietary strategy it would take us another 12 hours to go through all of them let's touch on three of them you pick but it seems to me that the comt

[02:10:35] MTHFR would be an interesting one to at least start with sure so MTHFR I think what you want to do is number one you want to get between 900 and 1,200 milligrams of choline a day that is your preference clearly you sort on the right calling but get it from your food get if like if you can eat enough eggs and yep you know yeah so there's that and that is that has the most data backing it out of everything else that I'm gonna say but supplementation with creatine makes a lot of sense because 45% of your methyl demand is to synthesize creatine and just to put this in perspective for the listener when people think creatine these days we think about creatine monohydrate versus creatine fate which used to be the sub the supplement monohydrate right so creatine monohydrate is something that most people take for exercise they take about 5 grams a day back when I was in high school we used to load it we would take 20 grams a day for five days than 5 grams and we'd cycle on and off you're probably not old enough to have been in that meathead phase but the most recent literature is no I did that you the tradition lived on it's still on the label is it really although the most recent literature I've seen said just monohydrate 5 grams a day is plenty but again for most people we think of that as creatine is a phosphate donor and in certain types of exercise I eat the most high intensity so weight training for example that burst is really a phosphate donation from creatine it's not an ATP driven process I actually wasn't really aware of the role of choline in synthesizing creatine it's a role of methylation in synthesizing creatine and so that whole cycle whether you're taking the methyl groups from choline are you taking the methyl groups from foley what you do when you synthesize creatine is you start with guanidine o acetate which you make from the protein in your diet and then you methylate it and that makes creatine so literally creatine is the only thing that is super sensitive to the methyl group supply so you ate that steak you synthesized creatine five hours later you're synthesizing nowhere near as much creatine in the Holston the whole system so creatine tracks much more closely to say methionine than leucine yeah because the rationale is that some things are so essential to the body that you don't want them to ever change with the methyl group supply so DNA methylation for gene expression you don't want to regulate thousands of genes because you ate a steak and you had a bunch of extra methyl groups you want to control that for totally different reasons so that's designed to almost never change then there are other things that have to be fairly acutely stable like your dopamine and other neurotransmitters you don't want that to go up Matt yeah Lock Isis you ate right but your creatine you average person has 120 grams of creatine in their body and they lose two grams of creatine every day in the form of creatinine that they pee out in their urine and so the whole point of creatine synthesis is to keep the accounts balanced so if you synthesized no creatine and for an entire day your creatine in your body is going from 120 grams to 118 grams it's like barely a dent so creatine is the ideal thing to vary with the methyl group supply because you can eat a steak you can do all your creatine synthesis when you were when you had enough methyl groups then 5 hours later you're in the fasted State and you you don't synthesize creatine anymore it doesn't matter because it's not a neurotransmitter it's not doing an acute thing you just have to make sure that in 60 days from now your creatine isn't zero it's still 120 grams in your body what determines the phosphorylation status of creatine about 120 grams how much of it has an inorganic that just completely unrelated from the synthesis that's a matter of the energy state of the cell so just like ATP gets used when you use energy creatine phosphate in when you're in so instead of do we have an enzyme so the way that you know for example like AMPK is a great surrogate for ATP adp a MP right it really gives you a sense of the energetics do we have similar enzymes that give us a sense of C P versus C creatine phosphate versus creatine I don't think there's an analogous enzyme but there's a completely analogous energy state so when you're exercising for example your ATP levels go down your aim peak levels go up your creatine phosphate levels go down your creatine levels go up when you recover everything reverses so this is most studied in muscle but in an exercising muscle if you do weightlifting to failure you're gonna see the creatine phosphate go from about a hundred percent down to about forty percent at the point of failure and then you rest for five minutes and you're gonna see most of it recovered so by that logic I mean the reason athletes like to use creatine is for increasing that maximal performance or the duration of short maximal performance right it's not going to have it act on your ability to run a marathon but it's certainly good I think it will have an impact on your ability to run a marathon you do yeah interesting because creatine does things in muscle that are independent dependent of a phosphate donation yes so the another thing that creatine does in muscle is that it hydrates the muscle more and see you literally that's not sure yeah I mean that's a given just based on the amount of water that travels that is a direct factor in strength in a way that has nothing to do with the duration of the exercise yeah so for the listener they should know that for you know anyone who's taking creatine knows this you're gonna put on about four or five pounds and it looks sort of like muscle I mean it shows up in the right places but a lot of its just water moving to the muscle that's water that directly increases your muscular strength you know interesting so it's not just you know cuz a lot of guys will say well that's great because I look bigger but the reality of it is actually functional and they're stronger yeah you know you could get that amount of creatine if you just ate a few pounds of meat every day and apparently there's a diet going around these days just that but I'm not willing to compare the extent to which is important to kind of modify your diet around MTHFR really depends on what problems are you facing and what goals do you have and to what degree do you want to be anal about doing things that that have theoretical payoff right so I think that for someone who has either high homocysteine or they have psychiatric difficulties what you would expect from the low methylation State is for for someone to be overly ruminating on things and so if you feel like that's a problem for you and you feel like what you would typically do to be psychologically healthy is an uphill battle because of your physiology it might be and so in that case you I think you would stick more to that protocol so obviously taking creatine increasing your choline amount is the most data back thing but taking creatine makes a lot of sense because if you cut your methyl demand in half then it's probably gonna matter half as much that you're not that good at methylating right so you increase choline because that's the alternative methyl donor you put creatine into the system because that's the demand but there's another overlooked thing here which is that methylfolate is I don't know if you want to go into the reasons why but let me just state as a fact for faith acceptance methylfolate is the thing that controls whether you pee out glycine as a methyl buffer if your methyl folate level is low I'm closing my eyes because I'm now trying to figure out how trimethylglycine will fit into this because I have an anecdote to share with you so well trimethylglycine is beatta eaten which is a thing that you make from choline finish your story I'm going to come back to this interesting anecdote because I'm

[02:18:27] I'm looking forward to you explaining to me why I observed this case but keep going okay this when your methyl folate level is low your body thinks that you are in a state of methyl abundance and that you need to methylate glycine and pee out the methyl groups and the glycine into the urine and so you probably need more glycine as well no one's quantified it no one's actually shown that that's the case but what we know is very very data backed in terms of how does the system work and everything that we know about the system how the system works says if you have low methylfolate levels you'll lose glycine in the urine as methylated metabolites and so that means that you do want to put methyl foley in there because you want to try to have some there to stop that but you probably need more glycine and what we know is that we can synthesize glycine but the average person probably should fall short of their ability to synthesize glycine by 10 to 60 grams a day in terms of optimizing collagen turnover in the skin and etc etc etc we also know that there are studies showing that people get better sleep if they take three is six grams of glycine before bed at night people have better blood sugar if they take 3 to 5 grams of glycine with a meal so it's entirely reasonable that the average person could use more glycine and so I think it's entirely reasonable to say maybe throw some bone broth in here or throw some collagen in here or some gelatin or some glycine do you think it matters whether you're getting it in bone marrow bone broth versus a supplement it would be in the bone broth and I think big differences are between getting collagen in versus getting glycine powder so for collagen and collagen is what you would get in bone broth it's been shown to be better at increasing collagen synthesis is that see is it I never understood why that's the case

[02:20:25] I've always kind of thought that that makes no sense because you eat a bunch of collagen what basically emerges from your gut is free amino acids no there's some collagen peptides there's some dye peptides in them I mean how robust are the data on that I don't know how robust they are I've actually told patients on a couple of occasions that have insisted that they take their College and that I just don't think it's helping them well I can believe that for the benefit of replacing their own collagen I've always been like I just don't know that works I mean the other thing right there is no good data showing that you will have less wrinkles if you take collagen I have never heard of any data on bone health the other stuffs more interesting frankly if you if you tell me that five grams of glycine in the form of collagen will produce better glycemic control and better sleep that's more interesting I'm pretty sure all of the blood sugar studies were done with glycine powder I might be wrong about that I know the sleep studies were done with glycine powder all I can think of off the top of my head for a study that was done and this wasn't even with college and it was with a gelatin which I would assume would be the same you know his last name is bar I forget his first name but there was a study that showed that before you exercise if you take 15 grams of gelatin but not 5 grams with a little vitamin C you will increase collagen synthesis in the tendons and the rationale for the study and actually I didn't even look at this paper I just listened to an interview that he did about it but the rationale was that in your muscle your muscles very metabolically active very good at taking things up when it wants to but the connective tissues in your joints are very dependent on you just pushing more blood supply there and so when you exercise you have the amino acids coming in before you exercised and then when you're exercising there's an increased blood flow that gets the collagen peptides into tissues so part of my ideas here are speculation based on why this works and so I'm I'm using the reasoning that we would expect those like probably if you were measuring plasma glycine levels and those people you'd find lower levels of plasma glycine and you'd find higher levels of the methylated metabolites of glycine probably if you looked in the urine you'd find those things and so it makes logical sense to say that you may need more glycine and so you can put into your diet in these ways but ultimately this is like what foods would be high enough in glycine if someone was sort of opposed to say skin and bones yeah but including like chicken skin and things like that so bones are the highest and skin is intermediate and bones to your point it's not the marrow it's the broth you make from the bone yeah it's not the marrow it's the broth and it's dependent on the protein content so if you're making it homemade you don't know exactly what the protein content is I would use the metric of whether it's well gelled mm-hmm if you assume you can trust the label there are several bone broth products on the market where they say they have 10 grams per cup and if they have 10 grams of protein or 10 grams of glycine 10 grams of protein which should be about 3 grams of glycine oh my god so you got to drink quite a bit of this stuff well a cup is 3 grams of glycine yeah but if you want to you know that's that's the bottom of your 3 to 5 yeah you're gonna do it you're gonna drink that before bed every night it might help you sleep right in theory ok so now that we've walked through the methylation stuff I still want to go back to this and are ya man yeah yeah because this is what got us down this path right so so in the studies done by Brenner what we do know is that an enormous amount of this NR is getting methylated as nicotinamide I don't think it's possible to extract the data from those papers and say exactly how much because they're in concentrations and when they're in urine they're not in a 24-hour collection there in spot you're I don't know exactly like what's up and down fluxes over time but what I can say is that just as a rough calculation to get a sense of how much impact you could have if the impact were maximal for every thousand milligrams of nicotine amide that you detoxify you are in theory decreasing your synthesis of creatine by 500 milligrams so you're synthesizing 2 grams of creatine in a day so if you're taking 2,000 milligrams of nicotine oh my driver-side if all of it were detoxified you'd be cutting your creatine synthesis in half but in theory

[02:24:58] I mean that means that your own from 120 to 116 instead of 118 right in a day you're talking about whole body creatine stores I'm talking about so you're talking about at the cellular level - first of all no one's taking this for a day they're taking every day if you're taking it right and you don't need your creatine to go to zero before you have problems like the bodybuilders and the athletes are taking creatine because they're hoping to maybe increase their body stores by about 30 percent so just leveraging a little bit marginal increased creatine makes big results in your strength we should clarify that although 90% of creatine is in your muscles and although the most famous reason to take creatine is to support your exercise performance it's also been shown that 5 grams of creatine a day improves depression and women with major depressive disorder and if you just look at the physiology of creatine for God's sake you're using it to make your sperm swim and you're using it to pumps acid into your stomach so creatine is important in all kinds of areas that you would not expect to think about it in so if one was gonna take creatine which I probably haven't taken since Nam you wouldn't just take it during exercise like if you wouldn't just take it on the days that you were lifting weights you which let's say you're doing that 3 or 4 times a week you would presumably want to take it daily take that 5 grams daily correct yeah I mean I think on the whole although you could say that it might be better if you take it after exercise with a carbohydrate bolus it might be better if you split it up into two doses on the whole if you just take it every day and you take 5 grams a day and you just always do that you're eventually going to get to the video yeah exactly yeah it's something to take daily if you're doing that but let's steer away from the person who doesn't care at all about creatine supplement they're not even thinking of that what

[02:26:49] I'm thinking about is what would you want to do in an N our study to show that you're not impacting methylation so I expect that sometime rather soon we're gonna see a paper coming out showing that it doesn't elevate homocysteine and showing that it doesn't affect the s-adenosylmethionine in plasma and it's not my position is not that this stuff is really dangerous that's not my position at all however

[02:27:16] I've been exposed to anecdotes of people who are taking this who experienced things that were really see-sawing in their energy levels and were really see-sawing in their mental and emotional states that are anecdotes that could be explained by a thousand other things but to me make it sound like geez this thing is really sapping the methyl group supply it's exactly what I would expect to happen in someone whose methyl group supplies beings and would that person be better off supplementing with choline or creatine if they were going to pick I would say take a lower dose of this stuff and match it with a methyl donor in yeah in theory you could do creatine you'd have to test it right but my recommendation I actually put out the recommendation I made a video about this

[02:28:05] I said we'll link to I said match at milligram for milligram with TMG trimethylglycine oh that reminds me I want to tell you bout this anecdote so we've got a patient who you just couldn't get his homocysteine to budge so on our lab scale below like nine or less is what would be normal he's in the 13 14 15 region on your standard dose of methyl folic methyl b12 nothing even doubling it which always makes me a little uncomfortable nothing adding you know 50 milligrams of b6 three times a week which strikes me as an overkill nothing going to be 650 milligrams daily nothing add TMG boom yeah almost cysteine Falls by 50% what was going on in this guy okay so the fact that you added b6 and it did nothing indicates one of two things either that guy's enzyme for getting rid of the homocysteine didn't work that well or more probably this was not a Fed

[02:29:01] State homocysteine issue right so the way these things work is you're trying to use MTHFR or choline to rima flight homocysteine when you're in the fasted State and you don't have a lot of methionine coming in you stop doing that entirely and you start trying to break down the homocysteine get rid of it when you're in the fed State so we don't know the flux we didn't have the video we just had this a bunch of snapshot to the sale of cysteine my guess is that unlike the guy whose homocysteine went down with the b6 this guy he had a recycling issue he did not have a problem of disposing of the homocysteine in the fed state he had a problem of recycling in the fasted State he just couldn't do it and he can do it because MTHFR just didn't work very well and so only when you added the trimethylglycine which is the choline pathway so when you use choline for methylation what you do is you convert it into trimethylglycine and that becomes the methyl donor that's the alternative I mean it makes me wonder now if we just supplemented more choline if we could've got the same result yeah

[02:30:00] I'm sure you could have gotten there the same result the only the only possibility that would prevent that would be if he had a problem with the enzyme that oxidizes choline you trimethylglycine I liked it all comes out - choline we have four chickens at home and my kids named them so they have the funniest names that two of them have pretty normal names there's there's

[02:30:18] Sarah is one of them and bang bang and A Go Go you can almost tell which of my kids named them I feel like Sarah would feel left out yeah yeah exactly so little bang bang and Go Go and Sarah not Kate and I'm embarrassed to admit on the spot I forgot the name of the fourth chicken but it's a totally normal name that's not funny because my daughter named that Sarah and the normal one am i oh my god but now I feel like even more indebted to these little guys I mean

[02:30:47] I've always loved eggs and of course once you eat eggs that are like coming from the chickens that you're feeding the leftover vegetables on your table like the yolks are so yellow the eggs taste so good it's very interesting to see this connection between choline creatine methylation I mean this is complicated stuff and of course the skeptic will take a step back and say well Chris what if you just fixed a bunch of numbers like yeah you can make homeless sistine go down and yeah you can do this and you can do that outside of the naff wildy which there's no disputing if you fix an apple d you've improved a person's life does it matter if homeless cysteine goes down does it matter if you're at six instead of 14 because you've optimized these things I don't think we get it ginger by the way it's Sarah ginger bang bang Go Go Archie yeah I would still feel left out of us there yeah yeah no it's okay so to the skeptic no I don't think the argument is super super strong that by fixing the homocysteine you're reducing cardiovascular risk that's definitely not an airtight argument I look at homocysteine and I say well look young healthy people have a homelessness knee on the average between 7 & 9 that's probably the sweet spot but yeah I mean if I were looking at that from the perspective of what is the least stuff I can do unless I am very compelled by the data to do it then

[02:32:11] I would throw out at least everything that I just said except the choline and depending on how hard of a skeptic I am I probably throw out the choline - and that's because this comes down to a philosophical question of what is the level of evidence that you need to take in action versus the level of evidence to not take an action which people always forget that they have to ask that question just as well well also versus the level of evidence to state that you have a certain degree of certainty or confidence in something so the thing is

[02:32:43] I think that we can be fairly we will debate it but I think we can be fairly rational and within a fairly narrow window on what do we believe are the principles that we need to secure to say we have a certain degree of confidence that something is true but we can never create that window for saying what is the level of evidence that I need in order to take an action because that comes back to your subjective values a lot of this is a assumption as well even if you're coming to the question of what is the probability that we should assess that something is true for me

[02:33:24] I would take as a background that things that have a proven track record in human history over a long period of time should be assumed as a default someone else may take the assumption that nothing is the default or that the status quo is the default so if you're basically saying that we have to have meta analyses of randomized quran demise controlled trials on clinical endpoints in order to have something you are assuming that in the absence of that evidence we will follow the status quo so even in the case of us debating how confident we are that something is true we have reasons like that to have a spectrum of agreement or disagreement but when it comes down to should I take this supplement that comes to like subjective value over what kind of risks do you want to take right so look there are some people that want to optimize their metabolism to make their body run like a well-oiled machine the best way that they know how and they're willing to spend some money or design their diet around doing so and I think most of what I said mostly applies to those people I think for people who are looking for hard clinical endpoints and in fact this is why there's Twitter wars over MTHFR sometimes which is that there really ain't god I miss those so yeah so

[02:34:52] I mean so I've I've gotten into some tussles on the internet with some people who looked at this from the perspective of look there's no hard clinical end points for which MTHFR is diagnostic there's no hard clinical end points for which people with MTHFR for whom that population has some specific dietary or supplemental regimen that alters that clinical endpoint and I think that's true where I come from if I were in that situation I would want to bring my homocysteine down to what by all probability appears to be the healthy level if I were that person I would want a reason well I feel like my mind is too sticky and I want to loosen it up a little bit if I were that person I would want to have good energy and I would want to use a rational assessment of why my energy might be low and what I can do to bring it up to norm and I'm probably never gonna convince anyone that if I feel better that there's a hard testable end point to that let's come back to the NRA I did I was just about to say the one thing I really want to ask you about is in all of this stuff wonder whether it's the increased choline the glycine the creatine I think I get the sense where you on your own personal spectrum of risk fall on those I haven't actually got a sense of where you fall on the NR spectrum personally yeah oh well if it helps clarify I took 75 micrograms of it with breakfast and seventy five micrograms with lunch micrograms milligrams sorry which is still pretty low I mean that's much lower than what's provided in those sup right I got 150 milligram capsules that I broke in half okay so that's much less than what's being provided in basis and true Nyugen right yeah I might go up I'm just playing around with it it's just a tinkering thing with or without a stir to an activator yeah that's the true

[02:36:39] Nige and there's no there's no pterostilbene in it I was studying it a lot so let me take it and see what happens we can I the way to me is one of the most tried-and-true interesting ways to do science is to you have to become a little bit of a self experiment to run this stuff well h pylori yeah everybody loves the point of that exam I will say this anecdotally for the patients of mine who do religiously take one of those two products basis or true najin the one thing that seems to across the board improve and it would be very difficult to attribute this to placebo is patients who have even an inkling of rosacea seem to have a monumental improvement hmm and again I don't know if that has to do with the skin you know we were talking about the skin again but is it sun sensitive rosacea often is but you know I don't I don't I don't know if

[02:37:34] I can say across the board if each of those patients has Roseate no I wouldn't say it's exclusively sun sensitive right so some people their rosacea gets amplified by certain things in their diet you know I have some patients when they eat chocolate it goes off the rails or alcohol or stress or sleep deprivation so no I would say there could be multiple different triggers for it and I remember once even looking it up and finding sort of an old esoteric paper about topical niacin I believe I think it was in the form of niacin that could improve rosacea I said before I think that the skin is one of the areas where I would expect to see fast results and so it's this question of how do you do you pick the right people and design the right study to see an effect like that and so that's interesting maybe a rosacea endpoint in a clinical study would have good results do it yeah but what I'm basically taking away from you is IV and AD is not a great idea just on on the on the principles we've described that does not seem to be the way you want to administer it it's much better to build up and a hepatic reservoir of nicotinamide that's converted through the NR that you can then slow trickle into circulation as needed is probably a better bet yeah I mean I'd be I would consider it fascinating to see studies of what is actually happening physiologically when people inject it but nothing about outside of that granulocyte response which some people take that to mean it's doing great things like look at how shitty I feel this must be doing something right I've always taken that damina I don't know that's why mercury was so successful yeah I mean it makes no physiological sense but yeah I mean a study could prove me wrong but there are no studies and it makes them physiological sense but I want to come back to one little point on the decision-making thing so the nicotinamide right aside video that

[02:39:20] I made it was took an anecdote of someone who posted on my facebook on something else that I was doing and told like a four paragraph story about how she started taking the true niacin and she felt great for a couple weeks but then she started feeling the energy sapping off and then dropping and then she felt felt like going through a mental rollercoaster and I used this anecdote that obviously could have other explanations and clearly has no clinical measurable end point and I got people just came out of the woodwork meaningfully yeah troll it like in the

[02:39:56] YouTube comments YouTube comments should be never read but no but I think listen this I think this is an interesting contrast anecdote so here there are there are people often pointing out that there's no hard data in that story who are saying all kinds of great things about the way they feel when they take a lot of this stuff not realizing they are also not yeah so I think it's irony but it's it also comes back to the point where look people are gonna make a decision to take this or not and there is no clear data on what it does and so you either take the position that you're gonna wait 10 or 20 years until we know something better or you take the position that you're gonna tinker and if you're gonna tinker you're gonna tinker a lot more successfully if you have a working model of what's going on than if you don't yeah I mean I think it comes down to and it would be impossible for me to say I don't subscribe to that ethos because I mean look I take rapamycin for heaven's sakes and if you want to talk about a much bigger hammer

[02:40:57] I mean wrap I would probably be the the single most out-there thing that I do but my models robust now I also think I have much more data to point to so even though people could say well oh my god rapamycin is so scary I get the point to what happens in the yeast the Flies the worms the mice the rats the dogs the kangaroos the Hume you know I mean so I feel like I'm standing on the shoulder of much more evidence even though I'm interfering with a much more important sensor right I'm actually going after the God sensor right like the single most important nutrient sensor in our body but at the same time you know you don't feel anything right like the so what's interesting is if you're taking nicotinamide rai beside for a way you feel it's very confusing because I don't see how one can disentangle the placebo effect I mean I have I think this has become something that has come to the public's consciousness much more I mean even the New York Times wrote a piece on this several months ago which is the power of the placebo effect and I've even spoken with pís who have run studies using psychoactive agents and you'd think how could you plus C bow your way out of that and yet they've told me that the placebo effect in terms of the post depression you would get with certain psychoactives is actually greater in the placebo group treatment group so I just don't know that I trust myself to discriminate between something that works or doesn't work based on how I feel I'd almost prefer to experiment with compounds where I'm just pointing to biochemistry and you know hopefully in time some biochemical proxies of course with rapamycin we don't have a great biochemical proxy we can't measure at otha g we can't count our senescence cells you know we can't look at inflammation within our muscles things that we believe would be improving but i just don't like the idea of having to rely on how I feel so solely I mean yeah look if you feel like crap that's that's that's reason whether it's placebo or not that's reason to stop yeah we're if you feel like crap and then you take something that makes you feel great that's placebo leveraging yeah although again look I mean you could argue that taking heroin will transiently make you feel pretty good too and I said sort of a dumb example because it's so over the top but so Peter Thiel has this great question that he poses in armor if he posed it in the book you know zero to one or a piece certainly talked about this which is what's the important truth that very few people would agree with you on so something that you think is definitively the case or probabilistically very likely to be certain that you would find very few people to agree with you on and this doesn't have to be just limited to what we talked about today this could be put into health and medicine No okay then I think that's easy the thing that I believe strongly about that the largest number would people would think I was crazy for it probably be that twice the libertarian of your libertarian uncle I don't know I think you'd find a lot of people that more and more an hour losing faith in big government and would probably come to your aid on that maybe

[02:44:11] I believe there would be a few hundred yeah you're that extreme in your libertarian views all right well then it's appropriate I've raised this question through the lens of Peter what about within the world of biochemistry medicine etc so I think very it's a very population specific thing so for me I believe certain things in the alternative health sphere that I think

[02:44:33] I'm surround by people that disagree with me on and I spend a lot of time there that other people in the conventional sphere might be think I'm totally right for advice exams oh oh so so as an example in the alternative health sphere it is almost you by the way am I in the alternative health sphere or not I don't know where

[02:44:53] I live probably yeah Wow it's a alternative medicine it doesn't really have a clear definition like the NIH has a norm of alternative medicine but alternative medicine is basically the stuff that's not standard practice and then when it becomes standard practice it's not alternative anymore okay fair enough so by one definition you could kind of encompass everyone who's doing something progressive or on the edge or whatever I mean to the extent we would disagree with that I probably just modify my definition here but so I find myself in the nutrition sphere I find myself among many people who would throw out the RDAs for example so I would say people in nutrition that they're not are DS they're fairly progressive or they're fairly alternative or they're into supplementation or whatever probably think that the RDAs our trash science and I think that the RDAs are actually super good science they're often outdated they're often limited by the fact that if you are a committee who's producing a report that someone else is going to simplify onto a four inch square on the side of the boxes of the cereal that everyone in you know that 300 million Americans are going to just look at the number and make some assumptions about that you have to be a lot more careful about what you say but

[02:46:07] I think that we really throw the baby out with the bathwater if we don't look at what's been done by the people who are hardcore conventionals this is your history coming back to you right your appreciation I mean it's not it's not just history I mean for right now for one of the first things that I did when

[02:46:25] I started researching niacin was I read the DRI report for niacin which was in 1998 there's a lot that you could say to criticize it but I think that wherever you are in controversy that you really have to know the core of what constitutes the conventional belief just look at my Twitter feed over the last few days I'm in an environment where many people are can

[02:46:47] Vince about the carbohydrate hypothesis of obesity and in fact one of the interesting things about me is that I think I found myself very friendly with people in the low-carb community because of things that I think are crazy in the conventional community that we agree on so for example like I think the the history of the dietary guidelines and the demons demonization of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet is completely wrong and I've done a lot on that to the point where I think probably both of us for the amount of eggs that we consume there is a very large number of colleagues of ours who might think that we're crazy and let's take the example of the carbohydrate hypothesis of obesity so I went into graduate school thinking that insulin was the cause of obesity and that you couldn't store fats in adipose tissue unless you had glucose they're available and kind of all these things and also went in thinking that the chain of causality was from metabolic problems to obesity I couldn't figure out why on earth my professor seemed to think that the causal chain was opposite and that obesity was causing metabolic dysfunction I think I've come to really believe that the conventional view of obesity being a cause of metabolic dysfunction is true and that puts me square in the middle of conventional theory on a lot of metrics and because of the environment that I have put myself in with the people that I'm friends with and colleagues with in that particular environment I think it's a truth that a lot of people find me crazy for it yeah it's interesting I mean you have never really thought about where I said I mean you know so my view is that obesity is actually largely a compensatory response for something metabolic so that's the opposite view of you I think if I'm understanding you correctly but it's also hard to neatly fit these views into a box I mean because you're always gonna find a patient that's an exception to your rule but that's a whole separate story there's a lot more I'd like to go into but we have been at this for about three hours so we might just have to do a round to at some point in the interim what is the best place for people to find you I know you're pretty active on social media where how do you like to engage so my website is Chris master

[02:49:13] John PhD com everything I do is posted there I'm on Facebook Twitter Instagram and YouTube are the main places to find me Twitter is a good place your handle is Chris masse at Chris master John on all of this but not Chris Masters on PhD that's only your website yeah I would have made it Chris Masters on comm but when I decided to buy it there was someone who bought it years ago and was selling the domain name for like fifty thousand dollars so I think it is it'll just I'll just add the PhD that's why mine has MD by the way yeah I didn't want to pay for the regular one a lot of the stuff we've talked about this will be some pretty robust show notes because we've got a there's so much stuff to link to as you pointed out so many of these things are not as difficult to I don't want to say easy but they're not as difficult to understand when you can see the diagram sure you've done some really elegant videos on a number of these topics which will link to and you know I just wanna thank you for being here man yeah thank you for having me who's great how was that topo Chico by the way that was your first great you know it tastes it has a slight taste of beer to me interesting yeah I promise I didn't spike it so I'm glad whenever I can give someone their first topo Chico it is it is such a feeling of gratification so I'm really glad thank you so much remember you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye
