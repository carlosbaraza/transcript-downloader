Josh Rabinowitz is a Professor of Chemistry and Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, where his research focuses on developing a quantitative, comprehensive understanding of cellular metabolism through the study of metabolites and their fluxes. In this episode, Josh focuses the discussion on three main topics: metabolomics, NAD (and its precursors), and cancer metabolism. The metabolomics discussion starts with a broad definition of metabolism, metabolites, and fluxomics before diving deep into glucose metabolism, lactate as a fuel, movement of lactate, and the regulation of these substrates. He then gives a detailed explanation of the electron transport chain and Krebs cycle and their implications with respect to both drugs and nutrition while also explaining how NAD is central to the process of energy generation. He then discusses the age-related decline in NAD and what current literature says about efforts to increase NAD through intravenous or oral supplementation with the precursors NMN and NR, including whether doing so provides any advantage to lifespan or healthspan. Finally, Josh ends the conversation talking about cancer metabolism and how one particular intersection between cancer metabolism and immunotherapy might provide a hopeful outlook on the future of cancer treatment.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a deep discussion with Dr. Josh Rabinowitz about metabolism, NAD+, and cancer metabolism. The conversation covers fundamental aspects of cellular metabolism, the electron transport chain, and how cancer cells utilize different metabolic pathways. There's significant focus on NAD+ supplementation and its potential benefits/limitations. The discussion concludes with insights into cancer metabolism, particularly in pancreatic cancer.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- NAD+ levels decline with aging, but only by 10-20%, not as dramatically as sometimes suggested [1:02:15]
- Cancer cells are distinctive glucose users, even when other fuels are available [1:45:30]
- Lactate serves as a universal nutrient that can be used by most cells in the body [0:45:20]
- The electron transport chain converts chemical energy to electrical energy and back to chemical energy [1:15:30]
- Pancreatic cancer is particularly efficient at utilizing nutrients and can function with reduced TCA activity [1:55:40]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Understanding that lactate is not just a waste product but an important fuel source [0:42:30]
- Recognition that metabolic flexibility is important for health [0:55:15]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For cancer patients, combining ketogenic diet with chemotherapy might be more effective than either alone [1:50:20]
- Timing of macronutrient intake may be important for immune system function [2:01:30]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:

Supplements discussed:
- NAD+ precursors (NR and NMN) [1:05:30]
- Oral NAD+ supplements likely break down to niacin in the gut [1:08:45]

Medications mentioned:
- Metformin's effect on complex 1 of electron transport chain [0:58:20]
- Pemetrexed for cancer treatment [1:47:15]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Fasting lactate levels as an indicator of metabolic health [0:52:30]
- FDG PET scan for cancer detection [1:46:15]
- NAD+/NADH ratio measurements [1:00:45]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Metabolism is a system in action, and I think this kind of static view of metabolism which got codified in the textbooks is one that kind of killed metabolism as a topic of excitement" [0:35:20]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the optimal ways to measure NAD+ levels in human tissues?
2. How does fiber intake specifically affect immunotherapy outcomes?
3. What role does the timing of macronutrient intake play in cancer treatment?
4. How can we better understand cellular heterogeneity in NAD+ levels?

This analysis covers the major points discussed in the episode. Would you like me to expand on any particular section?
