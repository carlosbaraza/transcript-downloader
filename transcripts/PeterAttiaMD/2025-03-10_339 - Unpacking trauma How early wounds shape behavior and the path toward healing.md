## Transcript

[00:00:00] talk a little bit about this loaded word of trauma really embracing a definition moments of perceived helplessness you know that's what's going to activate the lyic system what would you say to a person who's listening to us who's trying to even understand if they've experienced trauma learning coping skills in safe offices with therapists it's really hard to recreate that back at home I'm going to day two of my journal here I can't help but feel like it's a mistake to be here how could this place this experience possibly make a meaningful difference in my life trust the process they say surrender to it in quotes I'm told okay I'm here and I guess I'll try this is hard work and this is uncomfortable and if it wasn't there'd be a line of people all the way back up that hill trying to get in here but if you noticed there's there's no line to get in here right you know if someone's listening to us and they're sort of contemplating either dipping their toe in you know by working with a therapist and trying to probe some of these things or if they're thinking about jumping in the lake mhm and then going to a residential place like the bridge um what would you say to them if there's a voice saying it listen if there's a voice even if it's a whisper it's there for a reason and I think more important than anything else you're either going to deal with it or it's going to deal with you hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:39] AA Jeff Peter kind of hard to believe we're sitting here huh yeah it is hard to believe um and it's amazing and it's it's good to see you likewise um I thought long and hard about how I wanted to sort of structure our discussion today um knowing that this was uh um a conversation I've wanted to have for a very long time and you know I think um maybe the easiest way to start is just to kind of talk a little bit about this loaded word of trauma um I you know when I first was introduced to this idea of of trauma I didn't know what it meant and I think today it's become such a catchy buzzword that everybody is traumatized by something and and and I don't know if that represents a pulum swing or a normalization or what but um why don't we just start with with kind of how you describe trauma as a trauma therapist and as someone who's been doing trauma therapy uh for many years not just in the you know in the in the recent trendy years uh for whatever that means but how do you describe this to people well I would have described it the same way that you described it initially you know back in the day you know trauma I you know I have to have been at Vietnam wartime uh n 11 um these are those big T traumas you hear some folks use that type of terminology but within the spirit of the work the knee to knee work um really embracing a definition moments of perceived helplessness okay um so you know that's what's going to activate the lyic system all right so who is to say what one Lim limic system evaluates as helplessness versus another all right so that's when we get into this um I think discovery of most of the people that I meet have been meeting over the last several years are the ones wow like I think I did experience trauma right um you mentioned it's it's a much more popular thing and now are we trending in a different direction so and a lot of my work with clients individually or groups you know how I say I hate to oversimplify things but I think sometimes we just make things too damn complex okay and so you know a lot of what I do is try to depolarize for folks you know and we getting into these situations to where you know we live in this world of get over it it doesn't matter versus like you mentioned perhaps stay stuck in it right so um but yeah moments of perceived helplessness you know activating that lyic system and these things can happen you know sometimes at the bridge you remember we talked about wounding events and one of those would be a tragic event you know life seems to be going one way before this thing happens and then this thing happens and life changes and everything is different on the other side of that right a big T event um versus someone again who maybe you could describe it as a th paper cuts

[00:05:00] M right someone growing up going through childhood daily being limic activated but moments of perceived helplessness that stuck for me and it's stuck for a lot of clients I've written about this in the book which is that you know you and I met at a place called The the bridge to recovery um in December of 2017 seven years ago yeah um and you know that was a very hard chapter for me to write um and one I wrote somewhat reluctantly but also in the end felt I couldn't not write it like so the book was sort of incomplete without that chapter um so maybe we can even frame this discussion around how a place like that comes to exist um and how therapists like you work at places like that um

[00:05:54] I'll throw one idea out that's worth discussing but it's literally one of a hundred which is it might be shocking to some to realize how much group therapy is done at a place like the bridge to recovery um in fact as I looked through my journal which I brought back yeah um looking through the notes it's amazing how complex it was for me to be able to open up in front of a group and how I spent the first few days saying virtually nothing MH largely because of I think that that that discomfort sure so um maybe tell folks a little bit about the bridge the type of work that's that's done there I forget exactly how I described it in the book but I described it as this wonderful horrible place in the woods of Bowling Green Kentucky yeah it's some folks call it a residential treatment some people call it trauma

[00:06:47] Camp there's a lot of different name oh I wrote some other names down here do you want to know what I have I have uh Camp Misery the sadness Factory and the tree of pain those are the names I wrote down and I couldn't argue with with any of those um so what is it um it's it could be described as residential treatment and I would describe it as residential treatment for disconnection okay so when folks think of I think when most folks think of disconnection they get a little like well that's vague okay but when most folks think about residential treatment we tend to jump to substance abuse that's where people go so that they can go away um and get sober okay um and so often times the question would be like well why would somebody go to a place like this that's not an addict when to use that type of terminology well disconnection is just the concept that's used at the bridge and it's a word that describes one way of disconnecting is substance abuse but also screens sex relationships ego anger so you just take away the substance take away the word alcohol and plug in whatever word you want to you mentioned the group process so you might have a group of eight folks and there may be three folks in there that identify as substance abusers and there could be two Workaholics in that room right and so the commonality within the circle is going to be you know you may disconnect differently than I do Peter but the commonality is is that when especially when life throws us a curveball this disconnected version of me seems to come out jump in my driver's seat if you will and that's probably been happening a lot as far as Acuity goes if that's what where how you find yourself at the bridge you they all saying is nobody gets there because it's a slow Monday okay so um and then the big word that you use which I think is um it doesn't matter there's a part of me that wants to say like oh don't give away the secrets so let the magic happen but I also you know going through the program to work there and know that you can know everything that's going to happen and then you start going through the process and discomforts what it's all about right that's when my stuff comes up so that's the whole idea right so when folks you know if you remember admissions day is on a Monday so we would usually meet the groups on by

[00:09:25] Tuesday and countless times I've tried to help talk folks off the ledge of leaving and in summary their reason all of them different details but you know I came to the bridge and my anxiety was at a seven right now I think it's a nine I need to get the heck out of here this place ain't for me you know and sometimes they look at me like I've got you know two heads when I say you know actually you're providing the evidence that this is exactly the type of place for you so yeah that that first day there that

[00:10:01] Monday is um is a very very I mean it's a very unpleasant day I'm sure for everybody I don't I don't think that's a stretch to take my experience and say that that that was unique um the um maybe it's worth kind of explaining again how what what are the objectives of this phase one that you describe from the beginning I would say getting my history straight okay the telling of my life story seems simple several folks many folks have done it before but within and through the lens of what we introduce as far as the traumat Tre that you referred to like it's the what happened to me story and so many of us for so many years sometimes decades have been telling the story of what's wrong with me and so from the very beginning the shift is to the hope is to move a little bit closer to what happened to me right not within the spirit of an excuse but an explanation right like oh wait a second it makes sense that I do this thing now this there was a utility to this

[00:11:13] Behavior right the group process it's just it just brings up the stuff I call them the guards Parts therapist will call them protective Parts but and this isn't new there's new we use termin ology that's new but it's ego States but when I say guard this protective side of Jeff that comes up when he gets vulnerable and when do I get vulnerable typically when I get dropped into a different situation so that first week

[00:11:43] I'm going to live with some new people I'm going to eat with some new people I'm going to share a story share deep information about myself um and and and that's really the objective is to start you know within the technical thing that's happening therapeutically is there's a window of Tolerance that we all don't have right and so we doesn't don't want to drop into week two work when we start doing these experiential therapies right but within the spirit of a window of Tolerance and experiential therapy telling your life story is experiential therapy right the content's important

[00:12:21] Peter but so many times the way the story is told is more important or as important at least as the content of the life story you talked about the trauma tree maybe we can describe the roots and branches of that tree in some detail because that is kind of the meta structure that I think that story gets told it's the cause and effect piece of it at least that's how I sort of came to understand it right um I I've seen many different ways that um trauma is described obviously since I left the bridge i' it's a topic I'm personally very interested in for myself for patients Etc but I'll I say Jeff I always come back to that structure and I think it is the single best one I've seen now that doesn't mean that it is the best one it's just the one that resonates the most with me because causality means so much in my world absolutely and I like the idea that even though it's not a onetoone mapping you know everyone who experiences this trauma will have this manifestation clearly not right but um if you accept a little bit of the um the randomness in the system it's it's pretty powerful so maybe walk people through the uh the five roots and the four branches of the trauma tree the five roots of the trauma tree that's the what happened to me okay so this can be seen through the lens of trauma and and for folks where trauma is just too big of a word like can I'm can you believe I'm saying that on this podcast but okay then lose it right highly stressful events Okay so abuse tends to be the one that we talk really the least about at the bridge because that's the one that folks tend to know the most about that's not to mean that we minimize it there's just so many different forms of abuse physical emotional abject social so you move over from abuse and you look at something like neglect which can be very tricky so many folks that have experienced neglect it's an eye openening experience because while something like abuse is something that happened to me neglect is something that failed to happen for me all right and so to see that through the lens of high stress or pain um so many different way ways one can be neglected um you know an example that's used there is the little boy that is going to school and he's being bullied okay and he's got these parents who are professionals and they're successful and they're busy and they've got the best of intentions but they're missing it they're missing the look on this kid's face when he comes in every day and before he gets on that bus every morning that question is not being asked what's happening and so every day this little person's being required to go to this place where this thing's going to happen and evidently these folks at my house don't have time right and it's important to emphasize I think the word intention because intention is not required right how many times have I said have I heard well they had the best of intentions they tried the it still happened or in the case of neglect it failed to happen Okay in meshman that's a wounding experience where you've got a boundary violation right so that can happen within the

[00:15:59] Spirit of what we call emotional incest where a child is put in an inappro an age inappropriate position maybe the child becomes best friend counselor and Confidant for Mom or Dad um and then you've just got this engulfing and meshman which happens a lot of times in successful families where outcomes and expectations are celebrated and then not so much the journey and so that engulfing and mment can be one of those situations where this is the way to be um more of a me mini me relationship between a parent and a child instead of that iow relationship and so and in those situations with with enmeshment what typically happens is we either drink the Kool-Aid we get on board with it or what do we do we Rebel and I'm not going to do anything that looks anything like this neither of those things is probably who I was meant to develop into yes I think probably in my opinion the umbrella wound or we're talking about the tree the root of the tree would be abandonment okay and physical desertion or abandonment that's loow hanging fruit as far as I think the general public and knowledge yes when somebody leaves now a permanent abandonment obviously someone passes away there's death um there's seasonal folks leave for work military deployment um folks go to prison um parents get separated parents leave come back um now emotional abandonment that's that situation where someone's there but they're really not there you know and this Emotional Self gets denied and and a lot of times when you're emotionally abandoned you know it can be a situation where it's emotionally cut back meaning the house I grew up in we did anger you right that's what we did um wasn't okay to be sad wasn't okay to be scared but we did anger okay um so it wasn't like we were emotion free it was just we were cut back to that one that's the one that

[00:18:13] I saw the most um and then sometimes it's just a situation where it's cut off and it's blank no emotion um and I mentioned already the tragic event route of that trauma tree and so I guess what I mean by the Abandonment for me being this umbrella wound is is when you abuse me you abandon me I keep going to parents because those are the folks that we spend the most of our time with in those formative years but any of these wounds can happen with anybody in our life and they can also happen any time in life it's not limited to

[00:18:51] Childhood when you get something happening when the brain and the body's developing right you get something what I call it gets concrete you know that gets cemented it gets burnt in and what that that thing that I'm talking about getting burnt in is how I adapted all right I mentioned that the question is what happened to me but I believe the most important Discovery is how I adapted okay you talk about that tree and you we're talking about the roots being the wounding experiences and then that top of that tree is the manifestations if you will of the woundedness right this is how I survived okay and so you have codependence you have addictive patterns you have attachment issues and a whole slew of just survival strategies maladaptive survival strategies and as I say that word maladaptive I want to wash my mouth out with soap okay because they are ingenious damage control strategies the way I describe them it's an old friend that served me well and perhaps now it's making life hard and the best example I can give is have a four-year-old boy spending a lot of time in his bedroom playing with the door closed playing loud so that he doesn't have to hear what's going on in the rest of the house and then one particular day he hears his mother in a voice he has never heard before tell his father that she thinks her arm's going to be broken and he has to open the door door when he opens the door he sees his mother up against the refrigerator and her father the boy's father it's got her in a hammer lock arms behind her and the little boy's got to do something right and he's really outgunned cuz let's say dad's 35 and he's four so he starts walking towards them and the first room on the right is the bathroom and he goes into the bathroom and he lifts the lid on the toilet and he FS fakes acts as if he's vomiting and the next thing he hears is do you hear that your son's getting sick and Dad lets mom go now does the boy go back into his bedroom and get out a little journal and write down manipulation and deception are very effective in life probably not but I say he learned a powerful lesson that day about deception and manipulation right it got him out of trouble he got his mom out of trouble that day right an old friend that served him well but perhaps is making life hard cuz you know healthy folks in adult relationships Peter you know they don't dig deception and manipulation right so that's where my old friend can get in my driver's s seat you could say and make life hard for me but a very adaptive skill I would call it a skill some folks would use the language of a character def I'm not against that language I just prefer a skill I really think that's a powerful bucket because um it has enough breadth to include things that don't easily pathologize MH um maybe for the sake of completeness we could just go back and talk about the codependencies addictions and attachment issues um I think everybody's familiar with the terminology but just as within abuse there are things that people people don't quite think everybody thinks of sexual and physical abuse very few people think of emotional abuse or religious abuse those kinds of things so similarly maybe talk through the breadth of what we think of as addiction codependency and attachment disorders yeah codependency it's the spirit of it and it's not my definition it's an old one but um it's the one I prefer it's an outer reach for inner security okay I can't draw that thing from inside of me right I have to get that from something or someone else you let Jeff know he's okay I can be okay but if you're not okay with Jeff it's hard for me to be okay with

[00:23:49] Jeff that's a blanket summary and I think an accurate summary of codependence um and your addictive pattern addictions addictive patterns I mean again these can be substances these can be process right when I talk about the ego States the parts my guards those parts of me that jump in my driver's seat I look at those through the lens of addictive patterns because it's that concept of powerlessness you'll hear folks that are in the programs such as 12 step programs they talk they talk about being powerless to something you know and to um get into the surrender of being powerless well you can just again you can take the word alcohol remove it and replace it with whatever that behavior is it's it's the thing that I do it's not a it's not a bad thing that I can do it sometimes it's the problem is I can't not do it right so again this could be work this could be ambition this could be anger this could be a many things and usually these things they're they're there for a reason right and again we're back to vulnerab vulnerability is the enemy right so the goal of all of these maladaptive coping skills patterns whatever we want to call them is we got to keep Jeff from being vulnerable right we got to keep that little boy that had that situation with his mother in that refrigerator we got we we've had a bad experience with vulnerability so all these parts of me that step in to my driver's seat they've got a goal and they do they do their job in different different ways but the goal is to keep me from being vulnerable attachment Styles you know you get four books you're probably going to get four different numbers of attachment Styles I

[00:25:37] I like Simplicity um you you'll probably hear me say that more than once but Simplicity let's just the three the three most popular right so you've got anxious attachment right it can be clingy clingy it can be Charming you know it can it can can look a lot of different ways but the more of me I give to you the more of you I expect from you that's going to be the best chance to keep this thing going now avoidant attachment right the distance I can be in a relationship and still not give you all of me I can be in with a person but still have distance right and then there's I'm not crazy about it but disorganized attachment which is kind of a mixed bag of you know come here come here come here now get away you know get you close now I need now I need you to get back and you know that's what happens unfortunately with these wounding a lot of these wounding situations the thing that we were created for right belonging connection right often times that gets coupled with fear so that's a powerful thing when you get fear intensity things of that coupled with belonging right and you can have 10 different attachment Styles unhealthy attachment

[00:26:57] Styles if you will um but the commonality the common denominator is going to be the insecurity they may play out differently behaviorally but it's the insecurity right well what does secure attachment look like Jeff well I don't know I don't meet those people right but it exists because those folks have trust and if we go back to the tree I often think that the wounds or the roots that you keep referring to it's really the story of my broken trust right how did my trust get broken and here are all these things that I do ingeniously to handle that right Jeff when when we examine ourselves or we examine you know or witness others where one or more of the branches of the tree

[00:27:45] I.E the manifestations of trauma are present is it your belief that that automatically implies there is at least one tie to a root in other words is there is there a scenario whereby these manifestations exist minus the injuring events I mean I suppose anything's possible but with the folks that I've met cross paths with had the honor to work with therapeutically there's typically always a connection you know and you know it's it gets so tricky because it doesn't really need to be an a plus b equals c it's you know it's the science of of this kind of undo undoes itself so to speak but like when you when you bring this up this question up for me it it brings up a stumbling block that I've witnessed a lot with with clients within the spirit of or before they even become clients and what I'm getting at is is like nothing happened to me I don't think about that why do I need to talk about that right right and that I I honor that as someone's truth right and of course the answer therapeutically within the setting of somewhere like the bridge is well well that okay like I believe you so you won't have any trouble telling your story right it'll be a breeze for you you know so um you got to roll with that resistance um but the example that comes up for me and that's where we get into implicit and explicit memory okay and this is It's a scenario of good example I think is flashbacks right like so you know go back to the example of something where somebody has an image and I think what comes to mind for most folks is an image like I see this thing so then back to this other person who says I don't think about this stuff anymore like I didn't I don't go into the room and think about my dad cheating on my mother like I don't I don't even remember that stuff and often times the answer is sure you do what do you mean well you remember through your anxiety perhaps right right maybe it's not an image maybe it's not a sound maybe it's not a smell but that thing that that discomfort that you're experiencing maybe that's the way you remember it it's something that's coming up for me um and again there's so many case studies if you will but within the spirit of making the implicit explicit um in the example that I just gave um you know how that process works at the bridge so after the group's over in the evenings we have usually have meetings where the folks can experience some type of maybe a 12ep meeting some kind of meeting um and you know it's part of the curriculum if you will and it's uh you know it's it's mandatory and so um we've had clients you know have panic attacks I would qualify some of those as that in these situations and so you know the next day when you're in group trying to unravel something that happened on the previous night you know and we're talking about a client that I've been describing and they're like you know I don't I don't know what you know like I need to obviously I need to see a medical doctor because I like possibly you do well let's try to work in a both end like let's let's unravel this what was going you know well let's think this process you you give up a certain amount of control this client let's say this client had control issues right and so it's one of the things we ask you to do is give up control at the bridge right and so and client client X says yes yes yes that's right so okay so you're sitting here and you know you know there's exits you know the people are in the room you know all the players are here but for some reason you're anxious that your anxiety's building to the point to where you experien or you describ this thing as a panic attack I said right exactly and I don't need to talk about any of this stuff that you guys are talking about I said okay great so but just play along with me who's the most controlling person that you've ever met in your life oh you should have met my grandmother okay well tell me one of the most controlling things your grandmother may have done well you know I lived with her for you know three or four years in my childhood you know there was that deal with you know the basement you know when

[00:32:19] I was in trouble the deal with the basement you know can you say more about that you know I get locked maybe get locked down there how long I don't know it it was dark and I learned how to not think about it you know so back to the implicit with the explicit so I think of about this like files like there just there's this loss of control file in the traumatized brain right does can I prove that a plus b equals c no I can't right there's not going to be anything evidence-based that says that was a situation based on that grandmother's control and abuse in childhood that is why that panic attack happened but it certainly gives us something to look at it's like coordinates on this warboard if you will in therapy wow there's a part of you that really gets activated when you seemingly don't have control and can't leave a situation so and and and and the hope that that can come out of that right like to see someone who could have been described as resistant to the process all of a sudden at least start to like you're doing right now nodding your head mhm I'm going to start thinking about this maybe I'm not buying into it but maybe something did happen to I think that's one of the I mean gosh Jeff I don't even know where to start I think there are so many huge hurdles for for people to get over when they when they at least begin to entertain the idea that this is something they should look at so that's the first one right so the first one is there's something wrong mhm um unfortunately as a species

[00:33:58] I suppose we have so many remarkable layers of protection that we have to be suffering quite a bit to go through this that's I again I go back to some amazing lines in my journal um no one showed up here on a winning streak like I mean could not be I'm not going to name who said that but I bet you can remember who said that I mean could not be more true when I think back to us all sitting there on day one the 12 of us mhm I mean what a collection of losers we were I mean if we're just being honest like we were we were all on the outs we had lost everything and we were there not because we wanted to be but almost because we had no choice MH um how often do you see that and how how often do you see people that somehow manage to show up there on the basis of pure interest iction as opposed to if I don't do this I'm going to lose my family if I don't do this I'm going to lose my job if I don't do this I'm going to lose my life well what you just describe I'll call that answer B is that's the status quo okay that's usually how folks get there right every now and then someone may come in you know maybe maybe I could call it a tourist or whatnot but that doesn't happen much you know it's like like we would say and if you realiz remember how that property is you kind of drive down into it right um and all the things that are Kentucky you see on the way in um and so the we used to we used to play around with this like this is hard work and this is uncomfortable and if it wasn't there'd be a line of people all the way back up that hill trying to get in here but if you noticed there's line there's no line to get in here right and there's also no gate on this place meaning you know you're free to go also so um and you know I think about I use it's just an average seven or eight when

[00:35:59] I think of groups they could be 10 but I use seven and eight and I think about those folks in that room you know and like there's so many different stories and and some just about every group has got somebody in it that's pretty close if not right on surrender you know and surrender within the spirit of my way does not work right I don't know if your way is going to work Jee but I'm willing to try it on for a couple weeks cuz my way does not work now that is a wonderful place to get to to that I believe most people don't meaning most people don't show up there don't get to that type of surrender I spent many decades this may sound familiar in this space right here life's pretty bad and I hear what you're saying but I still think I know what's best for me and I think that's where most of us spend a lot of time but when you get in that Circle see to me that never mattered because if you were there you had a chance you had a chance to get some different perspective right and if you're not there you know I think just about every group that I've worked with has had at least one person in there that's they're out of obligation just to get somebody off their ass right and quite honest with you to do the thing so that they can go back and say I tried your thing and it didn't work right like I've seen that quite a bit but there's still a chance for something to happen right within that group dynamic if you know if I tell somebody they're an I might just be saying that from therapy heel and maybe that's the same thing that their spouse has been telling them okay but if somebody in this circle that's living with you eating with you doing this uncomfortable thing with you if they in some way let you know that they don't dig that thing that you do I.E the thing that makes you maybe an then hm okay so maybe my spouse isn't the only one saying this right now if you like it I love it I tried to retire from force and change on folks but if you examine that that this person is letting me know they don't dig that either now

[00:38:16] I've got a chance to think about doing something different right and to pinpoint the explanation for why it is it's hard for me not to do that right right so it's it it can be so fruitful even with folks there that are have less than what I would call Healthy intentions cuz they do show up there you alluded to control um one of the huge impediment to people I think making the journey to a place like the bridge is that you have to completely seed control so you show up and you hand over your phone and you go to your room which is literally like a room from a camp with a your share in a room with somebody else sleeping on a cot that's not comfortable and there's no luxury and you're sharing bathrooms with a bunch of other people and they rummage through your books and make sure you they they sign off on everything I mean I I I I don't think they I didn't bring any Contraband but I

[00:39:24] I know that there was very limited in what I could bring basically you didn't want anything there that would distract me I don't think I could have brought books about F1 and sports or whatever right so so talk a little bit about the control because that for many people is this that I know many people who have ultimately gone to the bridge and this was the thing that made it almost impossible for them to go and they had to fall to a certain level of pain before they would go and I know other people who who just haven't been able to pull the trigger and I put myself almost in the situation which is I can't go off the grid for two weeks four weeks 6 weeks that's not possible you don't understand the complexity of my life surely knowing that you must have a very strong conviction for why it's required and it's such a real thing too and you know and it's it it's true some folks can't do it you know and we can't box ourselves into a world to where we're talking about all the fruits of residential programs right but this doesn't have to be an either or thing but within the spirit of that residential process that you described so many different ways that I love the titles that you gave the place right but the control it's got vulnerability written all over it I keep going back to that word we're in introducing vulnerability I we don't try to induce suffering okay but distractions you mentioned the word distraction we want to take away as many distractions as possible I don't pretend to know what you need to happen what the Magic's going to be but I know that we got a hell of a lot better chance of it happening if you don't have your phone if you don't have your cigarettes if you don't have all of these things that help you disconnect CU I need you to be present right and for some of us that's the vulnerability is being present where my feet are do you still the one thing you didn't take away that I don't I think if it had been taken I'm not sure

[00:41:16] I could have gone was exercise so I was still able to run at 5:30 in the morning in the woods and and do some push-ups and stuff like that had I not been permitted to do that I might have lost my mind have you guys ever has that ever been questioned that hey for some people exercise is also a bit of a numbing distraction that's an excellent point because each case is different there's no one siiz fits all this brings up to me how many times that clients come to me um when group breaks and everybody's going to the bathroom they come up to me and they're like what do I need to do on breaks or in the evenings like what am I going to do with this downtime and the answer is you know some folks need to get serious so they might want to pick up one of those books on the shelf and read a little bit um in our library you know some people need to get serious and some people need to play ping pong you know what what might look different for you so I did a lot of coloring okay and I did a lot of dot to dot you know you guys had a book of super elaborate dot to dots like a thousand dot puzzles that would actually make beautiful pictures I never thought I could find something like that so interesting but I but I enjoyed it well you know and one might say you had to disconnect and come to the hills of Kentucky to find a space to even discover that or ReDiscover that right but that control thing that is that is such a player for so many it's a human thing it's not just a client thing it's a human thing right it's like everyone I believe wants to have a sense of some a certain sense of control right and most folks who have a hysterical reaction as we say if it's hysterical it's historical to the sense of a lost piece of control you know that's where we get back into there's probably a precipitating event there could be something that needs to be healed here and that's tricky too healing versus integration how can we integrate this trauma this thing that happened right this all these words bring up so much for me but I do want to mention with control because again it it just it's case study and it's and it's everything is so connected to these in my experience to the trauma you know let's take another client for instance we're going to stay on this control um this control topic so let's say this client comes into the group room and this client is getting ready to check in you know how that thing starts like we kind of just like say something to start the day then everything gets quiet until somebody gets nervous enough that can't stand the silence and starts checking in right somebody always does it can you describe what a check-in is because it it is actually a pretty interesting experience and I needed a piece of paper to help me do it because I didn't know what the words were we try to we try to let folks experience or start practicing letting their outside match their inside and that sounds like a simple goal and it is but it's a complex scenario cuz again some of us have paid a price for letting our outside match our inside right and so that's really the spirit of the check-in is to get some practice doing that just kind of rigorously with as much honesty as possible how am I starting this day where am I at right now what's on my heart you know bringing the heart and head together that's kind of how I describe that um some folks you know it's it's very personal and sometimes times it's group dynamics we want to introduce that you know but again it's let's just get honest you know let's get honest because I think that's the beautiful thing about the group and again this scenario where you know if you can't do it with some yaho at the bridge like I hope everybody's

[00:45:13] Facebook friends for the rest of their life but the fact of the matter is you'll never have to see these people again so if you can't get honest with so and so or in front of so and so how can you do it on the couch with the people that are closest to your heart cuz those are the people who end up being if we want to fall back on the trauma word our our biggest trauma trickers are the people that are closest to our heart right so what maybe

[00:45:37] I can build some muscle memory and being vulnerable in a scenario like we've been describing so you know that's the spirit of the checkin and the example that I'm given where this client is in this rocking back and forth like I believe I can take this client's pulse from where I'm sitting at okay so I'm going to suggest that that client checks in first it's kind of my job to notice something like that yeah and so they haven't said a cross word in my experience in the first three or four days of their journey I haven't heard them say the word hell okay and I'm going to flat out here's what you know that was a bunch of last night bunch of nobody told us that we were going to that place I had to sit in

[00:46:26] I had to sit out there I wouldn't go nobody told us anything about that and let's say this client that they one of their calling cards when they approached the bridge was that they're they were really thrilled about you know you mentioned about nobody on a winning streak but one of wins they're not void of wins one of this client's wins let's say is that like their medication management finally like finally was dialed in they finally got their anxiet body medication dialed in right and so you know this thing happened and 18 hours later I'm looking at this person having this response to literally what it was was I didn't write on the board every detail that was going to happen that particular day especially what was going to happen in the evening when you guys went to a 12-step program off site right exactly in in this example so yeah so and this is the type of reaction still 16 hours later okay right now you know in this scenario perhaps I roll the therapy dice if I have the

[00:47:36] Rapport and say something to the effect of well at least the medications are dialed in perhaps there's an uncomfortable silence it's probably 5 seconds but it seems like five minutes right and then maybe in this scenario we all s of relief because this pissed off client smiles and laughs a little and knowing the journey let's say this client a day later tells her story and they tell a story about spending a significant amount of time with a spouse who was controlling and emotionally abusive and the spirit of their relationship sounded kind of like this get in the car you'll know when you get there right so you see where now did this client have backed flashbacks of this but there seems to be a file based on this trauma based on this wounding experience that was able to push through the medication so don't hear me saying medication's going the wrong way but in this example I think it the discovery inspires hope in a situation where there seems to be so little hope and in this scenario that

[00:48:54] I'm making up you you know what's the answer do I just need to go do I do I just keep up in the dosage well that thing happened to me so that must mean we need right so is that the answer so back to this both end of maybe there's something to look at here maybe there's a file I think that's profound actually because you could argue if you simply look at that experience and say I need to up the dose up the dose up the dose I mean at some point you're going to be comatose right and so so in other words there probably is a dose at which there will never be a breakthrough right but then you're also not alive right so maybe we're better off as you said taking this as a gift saying wow the fact that I got hysterical is now going to point me to something historical that I still need to go and resolve maybe there's some work that can be done maybe I do need to be on medication to get stabilized maybe the medication will help me be stabilized enough to build the window of

[00:49:48] Tolerance that I need to do this type of historical work but there's also some work that can be done right we're not just treating symptoms right I'm going to day two of my journal here I can't help but feel like it's a mistake to be here how could this P how could this place this experience possibly make a meaningful difference in my life trust the process they say surrender to it in quotes I'm told okay I'm here and I guess I'll try that was day two um it's it is I I I I didn't Journal until

[00:50:30] I got to the bridge and now it's been you know it's it's a I have Reams and reams of journals that have been filled since um what do you have a sense of how many what what fraction of folks show up there with a journal do you know 20% okay you know and now that number goes up often times the way you just described it and that's finding out something different a different way to do your day right it is an artificial environment one could say um when we're talking about still talking about the bridge and also it's a metaphor for me in real life right and so you know it's not just these therapeutic interventions or what some group member says or what some therapist says like all those things can be powerful but like what are the things that you added to your day you know and how can you take that back with you right doing your day different checking in with which me is in the driver's seat and like Journal journaling is an excellent way to do that or just simply some mindfulness and some meditation and some just like a you know life's busy we don't always have time to do these things but take a minute you know which me in the dver seat that's the question so let's talk about the different versions of the kid okay there's there's the kid that's born the unwounded child right what's the remind me the name of that that child again the inner child inner child that's right okay so inner child some folks will refer to the inner child some folks prefer the original child the original me authentic me but yes and then we have a wounded child that goes through this this experience or these experiences again very important to remind everybody this could be a bunch of little T's none of which look like much um it's it's too easy I think to look at the Big T's and and say like I don't have a big te like or it could be that the the sum of the little T's actually matters more than a big tea in some individuals um and then you have this adaptive childh so the example is that kid who figured out that by being deceptive he could protect his mom and that's that was the right thing to do I mean clearly the right thing to do he should do that all day every day yeah the more time it's done successfully the more power it takes on talk about some other examples of of how these adaptations that occur to to trauma are really valuable and then start to slowly lose their their their their they start to become net negative as opposed to net positive because again I think this to me is the darwinian nature of trauma right like we're such resilient adaptive creatures that um you know like the case of this kid right like it's that's that's that's brilliant that's adaptive that's that's that's great like all the things that we do to not succumb um maybe just share a few other clinical examples so that people get a sense of of how Insidious this can be and why when that kid is 30 and he's in a relationship and he's misbehaving and manipulating his spouse who's not his father it starts to backfire right right and so what it brings up for me so many things but this concept that I prefer that's not going to sound very clinical at all it's grit grit is something that I think we all have I think we're all born with it and you talk about this wounded child these wounding events this something happens and a lot of us out of that our grit gets covered up and so I've met so many people that to survive they did it by submitting okay and so losing their voice becoming compliant right and so to spend decades trying to find their grit while another another human being out of their woundedness may have survived from grit and they live from it they can't not live from it and they live from it from decades and so the question tends to be at what cost you know at what cost when does this thing that what that was there was a utility to when is it enough and and and

[00:55:10] I always fall back on it's not typically the thing that's bad right it's not it's not the fact that I can do it it's the fact that I can't not do it it seems like I can't not do it right that's where that's where that takes me with the utility and when you mention the Big T and the Little T or those thousand paper cuts you know it brings up post-traumatic stress and complex posttraumatic stress in no way do I want to minimize what we um or a lot of us um would describe as um big tea traumas when we talk about those tragic event those one time events but in the spirit of unraveling things and the healing journey and integration as a clinician I would prefer not that this human had to go through that but as far as there's that thing there's the thing we need to work on I know there's several interventions that have been very successful working on that thing versus this other thing that again going back to the example of the child with neglect and every single day going to school knowing for 3 years that he was going to be bullied right and knowing that no one was noticing and so having to develop some something to survive that right living in lyic activation right just think about that and so how many times how many years that muscle memory created of going back to the parts language or of that guard of that adaptive child unraveling something like that is is a whole another ball game right again please don't hear me minimizing Big T trauma but within unraveling and the integration that's you know it's just repetitive in these limic systems you know we only know what we experience right so abject abuse you know I've heard horrible stories you've heard horrible stories but let's take a child that knows that when Mom gets home because of what's happen her ear is going to be held to the burner on the stove abject abuse right let's take another child that knows there are portions laid out on their plate that will be eaten in a certain way in a certain manner at a certain speed and after that meal they will be weighed and their side will be pinched and should things not be as expected there will be a lecture okay who's to say that which one of those humans are more limic activated the one doesn't know the experience of the other right it's helplessness I can't get out of this thing this thing

[00:58:13] I'm getting ready to have to do so again how can I survive it right and how many times does that happen and how many years does that take place and then we get frustrated and we have the shame bug that goes along with it cuz we're back to the what's wrong with me why can I not do this thing like I know this thing's not doing me serving me well now but I just can't not do it right yeah the utility of the behavior how do you differentiate for folks the difference between shame and guilt because for many people when you show up at the bridge there's a component of of something that you've you've done that's wrong right you've hurt people along the way again that's I think part of the hitting rock bottom that gets you there it's not just that you've hurt yourself you've probably injured others now and that's a part of this maladaptive um Behavior that's now kind of spiraling out of just being adaptive so how how do you talk about the difference between guilt and shame and how do you work somebody out of that shames about well guilt about making a mistake mistake shames about being a mistake right you know guilt I did something I made a mistake I did something that I wish I hadn't have done I need to make an apology right there's a way back from that I'm thinking of this classic John

[00:59:41] Bradshaw he's talking about healthy shame versus toxic shame and what when you talk about a difference between guilt and shame we're talking about toxic shame right that there's something flawed this this flawed defec of um core if you will um my identity is there's something wrong with me right uh there's a way back from the guilt shame registers so differently so when we talk about folks being wounded and the shame and that's how the shame gets registered somebody once told me that that my father never had to get sober because he had me and my mother and my sister to carry a shame for him okay so it can be a generational thing and it comes from somewhere else but shame can play out two different ways some of us out when we're living from our shame we live out of superiority right so grandio shame grandiosity I I I control I perfect I judge I criticize um out of my woundedness out of my shame that can be the me that you see on the outside and some folks the other side of that coin of course is inferiority right broken worthless you know I am my pathology why do you think one chooses preferentially one of those I mean I know that my tendency is always more towards grandiosity than inferiority um what what do you think it is in some individuals that steers them one way or the other when they're in that and and by the way I love that these are I don't even say this to be judgmental I just think that this is a really interesting way to OB observe but um uh I know that my when my inner monologue becomes more judgmental that's that's a great yellow light for me right it's like oh look at look at the judgy words the words you're using look at the black and white thinking that permeates every statement that you're making but but again it's it it that that that's just that tends to be the gravitational pull why do why do you think certain people have that that thing you just said is the thing though that I can't not hold focus on like that little conversation that you just had with self now you've done the work you're still doing the work I'm looking at the journal sitting in front of me that's just a portion of the work right but having that voice that you've obviously cultivated that's where the hope is because again to to live in

[01:02:18] Simplicity I say I hate to oversimplify but I don't at the end of the day I got bad news for the folks out there who think that there's going to come a time through my healing that I just never get triggered again especially those of us who have experienced trauma bad news you will be triggered again and this whole integration game is about starting to live a life where I tell stories that go like this I noticed that I was starting to be really judgmental I noticed I was getting triggered I had this little short subtle thought conversation whatever ever that looked like maybe there was something sematic that happened with my body that

[01:02:59] I did but I had this thing that I cultivated this new muscle that gave me enough space to choose my next step when so many of us especially out of our shame out of our trauma have lived a life telling so many stories that go like this I got triggered and then I did this right and that's the reaction versus the response simple goal right right complex process yeah absolutely simple and complex never to be distinguished um there were a bunch of interesting rules at the bridge no minimizing you got to stand up to get your own

[01:03:42] Kleenex tell me again some of the rules and the reasons behind them first thing is trying to create an emotionally safe place right if we can create a space where folks feel like they can let their outside match their inside then we got a chance for the magic to happen right so you know learning a new language like one of those is one of those things is eye statements you know where so many of us want to make statements for the world the we it's a lot easier to address someone's behavior um you know when we're we're tired of this or we're tired of you doing that like how many times a client may come up to me and say something to the effect of when is somebody going to say something to Peter about being 10 minutes late to group you were never right but hear me out here and the answer is I think the appropriate answer is we're wondering the same thing okay because if I say it it weighs about 10 pounds but again within that group process if another peer going through this rigorous Journey with me says it it tends to weigh a little bit more um you know that Kleenex rule you mentioned that it's there's so much that comes out of I don't even know what a box of Kleenex costs nowadays but like I used to say 99 Cents right like so much can come out of that like how hard it is for for some clients not to give somebody a Kleenex right you can have the best of intentions in the world right but out of our woundedness our trauma our shame so many of us the commonality is professional feeling stuffers right like a lot of muscle memory and stuffing emotions especially sadness right and so the very Act of handing someone a

[01:05:36] Kleenex can cut off something that maybe have been 25 years in the making right and there's so much more that can come out of that because you know for the person who's having the emotion like I think about my healing Journey that I'm still on and like out of my codependence like I expected a lot of people to read my mind right I don't ask for what I need but maybe I'm maybe maybe I'm sitting there thinking why the hell isn't somebody giving me a Kleenex can't they see him crying the answer is because you're a grown man you need to ask for them and go get them yourself

[01:06:08] Jeff right but like and and is the person rescuing me from my pain or are they rescuing themselves right um language that feels guilty part of those rules back to the eye statements and learning how to have um I'm not crazy about the word confrontation but like it's group it's group dynamics right so

[01:06:28] I need to let my outside match my inside so how can I tell another human being that I've got issue with this thing that they're doing you know and just to learn how to say I get angry when you check in every day as if you love this place and then on our walks in the afternoon you're making fun of the process and you're making fun of the therapist and you're talking about the sick behaviors you're going to do as soon as you get back home right I didn't grow up in a house where we talked like that when you I feel okay so just it's so it it's so it just feels clumsy just to learn to to again to create some new muscle memory and to to listen to be able to listen to somebody you know we ask for folks to be present that sounds like present and supportive sounds like the easiest rule you could like why would you have to explain that but like it's hard to be present when you're not in the room that's why if you remember we take breaks as a group right we try to take them every hour every 50 minutes but sometimes you know we always encourage the clients if you need to answer the call of nature before then just let us know and we'll you know we'll take a break because it can be also really handy to go and use the restroom when Jane checks in because

[01:07:44] Jane gets underneath my skin every day right and I and brings up something for me that I need to say out loud so the rules are there to create hopeful hopefully the safety so that the magic if you will can happen um and also um to give folks some a chance at some new muscle memory you know and I encourage clients in these scenarios like start it off by acknowledging you're taking a risk I'm getting ready to take a risk Peter I need to say something to you you know um and that's the spirit of the rules and what about minimizing that was a that was a very interesting rule yeah well and I mean minimizing is a it's an ingenious damage control strategy back to the utility of behaviors right like if it wasn't that bad then I don't need to address it right but my behaviors also affect other folks so when I minimize let's say for example a client um you know like it doesn't matter you know like I got abused so what a lot of people get abused you know you get over it it didn't have any effect on me it doesn't have any effect like in another client hopefully using some healthy language when you speak as if child abuse especially physical child abuse doesn't affect the child I feel sad and I feel angry because you've got a right to your own truth but I know how much that abuse affected me you know so um that minimizing again it's very adap captive but also if it didn't matter you know if if none of this stuff matters then then I just am right and I think you've proven the theory something's wrong with me or nothing's wrong with me superiority or inferiority how many folks find themselves in a situation where and I say this because I I definitely had a bit of This Feeling Myself and I can't imagine I was alone where there's almost a Rel an to get better because there's also a belief that yeah I get it like my life's a bit messy right now and I'm you know the my my my my response is spilling out into bad areas but look at all the good like you know I I remember in particular one of the one of the rants I went on was about how much good has come from my trauma um and I I think in telling my life story it was virtually all good it was look at this good thing and this good thing and this good thing and like why you know I mean I we don't want to erase any of this stuff MH and and I and

[01:10:36] I and I suspect you have a number of people who show up and yes they're they're you know it sounds ridiculous because on the one hand there's clearly a bunch of things that are not good but they're sort of like okay but that's a maybe that's a reasonable price to pay in exchange for all this other stuff how do you how do you how do you help people think through that process and what the trade-offs are yeah when you describe that scenario it's like it was it was your fuel right and I'm using the language of Parts when

[01:11:06] I or guards I call them guards these protective Parts these protective adaptive behaviors and I've looked at many of folks in in your example it would be thank God you've got ambition thank God you've got grit thank God you can get angry and you've got a voice like I don't believe I would have met you you if you didn't and I'd say the same thing to somebody who was an alcoholic like like thank thank God you had that then I don't think I would have met you would should you not have had that right but now you know again can we look at this thing and can we just at least look through the lens of is it making life hard an important thing for folks to remember going into am I going to do the work do I need to do the work am I working on a part of me is that these guards these protective parts of self we are not necessarily trying to retire them and that's what happens I think to a lot of folks is is that part of them there's almost a fear of like how do I exist Does that mean that ambitious at times perfectionist Peter has to go away right think of think of folks who go through life out of their woundedness that um we might describe as they're always waiting for the other shoe to drop right I mean I can think of clients multiple clients who have said it's not if it's going to drop it's when and how loud right like so they are really good detailed at finding negativity at finding danger find and they'd be a hell of a good person to have Along on a walk in a bad side of town right like I'm sure if they were a building inspector they'd be the best damn one out there okay but can you not do that thing when you go home and sit on your couch right that's that's the spirit of and and and back to the process and and the vulnerability the vulnerability can get brought up so many different ways we keep talking about this group process that that you experience there's so many different ways but the common denominator is the vulnerability is what triggers this protective side this protective Behavior to step in and when that happens we can work on it in real real time should that person be in at least consideration of doing something different I every time I see you reading your Journal I think to myself what must that be like it's surreal actually um I'm I'm looking at a note this must have been about day four day no this is day five so we we went to 12 step meetings every night M and I found it very difficult and awkward MH I was I didn't understand why we were doing it why was I don't have a drinking problem why I'm at an AA meeting MH I don't have a sex addiction problem why am at an essay meeting I don't have a drug problem why I'm at the Narcotics

[01:14:14] Anonymous meeting like it just kept we just kept going from one to the next to the next to the next mhm but I wrote something here said the essay meeting last night was amazing three men shared painful shameful stories one of them said that he was getting I can't even read my handwriting some something his wife said things about him and his kids he was basically he was he was losing his family right he was losing his wife he was losing his kids and he was so upset but his his sponsor told him that he had no right to complain about how his wife feels I found that very powerful f um and it was like he was taking responsibility for his action and this was interesting because I remember walking into that meeting kind of thinking good Lord another one of these meetings like how many of these things do I have to sit through and yet and I think it's people have to remember too like we're doing these meetings in a part of town where you're you're seeing people on the wrong side of the tracks like you are not looking at the affluent part of Society showing up to these meetings mhm um you're really seeing people who are hurting Beyond just this is you know my dirty little secret mhm um how many people have the same reaction I do initially which is I'm not a fill-in-the blank addict why do you keep making me go to these meetings every night by the way I've already done 12 hours of group therapy can't I just go to sleep yeah just about 100% of the folks who survival strategy is not substances um as far as that type of reaction what am I going to do during the 12-step meeting well you're going to hopefully sit there and get something out of it you're just going to take alcohol and put in caretaking put in control F fill in the blank with your word yeah um you know helping folks wrap their brain around they're having they're compulse they're having a area of powerlessness you know it's not always is well received at first you know um for example uh let's say that um a client's there because uh he's married let's say he's married to an addict okay why wife's an addict okay so he's considering the same thing you know why do I got to you know she's the addict or whatever um and so within the spirit of sharing maybe not in the group maybe it was overheard but anyway the information comes out that this husband um talking about his teenage daughter and going through the laundry found birth controls so discovers that teenage daughter is on birth controls um and so the first words that come out of his mouth what are what if the people at church find out and so you know when you can in some way try to help someone use a different lens you know one would say and I would say this you know one might say that you're no less powerless to your image management than your wife is to alcohol right because you can't get into coup's therapy you're not going to you're not going to not go to church on

[01:17:48] Wednesday night and tell the people that you're married to an alcoholic right so the area of powerlessness is image management so back to that meeting you know you're just going to you're going to fill in image Management in that blank where everybody else or some of those people have got alcohol and some of those people have got cocaine and again to tell someone that they've got an area of powerlessness or to suggest it it's not it's not always received well initially but it can be an aha eventually an aha moment so if I recall

[01:18:20] Jeff the end of week one was when we do our story right kind depending on where you were in the order but yet T tends to be the last few days of week one talk about what the instruction set was for how for each of us as we went off and prepared to do that well the guidelines that we would typically give folks again was just you know we all we always suggest that the clients you know write something out bullet point it um and we ask that the story be told within the framework of the trauma so these stories don't need to be void of success and great moments and if it wasn't for my grandfather and that stuff but I you know there's a thing we're here to focus on as well right so the what happened to me um and that we' be given them 45 minutes to um tell your story and we try to stay out of the way as much as possible okay unless it's therapeutically necessary you know some folks you know um not rescue would be the wrong word but some folks need to can get to going down the rabbit hole of disregulation with their emotions and going into detail so that client may need a little help moving forward right whereas another client May machine gun through a story right and that's ingenious too right don't have to F it if I don't stop and we might need to slow that client down right um but the essence of the story again is just to tell the what happened to me and then I think where the real magic can happen is during the feedback because you get 45 minutes to use your mouth and then we ask you to use your ears and we ask folks to play by one more Rule and that is please do not give feedback to the feedback right and we're back to the control word right because I've got this thing I'm ready to present and perhaps

[01:20:29] I've presented it 10 times and I've got it written out or I've at least got bullet points so I feel good about no problem but you start telling me how you felt and what came up for you Peter when I was talking about my dad and what he did I don't know how that's going to feel for me right and so in so many times Almost 100% of the time within the spirit of not giving feedback to feedback is feedback is almost like equates to

[01:21:06] I'm going to throw some love on you okay like maybe I didn't have anything in the world in common with you but when you talked about that thing at 8 years old I felt myself getting angry and that's how somebody lets somebody know I was listening to you I was there with you right and 90% of the time at least when and it's so hard for folks to not give to just sit there and let somebody share from the heart and to not give feedback to that feedback right and but so many times it's like well but my brother had it my brother had it a lot worse it just and it's like I just throw my hands down and I'm like it happens almost that's why we do it it's like somebody throws some love on you and it's almost like out of my shame and my woundedness I need to remind you that I'm a piece of it happen so often so we're just like you get to you get to talk how do you break that cycle it's very very difficult a lot of folks they think that change is about announcing what that they they know what they're about to do right I know this is going to sound codependent all right well if you're firing on all Pistons as a therapist the response should be then don't say it right because there's enough muscle memory there we need to practice the uncomfortable thing of not saying the thing you've been saying for years not doing the same I'm the last person to be black and white about many things I think much of my work with clients individually in groups what have you with human beings is finding the gray right and but I tell you what when it comes to

[01:22:44] Compulsive behaviors complex post-traumatic stress these things that we've been doing for years and decades um you're either I'm either strengthening an old connection or I'm building a new one you know and so that's back to the when those clients say what should I do when I leave this group room do something different and experience what it's like to do something different and so many times it's not doing something right I mean we've took the vacuum cleaner away from clients before I mean it's an ingenious damage control strategy it's a safety I mean it's like it's written on over the walls you know we're here to talk about some deep stuff and and I'm finally going to be expected to talk about my stuff right so and we we've encouraged other clients to break rules some folks at the bridge you know might not like that but it's like you need to go on there you need to go take some coffee into the morning meeting you've been a rule follower your whole life yeah we were only allowed one coffee a day or something right yeah that's not much from what I understand it's not the strongest coffee in the world either

[01:23:57] um you do a lot of work now with clients individually as well MH um I I wonder how that is different you know I I've obviously um I've um recommended a number of people go to the bridge I've recommended a number of people go to PCS a place I went to three years later and taking together those two places changed my life um and one of the things I've said when people ask me yeah but Peter it's just such a huge commitment do I really need to do it uh I don't I don't know the answer to that question I'd love to hear your thoughts but what I do say is for me in the state that I was in it could not have been done any other way I had to have immersion MH um and I say I suppose it's not unlike learning a new language where if I decide I want to learn Portuguese mhm and I'm willing to take lessons 2 hours a week I'll get there but if I move to Brazil MH and no one speaks English to me for a month I think I'm going to get there a lot faster and it's not just the sum of the hours there's something acreative about the total and utter immersion literally in the experience that changes it so how do you think about the difference between the work you do and have done at the bridge which is indeed what we're talking about here this this immersive residential type of treatment versus someone who's listening to us that says I I hear everything you guys are saying I just don't I can't do that I can't go there yet is there something in between can I start by working with Jeff just an hour or two a week what how do how does your work with clients differ and how do you help somebody decide maybe I'll start with this question how would you give somebody the the way to think about whether or not they could find some success in individual therapy versus whether or not it it it's really just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic you got to go hardcore yeah so the answer would be yes to the to the can I do this or can I do that yes because it's not a linear path okay okay and whatever whatever it takes whatever works right so I know that before I started doing this gig before I found the bridge I know that I never thought about doing anything residential when it came to mental health and being a professional being a therapist um and then all of a sudden I couldn't imagine doing it any other way you know and I couldn't imagine doing it without the group process because all those things that I'm talking about there's so so so much ACC access to vulnerability and and all of that but let's not box oursel in right cuz some folks it's their truth some folks they can't they just can't go do something like that and so the way that it's changed the way that I approach the individual Dynamic the individual therapy um efficiency right not a rush but I think that through all of the years and all of the clim within the group process and how how I see that works and to be able to somehow synthesize that into my individual assessments and the way that I can work with clients to that Discovery process doesn't have to be as long as sometimes it plays out to be right so within the spirit of the individual process it's like we may reach a point to where it's like you know and here's the next level you know here's the but the same could be said on the opposite side of that coin somebody might be like

[01:28:02] I'm going to a residential program right and then they find out all this stuff and we can take that and integrate that into the individual therapy so but I I practicing individually would have looked so different 10 years ago because of how the trauma and the UN it's it's something that that that it it's no one size fits all and so to think that this intervention needs to be used because it's my specialty or this has to happen or this is exactly how long it takes for someone to have a window of Tolerance like every human being is different um and I haven't seen everything because every Tuesday at the bridge will remind you of that okay but

[01:28:48] I've seen a lot right and so my hope is that most people that I that I meet or I have I have met so many people and continue to meet them that are you've described so you've described them when you talk about folks like I've got a lot like if you want to call it high functioning like I've got a lot right but there's something missing now they won't all say that initially but that tends to be the truth there's still something missing there's a hole there something's just not right and so so why are they with you why are they with me meaning what from their end from their standpoint why are they seeking therapy if it seems all right well it could be because they've just discovered they've just been exposed to something that happened to let them know maybe not often times that client that I just described may have got to see me to get somebody body off their back okay like you need to go do some work you need to go get some help you need to get to go help so that's you know and then it becomes pretty evident whether the person's there for that reason or for something a little more authentic and for self you know I think part of my paperwork should also include

[01:30:11] Jeff English cannot fit a square peg into a round hole right which oftentimes translates into I can't change somebody else's behavior in your life that's a lot that you see that a lot too right but like this person that has finally gotten to a point to where they have been willing to go talk to somebody right and so that is so often those are the people that I'm seeing one of the things about the bridge that I assume it's still true but it it was remarkable to me was that everybody who worked there had been a client there is that still the case outside of some staff members certainly all of the clinicians um most of the staff members and that is um I can't imagine being a clinician there or working there without having done that and that honestly has been the reason why some folks um won't work at the bridge right so we don't operate from therapy Hill right so I'm I'm in my own Journey too I've got my challenges as well yes and so to know um I'm going to have to do some work right right and then to wrap your brain around you know these are the people I'm going to work with right but when to be able to look at a client like yourself and say I'm not going to I'm literally not going to ask you to do anything that I haven't done and to be able to say that from the heart yeah that's that's that's really an amazing feature and and I I sort of imagine that through the lens of anyone who takes care of another person right it's sort of like you know people I think are right to to sort of be frustrated when they have a doctor who's asking them to take care of themselves when the doctor clearly doesn't take care of themsel right like how how is it that you can tell me that I need to eat better and exercise when looking at you it's clear you're not doing those things right right it's it's it doesn't mean that the advice is incorrect or that you shouldn't listen to it right it's just you're asking me to do something you won't do right right whereas yeah at the bridge you know we we can talk about some of the other things that are very difficult to do there such as in the second week when you're kind of beating the out of things uh uh that those are not easy things to do um but to know that you're you know when Jeff and Julie are asking you to do it they did it yeah absolutely and if you think the to the way the journey starts you know is we disclose you know and some professionals be like you don't be careful with self-disclosure you know and it's not about me it's about them but like Hey we're going to ask you all pretty quickly to start showing us a piece of your soul so to speak right so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about mine and that's that hopefully we can start building that Rapport early like I think we can trust these folks right I think that we can I think I think that they can lead us maybe not everybody but like just to introduce that because like you say in week two we ask folks to go places with us right and you know it's you know that experiential therapy and you mentioned one way of doing experiential therapy the sematic part of what we do but you know things have come a long way and um within the the spirit of that process and when you talked about that learning a language I love that analogy you know because you are immersed in that but you know it's it's that being able to experience the emotion right the hijacking if you will of the emotional brain I liken it to we're going to walk you down to the edge of the river okay and and we're going to put your foot into the water now the water being here your past your pain right because we want you to feel a little bit of the temperature right but we're going to stand here right beside of you and our job is to keep you in 2024 25 what whatever year right like we keep you here we're going to go there but we're going to stay here do where awareness right that's the integrative part right some people need to yell because they haven't had a voice some people need to know need to learn that they yelled and they were able to not get lost in it right and everybody's Journey being different and and and befriending but that you know it's it's almost like some people say well I can't put my finger on what it was but I just something was different right and he's like what did what happened what is what is it that you did

[01:34:56] I said well sometimes you might say we were activating your lmic system so that you could do something different while activated right like learning how to get space from the emotional brain so many clients especially clients with trauma years frustr of frustration learning coping skills in safe offices with therapists and they're done beautifully and repetitively within that environment but it's really hard to recreate that back at home right or at work y when triggered right my coping skills live in a part of the brain that gets hijacked when the emotional brain takes over okay and this doesn't always have to be about trauma can you believe I'm saying that but the example I give because I'm a professional right my mother's 87 years old with dementia she's living in a nursing home okay now so all the things that go along with that the irrationality that's involved with that and so Jeff goes to these visits and he starts noticing that all these visits are starting with my mother talking about how somebody is stealing her blue ink pens and what I call her old lady blue jeans right and so I'm sitting there saying are you kidding me like are who would want your blue ink pens right think about this rashley mom who wants these old blue jeans and how many of my visits that's how that visit started and it just went downhill from there and to literally be sitting in the truck outside before a visit pring give me give me what needs to happen here and so many times in as clinicians we ask clinicians take your take your hat off take your therapist hat off right but sometimes you need to put it on because

[01:37:05] Jeff the clinician is not sitting there in front of his mother there's a son sitting there in front of his mother who is facing the reality that it's not his mother anymore and that's very sad right and so the anger is much more comfortable place to be or frustration so I'm going to argue with mom about how irrational this thought is right but it's breaking because I don't want my mom to think that people are stealing her blue ink pens I want her to change I want to this to be corrected right but I'm forgetting like one of the golden runes uh rules excuse me of change when it comes to therapy and rolling with resistance okay the more that I fight for change the more this other person is going to fight for the status quo it happens 99% of the time okay but when you sell crazy back to somebody tenfold they start to suggest rationale rationality here's what I mean by that one day in that truck I realized

[01:38:16] I have got to do something different right so I'm going to go in there and when I went in there I went in there in my with my executive functioning I went in there from the prefrontal cortex right and so when Mom started talking about her blue jeans and her blue ink pens my response was you know what you're right and I think I know exactly the lady that's doing it I'm gonna go give her a piece of my mind and what did my mom say Jeff sit down be sensible right I didn't have access to something that I do all the time with clients right selling crazy back to him right you just yeah you you go home you'll get your cigarettes back if you're talking about the bridge you'll you'll you'll get your cigarettes back you'll get your phone back you'll go back home you'll go back to your perfect girlfriend and life will be okay and no

[01:39:04] I didn't say life's okay all right well then we got something to talk about right you got to stay here you're going to die if you don't change they just fight they just fight fight for the status quo right so but that's that that Jeff that I was talking about I didn't have access to those skills cuz that was I wasn't being driven by now there's all the baggage there's the be in the sun there's the trauma related Dem mom there's all of that that played into that but to be able to get access to the what some folks call the bill paying brain what year were you a client at the bridge 2016 okay so only a year before me so you'd been a therapist obviously for many years before how did you find the bridge so it was it was an email that I probably wouldn't have read and I it was an opening and a mentor of mine um sent me an email and said I think I know you

[01:40:04] I know your story I know your background I think you I think you ought to check this place out and you know and to grow up somewhere like that Bowling Green Kentucky and to not know this place that's existed now for 50 years it's it says something um and and again I had I had a certain mind mindset about what residential therapy would look like and residential treatment and um yeah so I was just blown away and and privileged to be able to do the work I mean it's a gift I talk about folks not wanting to do it and sometimes that being the reason that they won't um join the team there that's a very true thing and and you know I wasn't crazy about doing it either right like I knew there was stuff that I was still working on and will still be working on and it was to be very vulnerable because I'm almost in one way I was like I'm almost interviewing you know like this is an audition you want you want to know I'm my crazy and they're like yes we do what is it that attracted you to this field you know I've done a lot of different things um sales marketing I used to build I used fencing people would say oh really like think they think jousting

[01:41:17] I'm like no like wooden chain link fences yeah let's not take the Glamour and go too far with that um but you know I did undergraduate in Psychology um and then there was that Gap in between me determining and realizing that you know this is what I need this is what I need to do um and you know it's it's just that it the self-discovery part for me it was like starting to do my own work and then realizing that you know to see someone get a taste of

[01:41:56] Hope right to see somebody get a taste of Hope and and and to be part of that you know I think when when I tell clients you know it's like you've got it in you you know maybe I can create a space where it can come out you know and it's it's a privilege you know it's it's a I don't take it lightly what I do and what and what clients trust me with you know yeah I I I I I think you have a a really special talent for it Jeff and I

[01:42:26] I just wonder is that something that only comes because you've experience the pain as well does does someone have to have necessarily been through this journey to be able to guide someone through it do you think that's necessary I don't think it's necessary but it sure as hell helps um I'll say that um the the depth of the connection with the heart in the work cuz it's one thing to say you know my profession the professional I've got purpose right like I I could say I do something that matters right but does that thing matter to me right and it does and and and just me personally I think the weight of that purpose is from the pain in addition to the Hope um having that type of impact to where I feel I heal a little bit each time I help somebody integrate their trauma um and I've had some amazing things happen in the group room um I'm human you know like there certain things that I've done in the group room where I'm not I don't need to be doing my therapy while I'm leading a group but certain things that

[01:43:47] I would do on like an art therapy or something I use the same scene on the board that I use time after time because again that's something that I've tried to unpack and process and I don't need to be doing anything new while I'm and then to be sitting there because of something that happened in the group room or maybe it's where I had and realize that I look at that scene that I just drew on the board differently you know um and it's also um it's also it's personal you know we trauma and we talk about how it's shame like it's something that's touched my family um unfortunately um there's not much of that family left and so um yeah um my sister passed away in 2014 um and she uh she grew up in the same house that I did and so um yeah peace of my peace of my heart's connected um because it doesn't have to go that way you alluded earlier to to sort of the generational nature of trauma um Terry real has has written about this in in some in in some of the most eloquent ways I've I've seen and I think that for some people that can be the motivation to to change once they realize that there's a pattern and and that it's not linear right CU if you if you if you have a belief that it's linear then it's really easy to say well

[01:45:12] I've already stopped it so for example if your your parents were alcoholics um and you're not right well I mean the story's over I don't need any help regardless of whatever other behaviors I'm manifesting and um but if a person can accept that no that's not how it works right there there could be you know this type of trauma in generation G minus 2 that manifested as a different trauma in

[01:45:41] G minus one right and now here in g0 where you are you have this blind spot to what's going on um I know that for me that was among the most powerful motivations to stop the cycle as as Terry described it right and um how much do you think that that factors into to to people's willingness to kind of endure the the challenges and discomfort of the journey I think it often times it becomes pivotal in willingness and in that surrender game that I mentioned um because

[01:46:23] I think as a parent you know one of my jobs or the most important job is in my opinion that my children go to bed and wake up safe right that they don't they don't grow up in fear right and I have a lot to do with that right but like the analogy you know like they tell you on the airplanes about your oxygen mask right like you got to have yours on first right and and and and that you know at at the end of the day being a parent has made you mentioned about why

[01:47:03] I do what I do and what I get out of it and what not and and to to know my clients on a on a different level because doing the work is hard and like you know sometimes at the end of the day when you need to have that hard discussion with somebody when a boundary needs to be set you know when conflict solution in a relationship needs to happen some days you know when when people finally go to bed in the house is quiet you just don't you just want to watch Netflix right and you just you know and so to understand like you just and and but what happens and what can happen is is that you you put off these things and things start to build and they build and they build and then when the levey breaks I'm the worst version of Jeff right if I let that happen right then what about that generation you know what about that next generation and and it's it's responsibility on a whole different level but a gift too you mentioned like yeah a misconception you were describing of well at least I don't drink at least I'm not an alcoholic so that means that I'm not as bad as my parents and there's no work to be done right because there's so many other ways that I can have an unhealthy impact on that next Generation right but to just to be in that place of okay like this is it this is it and and and I have the opportunity like to change this thing in my case reverse the cycle yeah and I think that you must encounter a lot of people who have these socially acceptable maladaptive behaviors and in many ways it makes it even more difficult to reconcile because Society is externally sort of patting you on the back for your workaholism your perfectionism um you know your achievements and all of those things um and and I don't know I don't know is one pattern in your view harder to address than the other or is it all about the individual in other words if you if you think about the individual characteristics the man estation of the trauma and the nature of the injuries those are three kind of things that are all Blended M do you do you try to disentangle those when you're working with people and and and look and pattern recognize or do you just say NOP I literally every person's a clean slate and we're we're just trying to figure out how those three things fit together that's a place I try to operate from out of I think my Humanity our Humanity as clinicians we create there's client files M and you know I've I've seen this we've seen this one before right and sometimes it needs to be said out loud some people need to hear you know I've seen you're not you know I've seen you before right yeah um not always appreciated but sometimes it lands right but um so yeah it's funny I I for me that's a very calming message actually okay the you know what Peter you're not unique here like there's a there are lots of people like you out here it's really easy to think you're the only one mhm yeah and amazing to wrap your brain maybe around the fact that that's actually calming it's nice to know yeah um so that's just you know there's certain interventions that tend to go along with certain you know personalities or certain uh maladaptive behaviors if you will um but yeah God to the best of the my ability Clean Slate you know like what is what what is this person telling me what how they're telling me you know

[01:50:53] Jeff when you think about examples um I've you know I've seen examples where this it seems like everything we're talking about has been taken too far okay right so you you you know there's a story I read about a a teacher who started every day with her school children basically trying to get them each to talk about what was making them sad and you know the story digress so much in that you know one kid would say well I'm sad about the fact that something happened and it was a legit imate you know it sounded actually quite quite traumatic in that kid's life you know they were getting yelled at all the time at home or you know locked in a room and but it sort of derailed the ability to do anything right this is a you know a group of kindergarten kids that ought to be like learning how to write and and you know color and stuff like that and it was you know everything was being pathologized for them so so what do you say to the person listening to us that says we've gone too far and I get it I'm sure that some of the people that Jeff works with who have genuinely been abused um deserve to be there but aren't we just coddling people too much and don't people just need to sort of just bucker up I mean isn't this what makes us who we are yes and no yeah so and I'm I'm certain that those things are happening I would not be um comfortable you know painting a broad brush and saying yes we are too far you know again I'm back to depolarizing things right so most of my folks that I meet through the therapeutic work again grew up in much more of the get over it right buck up right and so and then the other end of this Continuum if you will is everything is trauma right and so let's not box ourselves in you know I worry about the example that you just give there because I'm just thinking about kids in general especially younger kids and some kids can be mean right and so like do I want you know like is that the space for that you know emotions like yes it can be so powerful I believe for children to learn about their emotions right but you know to be guided by them that's a tricky statement like so I I I would hope the spirit of guiding is learning what the behaviors are learning when the time and place for emotion attention is in the time and place that it's not for right so um again my experience comes from individuals typically who are from the far other end of that what would you say to a person who's listening to us who's trying to even understand if they've experienced trauma which sounds like a dumb thing to say but let me let me give an example right so you have a person who's listening M who's either introspective enough to realize that there's some some of some of those things we described as the four branches of the traumat Tre whether it be codependency attachment disorders some sort of maladaptive Behavior Etc addiction maybe they're like okay I mean if I'm being brutally honest I'm not flying on you know a perfect level right like yeah and my you know my my spouse has complained about X Y and Z and uh there does seem to be a little bit of you know interpersonal uh discontent in in this nature in this relationship Etc okay fine and then they if they're again in a particularly charitable mood they look at the kind of five roots of the tree and they're like well okay yeah I mean these sort of things happened but they can't make the leap to say but does any of that stuff actually rise to the level of of quote unquote trauma even little tea trauma like is the answer just that

[01:54:50] I need to get my ACT to together and drink a little less and you know just try to be more present with my kids or you know whatever whatever it doesn't matter what the what the fix is but but they're just not sure that going back and stirring the pot of what happened to them during the first 10 years of their life is going to be an exercise worth engaging in how would you help that person decide that you know you're right it's probably not worth stirring that up let's just work on some behavioral tools right now to you know address the behavior versus actually I don't think you're ever going to truly fix these things until you go back to the root I think that's a perfect way to approach it so let's try that you just in your example like maybe I should just do this less and do this more all these behaviors let's try that let's put together a plan goal setting okay um this is you know I'm coaching you we're not doing an intervention here therapeutic intervention and then we and and and if it happens it happens right but folks who realize or already know that they have trauma or have been wounded significantly sometimes I think the word just trips Folks up and they just can't get over the word right wounded right survivors whatever we want to call these folks they have a really hard time putting knowing into action right like I spent many years as a very well-informed prisoner right like I know all this stuff about why it is I do the things that I do but it's the putting it into action the thing that you did said about the not doing that's where we get to realize hopefully admit to self if that's the fact when I come back to see

[01:56:47] Jeff or whoever well the goal is still failing for some reason I just can't do that right okay well perhaps there's something significant connected to this maybe something needs to be integrated the part of you that is unwilling to do this thing that you say is the goal and the plan when you sit in front of me that's who we need to work with so how do you begin to do that integration right so you know let's go back to the example you gave because it's so profound and and and um probably tragic where that four-year-old boy that learned how to manipulate and deceive to protect his mom has now carried that behavior into his marriage mhm so Step One is is is obviously getting to the point where we we uncover that story and make the connection which was um you know an inner child is wounded that inner child adapted with a strategy was very positive MH everything about that strategy made sense but guess what your dad isn't kind of hurting your mom anymore cuz luckily she got a divorce and he's gone and you're now applying that same behavior pattern in relationships that have nothing to do with the relationship in which that was developed to be protective right and he says okay I I get it Jeff how do I change like what are the next steps how do I go from the understanding of that to creating a new pattern of behavior because this is this is really wired yeah these these paths are heavily heavily melinated at this point so in general what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to expand your window of Tolerance if you will to vulnerability right because typically that protective Behavior again the enemy is vulnerability and so to create some muscle memory doing something different when Bon able not doing that same thing okay and the like when you talked about your experience at the bridge and you talked about what it would have been like if we had have taken away exercise okay like simply sitting still for some folks is a very vulnerable experience right and so to create an environment where that person can experience the discomfort and that's why I think that um within my work and a lot of professionals looking at individuals from a part's perspective right there's different systems different theories internal family system structural dissociation but this language that I'm using it's it's not necessarily new because it's like you're talking about this original self this wounded self this adapted self right the adapted self tends to have some really Hardline beliefs right safety equals control safety equals distance safety equals self-abandonment safety equals somebody else right and as long as that part of self right has that core belief I believe it's going to be damn near impossible to do those things that

[02:00:14] I know I should do right so to know that there are interventions that will will fit that process within do you want the first question is do you got issue with this right because I'm back to if you like it I love it right like when when a when a client is talking about you know they're at the bridge and they're there because um their spouse you know their spouse is going to leave them their spouse is finally fed up with it and you know they've got all these opinions about it so here I am because they said I needed to go to a place like like this and you know and you're like you know it doesn't sound like you got a problem at all what do you mean I was like it just sounds like you can keep being you you just got somebody telling you now that they're not going to deal with it right so and maybe it's the biggest controlling jerk in the world right so all you need to do is go find another doormat you know I'm just hearing you say your spouse is not so you decide whether there's a problem there or not right and so this Behavior again that's become the problematic

[02:01:26] Behavior how difficult it is to unravel and stop doing that behavior again tied into the trauma tied into it being an ingenious damage control strategy at a time in life perhaps and perhaps done multiple times successfully right so you know there's a part of self that says why not do this we've been doing pretty well like this for a long time there tend to be these moments along this journey where I assume I'm not unique in this where people have really significant breakthroughs in beliefs um and it's mostly that a belief gets shattered yeah um I again this is I think one of the real um joys of having a journal is you can kind of go back and read what that was like M and and and read you know on this day like through this exercise this really profound thing happened I mean I wrote about two of them in in in that last chapter of my book I wrote about one at the bridge and one about PCS that were undoubtedly the two biggest breakthroughs in beliefs

[02:02:41] I've ever had in my life they've had a far greater impact on anything in my world and they both happen in an instant right like they both they were huge step function changes in a radical belief system and what I find interesting about it is how much easier it became to make any change after the fact I never want to represent that I'm

[02:03:09] I'm better we're all in recovery here but when I think about the December 2017 um April of 2020 or maybe it was by this point May of 2020 those particular days when those things happen mhm I mean literally within an instant some I I don't understand I don't understand the neurobiology of how it happens but something really switches and I never look at the world the same way I did before M there's an immediate acceptance of something typically that's that's the shattering of the belief system is the acceptance of something that is more uh more honest and um and more genuine to the to the more more close to the innate child that that we all were mhm um is that common first of all that people have these major major sort of life-changing appreciations of of of something and then secondly um is that um is that by itself sufficient sometimes to drive change I'd be careful with the common word but it happens a lot and I typically hear about it kind of the way you described it um months even sometimes years later right like I it hit me one day or this thing was happening and I wasc incredibly compelled to do it the old way and I heard something so and so said in my ear you know or something against that belief system um and that's what's so tricky about um that process at the bridge or if you want to talk about experiential um Journeys using experiential therapies I mean just going to a process a group therapy process residential is an experiential intervention right and so to be able to put my finger on what was it you know what what exactly was it you know and can I prove that that was the thing like it's interesting for me in both cases it came down to a therapist M pushing very hard hard but very kindly against a set of assumptions

[02:05:28] MH it was me saying something offering it up the same answer and the person saying what about this what about this what about you know and and and and just maybe describe it as a loving confrontation yeah um that that when fully backed into a corner in an unthreatening way collapse the scaffolding of a mental model yeah and and thank God I mean that's you when you tell that about putting your finger on that like I've got so much gratitude sitting here you know I mean obviously I know the moments you know I know several of the moments um and you know it is common I think the spirit of you in this example is putting yourself in a position for it to happen and there being a process to get this guarded version of self out of the way enough to allow something like that to happen right and there's a lot going on to create that or to to cultivate that possibility yeah I I think that's Absol absolutely the maybe the lesson I would want somebody to learn from this is in science there's an expression that I think it was Louis Pastor that said that you know Chance favors the prepared mind and the idea is that great scientific breakthroughs don't just happen they happen to people who are toiling in the lab failing failing failing trying again trying again um constantly thinking about the problem and yes usually something lucky happens that that trips them in the direction of a discovery it's it's often uh very uh very much an accident um but that accident can't happen if you're not on the field that accident doesn't happen if you're in the stands absolutely and maybe that's the the takeaway I would want somebody to have here which is you're very unlikely to have that Eureka moment if you're not mired in the trenches of going through the painful work of figuring out your story understanding trying to create the map of what's Happening um it's it's unlikely to happen when you're when you're continuing the distractions or the numbing behaviors right absolutely and to speak to just you know sometimes

[02:08:15] I guess the frustration with in the individual one-on-one therapeutic Dynamic would be or you know I've heard um a lot of therapists who many of the therapists who would ask the question why would somebody go to a residential program that wasn't um an addict um or alcoholic um like you talk about the frustrations of like the goals not being able to put the knowing into acting like you see this person we have four steps forward we have this great 55 minute session right and then six days later they come back and and I'm like who the who the hell is this what happened to them right well what happened to them is more than likely they went back and lived underneath the same roof with their biggest traum yeah right and so you know in your experience and many others having the ability to get that um you know that separation if you will you know that season of

[02:09:13] Separation to make that possible not the only way to make that possible because again we paint ourselves in a hole to where you mean if I can't go to a residential program can't heal right we certainly don't want to paint that because then we've got a lot of folks without hope right but one of one of the ways absolutely and do you do do you view your work today the work you do just with individual clients as something that you prefer to only do with people once they're coming out of a residential program or do you take clients that are saying hey I I think I need help I'm not ready to fully commit to doing something is intensive and committed as residential care either one yeah absolutely um because you mentioned that like it's it's a journey right like

[02:10:01] I'm not healed past tense typically isn't a reality right we're all on a healing journey I hope um and so yeah that we can have these lightning bolt moments and make this get this momentum make this progress you you describe your experience of it and also know that the work can continues right because back to the language of these maladaptive behaviors and all the muscle memory like to have a Eureka moment just completely wipe that out right but when you talk about that scenario that you know yeah if I know somebody has been through a residential program and I know kind of have an idea of what they did because I have familiarity with where they were at then I can do a certain thing with that but at the same time like just I guess the fire that it lights for that person that you've been talking about so much that like is is finally getting to the cusp or to that place of I think I I think I need to look at something like I I got a lot of good you know you talked about that person but something's just not right you know and I and to be at that point of that Journey that we talked about not being linear um and having um a system if you will where the background I believe with that group experiential process has a different way of uh making that one-on-one relationship and back to the word efficient you know and Trauma efficiency you know like and being hopefully being able to help recognize here's here's the what and the when and let's make sure we're using our time wisely Jeff what advice do you have for for somebody who's out there trying to find a therapist um they've listened to us today and they've been like okay you know these two guys have got me at least thinking I ought to maybe maybe um scratch this a little bit see if this scab bleeds um what are the attributes they should be looking for first of all how do they even begin to like what do you go on Google and search trauma based therapy how do you how do you find somebody and more importantly when you find somebody how do you say look I'm going to give this three or four sessions to determine if this is a good use in my time what are you looking for is it hey if I'm not uncomfortable in three or four sessions this probably this person probably isn't doing a good job what are the metrics I certainly want some input from a professional a seasoned professional um a personal referral if you will you you mentioned I just did go Google like trauma informed is kind of like the buzz thing and what does this mean did you did you go to a 45 minute seminar on trauma does affect folks and now you're trauma informed right yeah is there a certification that people should be aware of that says you're a true trauma based therapist there are several but I would be more interested in I my what I what I do when I look at bios um is sometimes I get more concerned about the more Specialties I see right and you know a niche you know is so when I see these lists that cover um every class that someone takes during a graduate program for counseling or um that that troubles me you know because how come well because it it looks great I cover all of these different things but no depth yeah but like how many like how much muscle memory do you have as a clinician working with a certain population the way that you do it you know and and and where did that muscle memory come from uh so um and and that's a that's a big part of what I do you know is is helping folks make sure you know that they are with the right person or they can go that's where I go with the efficiency of it like knowing the story learning the story getting that eye openening moment and then that hint that someone wants something different right and then to be a part of that process or to put them in the direction Point them in in the right direction what else should they be looking for so so they they find somebody they think you know they even get a personal referral that says this person is good how should they evaluate what is going on and if they're on the right path within a month for example what's a sign that things are going well what's a sign that things are not going well I personally think that sometimes uh I would I would say that challenge like how how challenged do you feel right um how do how do you feel going into a session how do you feel after the session okay what's a good sign to that to the going is is is going in apprehensive and coming out exhausted a good sign I think yeah yeah absolutely I don't think we're I don't think it's a good story when it's like I can't wait to talk to Jeff because I'm going to get to grip for 55 minutes and he's going to let me pay him for that right now it's happened before and and I would just say we need to call this what it is okay you know if this is where you want to put your anger at for an hour we can do that but let's call it what it is cuz we're not working on change here right so um what's happening what what's being illuminated right because they wouldn't call it a blind spot if I could see it right so what's happening within that back and forth that's illum that's what I what did I not know what made me think what made me pause but the main thing is what's different and you know not all therapeutic relationships are a good match and so to just know that that's a that's a reality and to give yourself permission to you know after an adequate amount of time this isn't working let's not keep doing this you know let's not keep doing something that's not working you know life short I'm looking at uh my last entry before I left the bridge uh I I see a couple of great lines here so one of my one of my favorite other co-residents there MH um she said this she said I asked God why he beat me down this year and he said he broke me open I thought that was very powerful mhm you said um on the way out the more you cry here the more you win here I also thought that was uh that was pretty interesting there there's just no Escape it is there like it's very very difficult if if the name of the game is

[02:16:56] I have to become vulnerable to become connected right right that's that's the central thesis here I am disconnected and I am using something to stay disconnected sometimes those things are obviously bad like drugs and alcohol sometimes and many times they are not that obviously bad like work and perfectionism exactly um or cleanliness or you pick it right depending on the extent of it um but I have to get vulnerable to be connected and being vulnerable feels like getting broken down and you're going to shed some tears right exactly and the sheer fact or thought of shedding the tears might amplify the vulnerability through the roof right so it's written all over the walls literally I mean if you remember group rooms with emotion words on the walls right and to have clinicians sit in that room as guests of our hours and you know refer to them as negative emotions you know and I'm just I squirm in my seat right because maybe they're not as comfortable but like there's a utility to all of these emotions right and I like in stuff in emotions to like tightening the string on a guitar and you think of how many times how many times that you've stuffed that emotion how and then you know what what happens and that thing right there I think a lot of folks have been misinformed or it was an old way of doing things but I think a lot of folks go into it thinking that they've got to have this explosion right with their emotions like for the thing to happen and you know if being lost in my emotion is if if is if drowning in a pool of Tears is what trauma integration is then let me have no part of it right because if disregulated emotions is what comes out of the work then I keep referring to them as guards my guards my protective

[02:18:56] Parts they've got more reason than ever to do their job right you just introduced me to vulnerability and it was overwhelming right so when working with the client regardless of the setting it's befriending vulnerability and to introduce vulnerability as overwhelming right that is counterproductive right right and these these protective selves you mentioned back to the connection and human connection is vulnerable right it's it's not something that's meant to be controlled there's unknowns right there's another person um we don't know we really don't know what they're going to do what they're going to say how we're going to be received right that's that's vulnerable and if you look at it within look through the lens of these detective

[02:19:51] Parts my guards like they think the irony is the way the means by which they do their job typically brings me the thing that they most fear all right so another example okay let's say that a client this is one that that that works sometimes um let's say it's a client like one of their things is they've got some trauma they've got some insecurities around betrayals right and they're in a relationship and one day their partner comes home and tells them that their ex is back working at the hospital where they work at okay now who wants to hear that nobody wants to hear that right but it's going to be especially bad news for somebody with a betrayal file right it's going to be very vulnerable right so here introduce introduce vulnerability into the equation this is where the disconnect self shows up I have to do something to take care of that vulnerability right so

[02:20:58] I have a I I have this avoid him part I used to call him the too cool for school part right and he was born out of hearing a lot of what kind of man's he going to be what kind of man's he going to be so in other words a man this part of me doesn't believe that a man says something like you know I'm scared I'm vulnerable so this part of me says what do you you know like you want to hear about all the skeletons in my closet I don't care that your ex is back at work five years ago right but when that partner is on their 7 to S shifts it's hard for me to be connected

[02:21:38] Jeff when all that stuff starts going on through insecurities and betrayals and things of that nature so I need something right something to step in and take me away and that's where that disconnection comes in for some folks it would be drinking or whatnot then the spirit of the the example that I'm giv and trying to give the irony is again the problem is not having the parts it's how they do their job and the relationship between those parts right because eventually what happens is is that as I do the thing with um let's say the let's say the behavior is drinking right so I'm drinking I'm drinking I'm drinking and eventually like I get to a point to where um not thinking that much about what might be going on at that hospital and then I get to a point to where my buddy leaves we were watching the ball game I was able to be connected

[02:22:32] Jeff in front of him but now I'm really starting to get up in my head about what might be going on at the hospital where my partner's at yeah so when the phone finally Rings okay at 11:30 or 12 or whatever it's not connected Jeff that answers the phone right I'm using myself in this madeup example right but it's going to be a disconnected version of Jeff right you having fun why the night's so young maybe you guys will have time to go at it again right all this woundedness starts coming out and So eventually what happens is in this example if this partner's got any healthy going on I'm going to come downstairs one day and there's going to be a note that says I wasn't created to save you I can't do this you need some help and now have I ever been any sadder you know than I am because that it's a triangle of vulnerability sad shame and fear right and that's what all these guarded parts of self they're there to protect us against that but you see the means by which the protected disconnected self did its work actually long played out brought me the thing that I feared the most right so now here

[02:23:46] I am sitting at this table alone realizing what's happened right and that's that's that's that's how that happened so back to disconnection connection what do connected Jeff says I know this is my stuff and I've got work to do it's a reminder that I've got work to do but I got to tell you I got to be honest with me it bothers me what you just told me about this person being back working with you it bothers me um but that's a very vulnerable thing to say of course you can only really say that if your partner is equally vulnerable right because if your partner is not vulnerable that that message isn't going to land and that's going to be triggering to that person and I guess all of this is a long-winded way of saying you you you have to have two healthy people to make a relationship work you can't just have one absolutely

[02:24:39] ABS that might not be welcomed right that emotional vulnerable self might not be welcomed and that's information that's necessary right um necessary information about my partner because in the example I'm not asking remember it does it bothers me in that example it Bo I'm not asking you to do anything I'm not asking you to quit your job or anything like that but I just need you to know my truth and I've got work to do around this but it does bother me it scares me to death see and and you know that I it scares me to death probably the bravest words I've ever said to another human being in my life it scares me to death I spent so many years trying to act like it didn't if you're in that relationship where one of you is feeling like hey I I can I can be vulnerable here but it's not being reciprocated how do you what are the tips for maybe helping your your spouse if this is thinking about it as a sort of you know a marriage or something like that um what what can the what can the vulnerable member of that relationship do to help the other one because it's not going to be tenable indefinitely right so it's how do you how do you lovingly get that person to to come to a place where they they want to get help well you're certainly a lot of folks have wasted years trying to pull and push people into help right um You just have to be the Agent of Change in the relationship right you have to break the dance so in this particular dance is it's I'm wanting to be vulnerable and you're not having anything of it something's got to change right so you got to sharpen your skills with the boundaries right boundaries boundaries boundaries and you know sometimes it's a worn out word but it's a hell of a skill to be able to utilize right like and to be able to set a healthy boundary you know top tier boundary setting often times doesn't include the word you blows folks away when you just talk about me I realize when this Behavior happen whatever fill in the blank when this behavior that it it's affecting me you know I'm I'm building resentment and this isn't good for me so when this

[02:27:02] Behavior happens again I'm going to choose to do blank right and whatever blank is is whatever change looks like right it might be in this example like you know I'm not taking I want to be able to share my heart with you but evidently I can't right so I'll be taking it to my best friend or you know and so to be able to to to set the boundary and set a boundary where where there's a consequence it's something that I can hold it's something that I can do right because a boundary without a consequence is useless Jeff I want to thank you very much for um for not just coming today but for obviously being a really important part of my life um I owe you a great debt of gratitude as I do a number of therapists who I've been really lucky to work with um but I will forever reflect on what can only be described as just an unbelievably difficult experience that

[02:28:04] I'm so glad I had no idea how bad it was going to be when I reluctantly agreed to go because I just don't think I ever would have done it MH um and I've had the privilege of encouraging many people to go since then U not just to the bridge but to to other places places as well and um I I I think almost without exception it's it's helped them uh in fact I know it has I can't think of an exception where it hasn't so you know if someone's listening to us and they're sort of contemplating either dipping their toe in you know by working with a therapist and trying to probe some of these things or if they're thinking about jumping in the lake and then going to a residential place like the bridge um what would you say to them if there's a voice saying it listen if there's a voice even if it's a whisper it's there for a reason and I think more important than anything else you're either going to deal with it or it's going to deal with you and my hope for that you and humanity and what we do as far as helping people in this case we're talking about emotional health but longevity um yeah it's like right deal with this grab the bull by the horns thank you Jeff thank you so much for having me it's honor to be part of your journey um and congratulations on everything keep up the good work brother [Music]
