The conversation covers key considerations including success rates, clinic volume, costs, and quality indicators. The discussion emphasizes that IVF is typically the most expensive out-of-pocket healthcare expense for most people, with current costs around $20,000 per cycle.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- IVF clinics are required by law to report every cycle and success rate (established in the 1990s) [02:27]
- Average clinic volume benchmark should be at least 100 cycles per year [03:07]

- Consider academic centers for additional research/education focus [05:36]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Genetic testing options should be discussed but not mandatory [04:52]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"We're one of the few fields of medicine where actually you can get clinic specific success rates." [02:27]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What specific genetic testing options are available?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] If someone's listening to this and they're trying to figure out how to select a good IVF clinic, what what what are the things they should be looking for? Because I would have to assume that it's like any other field of medicine, right? Not all doctors and not all clinics are created equal. And just because you see a lot of advertising doesn't tell you anything, right? So, so, so in other words, you you're going to have to become a very very intelligent consumer. For most people, this will be the single most expensive outofpocket health care expense they have. Yeah, that's true.

[00:00:40] And so, it's not just that it's the most expensive health care decision they're ever going to make. It might be one of the most consequential as well. For sure. And yet I I mean I know what I suggest to people when someone says, "Peter, you know, my wife and I are thinking about getting IVF. What do you think?" I just go down the rabbit hole of like here's a hundred questions I would ask. Yeah. Um and it usually begins with tell me your success rate individually. I don't care about the national success rate. It means nothing to me. So So how would you counsel someone who's trying to come up with their checklist of questions to ask?

[00:01:18] Yeah, there's a good it's a good question and you know these days it's a little bit easier because obviously there's the internet and there's suggested questions online you could look at um there it's true there is some variability amongst clinics although there's a lot of consolidation happening in the field as well so a lot of the you know practices are becoming common to to most clinics um but some of it is practical right like which clinics are close to where you live because as you have to go and get these ultrounds yeah you got to go in every few days.

[00:01:48] So, you can't be going to another state. You know, most people can't. But in most major cities, you have multiple options in ma in most major cities. That's true. Yeah. Um so, you're right about individual clinic success rates, although technically it's hard to use those to compare them to each other because you don't necessarily. So, how do you normalize it to Right. Right. So one thing for sure look at the the success rates and we're one of the few fields of medicine where actually you can get clinic specific success rates. So you mean publicly it's available or it's available. Yeah. So where do you find it? Well the

[00:02:27] CDC until recently there is a law actually that says you have to report every IVF cycle and the success rate that was passed in the '9s. So because of that the CDC tracks this although all the people that work in that department were fired recently. So we don't know what's going to happen with that. But also our professional organizations called the society of assisted reproductive technology has a website.

[00:02:49] It's called sart.org is the URL. And all the clinics in the US or most of them are on there and they have to report their success rates and they're published every year. There's usually like a two-year lag because the babies have to be born and everything. So I would send people to that website first.

[00:03:07] Look at the clinics in your area. look at the success rates keeping in mind right that populations might be different in in different clinics I probably would go to a clinic that does a sufficient volume you know you have to do at least 100 cycles I would say but you know ideally more than that your your clinic has how many doctors our clinic has about six doctors and how many total cycles do you guys do a year we do like six to 800 retrievalss a year there's a lot of variability there's clinics that do thousands. There are some that do like 50. So that would be one factor that I think is important.

[00:03:45] Just volume like And you have how many embryologists? We have something like nine embryologists. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. There is a shortage of of embryologists, you know, nationwide and reproductive endocrinologists because the demand for IVF is going up, right? So I would definitely look at the clinic success rates, look at the volume. Um the other thing you know with the internet especially you can look at patient reviews you know word of mouth and um got to take those with a grain of salt right. Yeah they tend to be negative selecting not everybody who has a great experience necessarily going to post it on Reddit but everyone who has a bad one does. Yeah. Yeah. So you have to take that with a grain of salt but there are objective ways and you can also like interview your your doctor. Yeah. questions you should be asking of the doctor that are independent of the objective metrics that we might have just discussed. Um, you can ask about their sort of philosophy about protocols about things like add-ons like genetic testing. You know, for example, it's like are you a clinic where everybody is encouraged to do a genetic testing? You know, that's not necessarily the clinic

[00:04:52] I would choose, right? you you talk to the patient about the pros and cons and you let the patient decide and we do a lot of genetic testing so it's not like I'm against it or anything but you know you want to get a sense of the vibe of the clinic you know are they just you know interested in in money not that doctors ever think like that but you know what I mean uh so sometimes it it takes having a consultation with one or more clinics to to see where you feel more comfortable you know I'm a little bit biased towards some academic centers just because our our missions include like education and and research etc. Uh but there's several very excellent private clinics as well.

[00:05:36] What would be some red flags if you're going through this process? Um and by the way, do you have a is is how much of a delta is there in cost in within a same city or or do do prices tend to converge within a given geography? Yeah, within a given geography they're pretty similar and it's not cheap. Yeah. So, what are we at today? Fully loaded cost.

[00:05:57] You know, an IVF cycle is probably around $20,000 per cycle. But that doesn't include genetic testing or does including genetic testing? Yeah. Per cycle. But how does that compare to 20 years ago? Is that more or less inflation? Prices like most things have gone up. It has. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, and all it I guess it should go up just based on the cost of labor that goes into all these things. And there's, you know, even though the genetic testing's coming down. Yeah. Innovations and things like I you're right, like you think as volume goes up eventually prices go down, but that quite hasn't quite happened. As new things get at it, then it just tends to become more expensive. And most people are probably still paying out of pocket. Most people are not getting this covered by insurance. Again, depends where you live, but across the country. Yeah. And

[00:06:40] I think there are now there are 24 states that offer some kind of fertility coverage. about 15 of them include IVF. So most of the You're right. Most places you're paying out of pocket if your employer doesn't happen to offer infertility insurance coverage. Yeah. Um so red flags, you know, again, communication with the clinic. So a lot of your experience is going to be communicating with nurses and, you know, Yeah. just setting up appointments, coordinators.

[00:07:14] Yeah. So you you know you want to get a sense of what that is like because that could be stressful if it's not smooth and oftentimes you know our our clinic included sometimes it's not smooth. I mean there have been you know some things we try and do like texting and apps and things to make the communication you know easier and um but doesn't always work the way it's supposed to kind of thing and you want to get time with your doctor. So some clinics you hardly ever see the doctor and you see maybe the ultrasographer.

[00:07:46] Not that that's bad there, you know, but it's kind of nice. Some patients prefer to have that sort of more frequent interaction with their So there's probably a sweet spot in volume where you it's probably an inverted U-shape where if they're too low, they don't have the reps. If they're too high, it's a bit of a sweat shop and a factory and you you want you want in the middle there.
