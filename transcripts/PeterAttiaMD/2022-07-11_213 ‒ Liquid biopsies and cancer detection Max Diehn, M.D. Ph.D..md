Max Diehn is a Professor of Radiation Oncology at Stanford and a clinical radiation oncologist specializing in lung cancer. Max’s research focuses on developing novel methods for detecting circulating tumor DNA in the blood of cancer patients and on elucidating the molecular pathways and genes associated with cancer. His interests also include uncovering biomarkers that can predict patient survival, responses to therapy, and disease recurrence. In this packed episode, Max discusses the history of blood-based cancer screening and the importance of understanding the predictive value of tests—sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value – and how these metrics play into cancer screening. Max then goes in depth on the topic of liquid biopsies, including the history, current landscape, and possible future of liquid biopsies as a cancer detection tool. He discusses how these non-invasive blood tests can detect DNA/RNA from tumor cells released into the blood as well as the different methods one can use to predict if a cancer is present. He gets granular on the topic of cell-free DNA/RNA signature, methylation patterns, and the importance of knowing mutation information, and he ends with a discussion on the exciting future of liquid biopsies and how we can possibly get to the panacea of cancer screening.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Max Diehn discussing liquid biopsies and cancer detection. The conversation focuses on the evolution, current state, and future potential of liquid biopsy technology for cancer detection and monitoring. Key areas covered include cell-free DNA detection, circulating tumor cells, and the challenges of early cancer detection. The discussion emphasizes both the promise and limitations of current liquid biopsy technology, particularly in screening applications versus monitoring known cancers.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Cell-free DNA fragments are typically 170 bases long and wrapped around histones [01:12:30]
- Current liquid biopsy sensitivity for stage 1 lung cancer is around 5% [01:45:00]
- Mutation-based detection methods can achieve sensitivity of one part in a million [01:32:00]
- Most cell-free DNA (80-90%) comes from white blood cells [01:52:00]
- Cancer-derived cell-free DNA fragments are slightly shorter than normal cell-free DNA [01:52:30]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Regular cancer screening is still important as liquid biopsies are not yet reliable enough for general screening [01:40:00]
- Consider liquid biopsies as complementary to, not replacement for, traditional screening methods [01:55:00]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Cell-free DNA levels in healthy individuals: 1-5 nanograms per ml [01:15:00]
- Advanced cancer patients may show hundreds of nanograms per ml [01:15:30]
- Current FDA-approved liquid biopsies:
  - Guardant Health
  - Foundation One
  - Cell Search
  - Others [02:00:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The sensitivity of the methylation-based approaches is significantly inferior to that of the mutation-based approaches" [01:35:00]

"Even though they're exciting technologies and we're very hopeful that they will [work], we shouldn't just give them a pass because they're high-tech and not do the right clinical science" [02:24:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the potential for combining multiple detection methods (methylation, mutation, fragmentomics) to improve sensitivity?
2. How might liquid biopsies be integrated with AI/machine learning for improved accuracy?
3. What role might liquid biopsies play in monitoring treatment response?

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia hey max thanks so much for making time today so wonderful to see you again it's been a lot of years huh it's been a long time actually i can't remember the last time we saw each other but since we kind of we started together in medical school at stanford but then finished a little bit different times that kind of it's been a while since we saw each other yeah well as i was sort of joking earlier this is this is we're going to have like a whole subset of the drive podcast which is based on the stanford mstp uh students between carl you and josh so um you know again kind of speaks to the to the quality of people that you know were a part of that program um so so let's tell folks a little bit about kind of work you did so as you mentioned obviously we started in medical school together we have some really funny stories from the beginning of medical school which i think will refrain from telling at this point in time but they i could have a whole podcast just on some of that stuff and then after the first two years of medical school i went right off into the clinical stuff and then you went off into the lab tell folks about whose lab you you went to and what it is that you started pursuing and frankly how you even made that decision as you pointed out as part of the md phd program here i the the way it is done in most programs you split the curriculum with splitting medical school in half doing the first two more classroom based years first then doing the phd work in the laboratory and then going back for the clinical work and so that is there's an important transition point there when you're finishing the classroom part of medical school and deciding what lab to work in and um i ultimately chose to do my dissertation with pat brown who is a professor in biochemistry here uh at stanford uh he is no longer a lot of your listeners may know of him though because he's now a ceo of impossible foods or was until recently i think he just transitioned to a slightly different role but founder and ceo of initially of impossible foods but he was here a faculty member and um what really attracted me to his lab was that he had um you know just around that time invented a technology for measuring the expression of basically all the genes in the genome uh with a technique called dna microarrays and that at the time was revolutionary but before that we were always measuring everything in a one or a handful of genes at a time in experiments and now we could measure tens of thousands in one experiment it just seemed to me that this was opening up whole new fields that we would be able to learn so much and that's why i chose uh to pursue that lab so what did you do for your actual dissertation what was that what was the project that you worked on i i had a little bit unusual dissertation then i worked on many different projects it was a very unique time uh in in in the lab and pat's lab as well as in labs in general where and i've seen this happen uh since uh several times but when there's a new technology that's developed that's sort of transformative it opens up so many doors simultaneously that you know you have this new tool that no one's ever had before a new lens to through which to view biology and so you can just immediately think of thousands of questions that would be interesting to ask and so i i worked on a variety of different things the mainly two main errors one is immunology the other uh oncology or cancer biology and those were my two interests coming into medical school and so um you know i i felt fortunate that i was able to do projects in in some of both um as far as you know maybe i just had one or two of them one of the projects was focused on t cells which are a type of course of white blood cell lymphocyte that are critical part of the adaptive immune system and um so we have this new tool to measure all the genes in the human genome at one time to see how they go up and down after you you know perturb cells and so we were very interested to see what genes are turned on and off in t cells when you activate them when you stimulate them through their receptor the t cell receptor either by itself or with a co-stimulatory signal you would look at the t cell it's stimulated and you're are you actually measuring protein um or rna rna yeah the technology is a was a way of uh measuring rna so transcripts so the intermediate between dna proteins of course and um so uh we could see uh you know hundreds and thousands of genes changing as we uh manipulated um the cells and so building a catalog of all the genes that uh that are turned on or down regulated turned off when you activate t cells using different signals and that catalog then of course has been very helpful for subsequent studies in better understanding and teasing apart um the uh mechanism of t-cell activation which has gotten increasingly more interesting of course now with the advent of immunotherapy yeah so there's a lot of things there that are interesting one of them is the instability of rna this is going to become relevant as we start to talk about the differences between cell free dna and rna but at the time how difficult was it to basically keep all of this rna intact as you catalogued the uh generation of mrna from dna as this signal of gene expression i mean was that one of the big technical challenges of this technique that for sure is a hurdle in all work that's focused on rna which as you mentioned is chemically uh relatively unstable particularly when you compare it to dna which is much more stable and so one has to be very careful uh in any experiment whether you'll measure a single rna where you measure 20 000 rnas to really try to preserve the sample in a way such that you minimize the potential chemical degradation of rna so there are you know relaboratory methods to do that of course so for example if you're in that example of the t-cell stimulation experiment um you know you the cells are alive the rna of course is maintained it's really once the cells die that the degradation issue starts happening so you you design the experiment in such a way that you're very careful to immediately you know add solutions that protect the rna after you kill the cells at the end of the experiment so that there's no time for chemical degradation processes i had a my other main project in phd was actually we really start struggled with this because it was a separate project my rotation project which is the first project you do in a lab when you're kind of trying to figure out if you want to go there where we developed a method to isolate self rna that's stuck to the endoplasmic reticulum inside cells because that is where rnas go for genes that are ex secreted from the cells or that are surface proteins in the cells and we were interested in cataloging those because those are interesting for diagnostic purposes and therapeutic purposes so we had to purify the subset of the rna that was uh stuck to the these organelles called the the endoplasmic reticulum and to do that you there's a very long procedure where you have to build special gradients and float you know gently slice the cells and then they fully float the membranes that they're stuck to at various levels in a test tube and that required a lot of work in a cold room where you know you're basically you test tubes in a four degree room but so is the experimenter you you know you have to wear jackets and stuff because you're working basically in a fridge it's all to maintain the integrity of the rna as well as you can add chemicals to try to to stabilize the rna so this is something that was critical at the time to really try to work out methods to stabilize the rna and how much of an insight could you get into non-coding sequences of genes where they're not making proteins but we now know of course that these non-coding segments can be very important as well could you could you gain any insights there so with the technique we were using at that time uh we could not directly because we were focused on measuring the coding portions of the the of the genes that of the transcripts that that code for proteins um and we had to decide at the beginning of each experiment which genes we measured because basically we had to create a probe for each you had to have the primers and yeah the primers for it and so you had to make a decision so at the time we were not focused on that um but the um the uh subsequently their um this this approach was used uh uh earlier in the some of the early work on long non-coding rnas and i was um largely led by a former postdoc from uh pat brown's lab who was there while i was a grad student named howard chang who is a professor here at stanford as you may know so i think you finished your phd in about three years correct uh yes it took about three years yeah three years or something like that and then and then you went back now and you started your clinical rotations did you have a sense when you went back for the last two years of medical school that you definitely wanted to be a clinician so which would mean not just finishing medical school but then doing a residency or because you know some people in the mt phd program you know just say look i just want to be a pure scientist not a physician scientist i'm going to finish medical school and get my md but i'm not going to do any clinical training where were you on that spectrum at the beginning of that final two years i was set on doing a residency i wasn't sure yet in what but i was set on doing it you know actually my my sort of um decision point was for me was made prior to med school when i was at an undergrad initially i thought i was going to do graduate school and go for a phd and focus on research for my career but then my father was diagnosed with lymphoma while i was junior in college and the you know the the journey that he went through uh in interacting with the oncologist and the medical team as part of that and really seeing how little we knew about uh many things and uh how suboptimal treatments were really convinced me that um that number one i don't know i want to be on the doctor's side not just on the patient side with my father and be able to help people help patients at you know the time one of their life might be the worst time of their life as well as to try to move the field forward to improve treatments that you know while they worked somewhat obviously were not good enough and so does that mean that even coming into medical school not only did you know you wanted to be a physician and a scientist but did you already have kind of an inkling that oncology was where you wanted to be yeah that's exactly right yes i knew i wanted to work in one of the cancer uh specialties um what i didn't realize when i was at first you mentioned is how many options there are in that of course you know you were probably looking at it mostly through the lens of medical oncology um that's right whereas of course you have surgical oncology radiation oncology and other sorts of avenues um that's right and remind me were you born in germany were you born in the u.s no yeah i was born in germany i was born in munich and i didn't come to the us until i was 11 years old okay and you grew up on the east coast yes we initially moved to south florida um and then when i was at sophomore high school we moved to uh connecticut uh the northeast and then i went to harvard as an undergrad so i was in the northeast until i came out here but then i've never i've never left anywhere and i've lived longer here than anywhere else in the world yeah i know that feeling um so you go into the clinic and now it's basically a decision of you know medical oncology radiation oncology or god forbid something like surgical oncology though i'm guessing that was probably third on the list of three options you know i did honestly strongly consider it and i i i do like the the procedural aspects of it and that's the one reason why i chose ultimately what i chose um so i did and i you know every surgical on my surgical chains when i had a choice i always chose the uh you know oncologic subspecialties and you know did some surgeon uh did some gynoc uh surgery rotations but um ultimately chose not to do that in large part because i you know i saw that i thought it would be difficult to balance with with research and of course people do it very successfully but but i think it is harder in general in the surgical specialties so how did you ultimately decide on radiation oncology then yeah uh radiation oncology like you mentioned i i was sort of leaning towards medical oncology because that's what i'd seen through my my dad's um journey um but i uh i did a rotation in uh radiation oncology actually in large part because my wife who was also a medical student at stanford who you of course know um uh did a research year in the department of radiation oncology she at the time was also interested in oncology and so that actually is how i got exposed to the field um while we were dating i would often visit her in the lab and so you know i kind of got uh exposed in that way to to to the department in the field and then so it made me want to try it as a rotation and then i really enjoyed it i not a variety of things i enjoyed about it from a patient care standpoint the it seemed to me that the rational college had a little more time in clinic to spend with each patients you know we generally see less patients in a day than than might be seen in medical oncology and that seemed very attractive to me the other thing i um really liked was the technology aspects i was always been interested in technology aspects uh you know both you know new technologies in the research space but then also you know technologies for treating patients with rational ecology is very procedurally heavy it's of course a field where we do a lot of imaging to see where tumors are in a patient's body and then we have fancy robots that deliver the radiation very precisely um so it just seemed like a great field to combine my my love of oncology and patient care with my interests in technology development and then lastly i kind of saw it as a field where they really compared to medical oncology there there wasn't as much work being done in the laboratory at the molecular level um and it seemed like an opportunity to to make a difference in a field where there weren't so many people working you know one of the things i talked about with carl was the challenge of keeping his hand in the lab during those last two years of medical school and then during his psychiatry residency um he mentioned that he was he really found himself in a great situation when he did his residency where he was effectively allowed to do kind of a post-doc and he was freed from you know certain things he didn't go to you know lab meetings and journal clubs and things like that but he still got to do a little bit of work were you able to do anything like that during your residency or were you really strictly focused on just the clinical training for it's was it four years uh yeah so radiation ecology is uh i did an internship in medicine uh here at stanford and then it's four years of radiation oncology so five total um during internship of course uh as as you i'm sure remember there is no time to do anything else although i do remember trying to write some papers in the call room uh you know to finishing up work from p from the phd um but um the um the for the rachel oncology uh uh residency programs have a research track for individuals who are interested in laboratory-based research called the holman pathway which is uh in other fields kind of called short tracking or fast tracking it's a similar idea where basically one can trade in some of the clinical training time for research time um and so that's what i did which gave me a postdoc time of about two years during my four years of radiation oncology residency during that post-doc time i i had clinic activities about half a day to a day a week um and the rest of the time the other days were in the lab so it actually was a really good preview of what you know my life would be like once i finished all the training and was a faculty member myself and so that that allowed me to kind of keep a foot in the clinic while mainly focusing on the postdoctoral research so when you finish your training obviously the first decision you had to make is do you want to stay at stanford i'm guessing that between you know the connections you already had there jenny was probably by this point already out of her training and in practice that was probably a very uh high activation energy to leave um tell me about the department of radiation oncology at stanford was it a natural fit for the types of problems you wanted to solve on the research side yes i mean the the department that's here at stanford has a very long history um it was actually one of the very first departments of radiation oncology um in the u.s racial oncology grew out of radiology which is as you listeners probably know is a diagnostic arm of radiology where you do imaging mainly to diagnose uh disease um and um initially back in the 50s 40s 50s it was part of racial culture as part of those departments but then here our first chairman henry kaplan who is a very famous radiation oncologist and physician scientist um became the first chair of racial oncology and sort of led the the movement to develop it as its own specialty um and then he quickly put the department on the map because of his work in curing hodgkin's disease with radiotherapy which um you know was uh this was uh in the around the 50s where um you know those were some of the first successes of taking patients basically young patients with a hodgkin's disease type of lymphoma that was incurable previously who now you know the majority could be cured with radiation made the new york times you know at the time and all you know was headlines and at the time you know there were articles about how now radiation will cure all cancer and look we're on the path you know that of course didn't turn out to be that way we still have uh many many patients we can't cure um but it sort of was one of the first examples of this the hype that you get at each time a new therapy comes where you know then think okay now we've really solved it but ultimately you know it gets more complicated but that of course established department is one of the very leading departments in the world and it has continued that the department here throughout its history has um had a very strong interest in laboratory-based research is all thanks to henry kaplan who was doing laboratory research at the time also while seeing patients and so there were already faculty that were laboratory based even just phds who were fully laboratory based which wasn't the case in many radiation college departments and so i really like that here that within radiation oncology this was a place where i could see that the kind of research i wanted to do was valued and there was already you know mentors that had done it and successfully and those things are important when you're a young physician scientist to have mentors that can show you if you run into trouble how to overcome obstacles at what point in your evolution did the idea of liquid biopsies start to become of interest obviously that's something i really want to talk about today because it's it's something that i think people are just starting to hear about i mean it's something i've been following for about six years uh obviously you've been following it for a lot longer than that but i think even in the in the in the sort of broader public eye the past year i think a lot has happened to bring this to the fore but but i still think for many people it's still a bit of a black box um so so at what point how many years ago did this sort of become something that landed on your screen as an area where you wanted to put focus yes um so as these things often happen um i did not start my lab with the idea of focusing on liquid biopsies um i really uh got there by following the results we we got from some experiments and you know i think one of the uh keys to being a successful scientist whether you're a physician scientist or a lab laboratory scientist is following the data following the data that you generate um uh to where it leads you as opposed to you know saying i have to work in one area so i was actually going to work on a different different air initially i started this the whole this line of work in my laboratory initially out of a clinic a clinical need i saw and that's in general how i run my laboratory all the research projects we do we start with a clinical need or a clinical um an area where they're it's suboptimal we're doing the clinic whether it's for diagnostic purposes or treatment purpose or whatever with the idea being that that you know that's of course one of the things that having being a physician and taking care of patients is one of the things that i spent a lot of years learning about and also what i have insights into that others might not and those that that's one way i can you know be a useful contributor to the to the field in general and so we always start with clinical errors of clinical need and here this in this case it was one of the main things i struggled with as a junior faculty member which is that i decided to specialize in treating lung cancer clinically so one day a week once i was on faculty i was doing clinic one day a week and i saw lung cancer patients exclusively and i was very frustrated by the fact that after i treated patients so i treat a lot of early stage lung cancer patients these are patients that are stage 1 or 2 lung cancer which means as far as we can tell the lung cancer hasn't spread yet it's still it's just in in the lung where it's started and hasn't spread anywhere and with targeted high dose radiation i can cure the majority of those patients but there's let's say about 20 25 of those patients who ultimately develop recurrence where the cancer comes back but at after after i finish my treatment in that first you know follow-up visit let's say three months after i do the radiation i cannot i could not tell who was going to ultimately have the cancer come back and who had been cured and so state-of-the-art at the time and actually you know is still state-of-the-art today in many ways is just to see the patient every three six twelve months as you get further out and to do scans and see if the cancer has come back without any way of predicting in whom it will right it's really just it's a very reactive approach and very unsatisfying and this is something we went through with my dad also so this was a major frustration for me and also and also very difficult because of the resolution right i mean give people a sense of the resolution we have with traditional imaging so if if i assume where are we at on ct scanners are we at 256 bit are we what's the what's the resolution and speed of a ct scanner today there is a wide variety of that and that that that you may better uh ask somebody who works in that specific field of building those scanners but the i think i maybe uh to rephrase your question a little bit is you know what's how small of a tumor can we see yeah that's where i'm really going which is you know it's if you can see a one by one by one centimeter or a one centimeter diameter tumor that's you're doing pretty well right you can probably see a little smaller than that that's exactly right so it is hard to see things much smaller than uh you know one centimeter in diameter maybe eight millimeters it depends a little bit on the location in the body some areas of course it's easier to see smaller things than others but that's in generally true and so how many cells is that yes so that's great question and uh you know the general sort of rule of thumb is that's about a billion cells already um which is of course a vast number of cancer cells you know again at the time when we can just barely detect it in a patient and and i think it's important for patients to understand the non-linearity of this so you have everything shy of a billion cells is by conventional detection methods undetectable right and then but but you know outside of the most rare tumors anything at a centimeter is not posing a direct threat to the organism you know maybe a really badly placed brain tumor at one centimeter is problematic but for the most part if you talk about a lung cancer liver cancer pancreatic cancer colon cancer etc breast cancer one centimeter is irrelevant at what point does a tumor become in and of itself threatening to the host i mean you could argue by the time it's 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters the tube the burden of tumor itself is fatal and that's how many cells there roughly when you're at the point where the burden of the tumor is actually fatal yeah so the of course whether tumors fail or not as you point out greatly depends on the location sure and in certain areas one can have a ton of tumor without it being fatal and in other areas you have very little room for that but um you know obviously it's uh it's a vol it's a volumetric right so uh it grows by the cube um by the radius multiplied by itself three times and that uh is uh of course non-linear it's it grows much faster the number of cells in a mass are much more you know than just a linear increase in the diameter of the lesion yeah and i think that's the part that's just hard to understand for because we don't we think linearly pretty well we don't think exponentially very well um but again i think i want people to just anchor to this idea that from zero to a billion cells we're pretty much flying blind that's exactly right and it's actually uh in irrelevant to to the work some of the work that we're now doing um if you you realize that many cancers once they have metastasized or spread which is really ultimately what ends up uh killing patients is once the usually when the cancer spreads if the cancer is only localized usually a surgeon or a radiation oncologist can cure that patient but once the cancer spread and is in many places in the body you can't remove it all or radiate at all right so but if you think about a patient who has what's called micro metastatic disease or microscopic disease that has spread elsewhere in the body you could have dozens or even hundreds of these micrometastatic deposits right that are under under half a centimeter yes exactly and so technically millions and tens of billions of cells and it's still undetectable and it's still exactly right and that is a critical issue where that that's a limitation of blind spot of our imaging methods because again we we can't since they're all spread out we can't see them all um but that is one thing that um that one could potentially get a handle on if one had a a test that could be measured let's say in the blood where one could measure contributions from all these you know dozens of micrometastatic deposits and that that one might get uh higher sensitivity and that exactly kind of was the motivation for the liquid biopsy work in in my lab i had no idea how i was going to do that when i started it now let's hit pause for one second max because i think it let's also give people a little bit of the historical context of where there are at least a couple of areas where this was sort of being done although it wasn't great so maybe explain for people how psa cea and ca199 have been used historically because even when we were in medical school and and long before you and i got to medical school those three biomarkers were used now you were always cautioned that at least the cea and the ca199 could never be used for screening but they could be appropriate for following psa has a very complicated history which we could go down the rabbit hole of about how it could be used for screening but you know you can be misled but tell folks a little bit about what those things are and how effective you think they were for what they were trying to do and which elements of those you wanted to replicate for lung cancer and where you wanted to improve upon it yeah great question and for an app you're absolutely right uh when we started thinking about you know developing a blood-based test for initially lung cancer um we of course thought about the exactly examples you pointed out which are the the markers you mentioned like psa are protein biomarkers so these are proteins made by the cancer cells that can be shed into the blood and that where one can then uh measure them in a non-invasive fashion now the main a large issue with with these protein biomarkers is that they are actually not that specific for cancer meaning that these are also proteins that normal cells can make now cancers often tend to make more of them which is why they are potentially of interest but the problem becomes that having low levels of any of those markers does you ca when you when a patient has that you can't know whether that means they have a little bit of cancer in the body or whether it's just that's their baseline what the normal cells are making in their body and that lack of specificity is what it's called meaning you're not so sure when you see it that it's cancer or not cancer was the major achilles heel of the protein-based biomarkers and a lot of work of course had been done in lung cancer previously looking at similar biomarkers um including ca actually which sometimes in some subset of patients can be a good biomarker if the tumor just pumps out a lot of it and the patient has a decent amount of disease so the total level is significantly higher than what a normal patient would have but in most patients that was not the case and so that was you know the protein-based approaches were really state-of-the-art but had this major weakness of the lack of specificity let's maybe use this as a moment to explain to people sensitivity and specificity which are going to become very important as we then factor in prevalence when it comes to screening to understand positive and negative predictive value but i think for now if we can just start with helping people understand what specificity and sensitivity are in terms of probabilities of false positives and false negatives again i think i find this stuff to be so important and yet if you don't i think explain it over and over again it's easy for people to kind of get lost in the details and yet it's so important for what we're about to talk about today that we'll probably end up doing this twice three times yes no i agree with you that these are very important uh topics words that are thrown around a lot and and can be it can be confusing um so uh sensitivity um is uh something that's also known as a synonym for it is true positive rate which is basically the likelihood of uh having a positive test when the patient has the actual condition so let's say in the example of cancer sensitivity is out of you have a 100 cancer patients you have a new blood test out of those 100 cancer patients you know how many of them is the blood test positive so that's sensitivity right so a perfect test would obviously have 100 sensitivity which means 100 out of 100 would test positive in reality to give people a sense of this and you know a mammography might have an 85 percent sensitivity which means if you do a mammogram on 100 women who are known to have breast cancer it might only tell you that 85 of those hundred do so it's correctly identifying 85 it's erroneously it's giving you a false negative in 15 of the 100. that's exactly right yep and in general it's important to realize that there are no perfect tests really um particularly when you start pushing the envelope to seeing trying to see smaller and smaller tumors so while it would of course be great to have a test that's 100 sensitive meaning it catches every cancer patient that is really re unrealistic in the vast majority if not all cases i think is something that sometimes not understood by patients where you know you you have a you go get your mammogram or your your cat scan for lung cancer screening and you know you still patients sometimes still develop a cancer even though they did all those things and you know why is that and that can lead to a lot of frustration but that's because these tests they aren't perfect and they can't they're not always going to pick up a cancer even when it's present my one of my former analysts bob kaplan came up with a great thought experiment to explain this to people which was the reason you can't have perfection is if you drive something to a very very very high sensitivity the specificity must go down and here's the silly example and this is his example so i don't want to take any credit for it but it's brilliant if you wrote a letter max to a thousand women randomly and told every one of them they had breast cancer with no additional knowledge you technically have a test with a hundred percent sensitivity because let's assume i don't know 10 let's assume 50 of those women have breast cancer you have correctly identified them all there are no false negatives in that group so you have a 100 sensitive test the problem is your specificity is in the toilet you have so many false positives that the test is utterly useless so you can have 100 sensitivity if you really want to push that envelope but it it has no clinical utility so you have to and of course i can play the experiment the other way you could send a thousand women a letter that says you absolutely do not have breast cancer and technically you have no false positives but you clearly are going to have false negatives so i love that experiment because it explains that if you if you pull full throttle on sensitivity or specificity that's fine but it doesn't make for a good test because you've undoubtedly compromised the other parameter yep that's absolutely right and that's exactly and i think i agree with you that's a great example um to explain uh how that works and actually that explains a lot of what happens in the in the in the research diagnostic research field in general um that you know you try to push sensitivity but that never is meaningful to report if you don't also report the specificity to look at specificity because it's kind of like a yin and yang if you you push on one the other you know usually one goes up most of the time the other goes down um that is in general how it is unless you really have a dramatic new insight or a new advance where you can just increase sensitivity without also hurting specificity and then i guess just to finish off specifically yeah so that is sort of the inverse of sensitivity which is that if for a patient who does not have cancer so a really is a true negative what we they call it and doesn't have cancer the test reports that the patient doesn't have cancer so it's sort of the exact inverse of sensitivity but for the patients who don't have cancer and as as you mentioned they are connected and um you can uh game it'll help you can always push the sense to be higher if you kind of ignore the specificity so now let's go back to your clinical problem by the way max you know we've talked a little bit about lung cancer on this podcast but i can never resist the opportunity given the prevalence of lung cancer and the you know what i refer to as the loss given default meaning the severity of the disease do you want to give people just a sense of where we are today in 2022 with lung cancer is it the first or second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women it's the number one cause of cancer death which i just i think a lot of people don't realize because it doesn't get nearly as much attention at least historically as some of the other cancers that are uh maybe more common if you do just in men or just in women like breast or prostate but where actually the outcomes are much better you know we can cure a a very large fraction of patients with breast and prostate cancer of course not everyone and that is a critical area we still need to make more advances but the difference with lung cancer is that the vast majority of patients you know historically can't be cured and so that's why it is the number one uh cause of uh of death of cancer-related death so it is a major problem is that going down or going up or flat line i mean because smoking rates are coming down and about 85 of lung cancer by incidence i believe is um small cell or sorry is smoking related so some combination of smoking related 15 is in non-smokers so where do we what's the trend line on on lung cancer mortality yeah so that's one of the good news um uh in in oncology in general is both the incidence of lung cancer has has been going down in both men and women it initially uh lagged in women but it's also coming down in women now and this is all related to as you mentioned the um the uptake and then now decrease of smoking in the population so that means because there's less smoking and because smoking is such a strong risk factor for developing lung cancer it there's less lung cancer overall on top of that our treatments have gotten much better and as has now slowly the advent of screening we have a way of screening for lung cancer which is relatively recent development so those things combined have also decreased the number of patients who die from lung cancer once they get it even with all that said it still is the number one cause of uh cancer deaths but the trajectory is is good it's starting to head this way and of course we're very eager to accelerate that slope to make it uh make it even less of a of a of a problem a health problem okay or a killer of patients um it i think it is important i want to punch one other point which is often comes up in these kind of discussions which is that um while smoking is the you know by by and far far away the largest risk factor it is not the only risk factor and really anybody who has lungs can get lung cancer um and the uh you know that can happen for reasons that related to um pollution you know and that has been well described that pollution or other things in environment like radon gas that you know people are exposed to um can cause lung cancer and there's genetic associations also um for example in the asian populations there's a much larger incidence of uh non-smoking individuals who get lung cancer particularly females and so uh we're never gonna get rid of lung cancer uh just by even if we could magically make smoking go away today you know across the globe you know make all cigarettes disappear and never make a new one um there will still be lung cancer so uh let's go over kind of the distribution of how these things work out um you have small cell and non-small cell is the big division correct and then within non-small cell you have adenocarcinoma you have squamous cell carcinoma large cell and carcinoid is are those the big ones on the large cell or in the non-small cell i'm sorry that's right yeah i mean carcinoid is not considered a non-small cell uh lung cancer it's it's it's it's its own theory but um but but you're right it is one of the uh it's not a small cell so that's true still um but that's right so and the dominant the most common lung cancer isn't the non-small cell subtype of which the uh the majority have adenocarcinoma but also a significant fraction of squamous cell carcinoma and when a non-smoker gets lung cancer it's usually adenocarcinoma is that correct that's correct the vast majority of time it can sometimes be you know squamous cell carcinoma or even occasionally small cell but that is extremely rare and as you mentioned being a woman being asian seemed to elevate risk uh on the on the on the um in the case of women it seems to be potentially related to differences in estrogen testosterone that's been proposed as one plausible explanation uh do we know what genes might account for this in asians versus non uh we we do not and that's sort of one of the big mysteries um that we have not identified the main genetic drivers it they've been that's not for lack of trying of course um so um it strongly suggests that it's multifactorial right that it's one of these um as as are many of course of our chronic illnesses that have genetic components that have uh like the cardiovascular diseases for example right where it's not about a single gene the vast majority of the time it is contributions probably from multiple uh genetic variants that in aggregate elevate the risk and then there may also be of course on top of that than some further environmental factors that aren't smoking that that may then interact with that genetic background am i correct in saying i think you mentioned radon we talked about that as definitely a big environmental exposure what do we know about the sort of pm 2.5 exposure and you know i've certainly seen data that's that show that people who are in and just for folks listening so so you know particulate matter less than 2.5 micron is small enough to make its way into the most distal part of the lung there's clearly an increase in all-cause mortality associated with higher pm 2.5 exposure do we know if that's also true specifically for lung cancer is that something that we can peg to an increase in lung cancer yeah that's a great question i mean there are yeah associations of that so you know um people have looked at individuals living in cities versus rural areas and you know and correlating with the particulate contamination uh and that is also associated with more lung cancer in in in the cities that have more of the the particulate um uh in the ambient environment so there's definitely an association um in that regard you know as with epidemiologic studies uh to really prove it in a human is difficult of course but um but it does seem quite strong and there's some biological rationale for that where that if that is causing irritation and chronic inflammation those kind of things of course we know that those things are can be associated with developing cancer in many organs so it all makes sense and i think it's likely true but um there also are of course chemicals in you know in smog that you know sort of along the lines of what's in tobacco smoke similar class of of chemicals that that can be direct carcinogens do we have a sense of what the dose response curve is in in pack years of tobacco to a relative risk increase in lung cancer so you know does a person who smoked a pack a day for 10 years so they have a 10 pack year history relative to a non-smoker is that 2x the risk 50 percent more risk i mean do you have a sense of how non-linear that curve is as well versus you know the 40 40 pack your smoke or the five pack your smoker etc right um there are associations between the number of pack years and uh the risk of developing lung cancer um now a pack year is is it's not an ideal clinical variable because uh of course you can't measure it in a uh in a completely unbiased way the way just so your patients understand but when we how we figure out you know how a doctor tries to figure out how many pack years a patient has smoke meaning we basically multiply the number of years of smoking how many years they smoke for by the number of packs per day that they smoked well how do we get that information well we have to ask the patient and the reality is uh number one patients smoke different amounts of time right over there over their time number two you know they don't always remember perfectly so it's it's not a great um uh metric in that regard so the the it's difficult to really pin it down uh perfectly i have seen studies that have suggest for sure such that there isn't you know increase when you go as you go from zero to higher levels but then around 20 or 30 pack years some studies argue that then kind of plateaus that you kind of you may be sort of saturating but um they um it's that's not exactly my expertise i don't have the exact you know the slopes of those lines i don't know top of my head but um but it is not a perfect variable of course isn't it what do the data say about secondhand smoke which i would imagine is even harder to quantify than pack years but when you know for example i have some patients who grew up with parents who smoked they themselves have never smoked and let's say those parents continued to smoke all the way until those kids now adults went to college do we have a sense of how to quantify what their their smoke exposure is and should they be treated as former smokers in terms of cancer screening for example with low dose ct and things like that yeah very interesting question so yeah i agree uh it's very difficult to measure that's even harder harder to measure than the pack years we we just talked about and you know we know that cert you know certain professions that were exposed to a lot of smoking like you know waitresses and waiters or stewards and stewardesses that there was increases you know epidemiologically of course there's always other things that go along with that with that issue also so um i think the link is quite clear how you know how to quantitate it and how to know you know uh has one had enough secondhand smoke exposure that one's risk is significantly elevated i think that's a major problem actually an error would be very useful to have a biomarker that could be quantitatively measured to actually like measure like a clock of of amount of uh exposure you had we don't have such a thing um and currently that is not one of the criteria that would get a patient eligible for uh lung cancer screening by low dose ct so second smoke is not considered um the way that we decide on you know those criteria for who who should get this test and covered by insurance and who shouldn't is really about trying to enrich force you know the highest risk population you know you want at least you know a certain percent half percent of percent of risk of developing uh lung the cancer that you're going to screen for because otherwise you will screen lots and lots of patients who will never get it and then the specificity becomes a problem we talked about earlier and so that's even though there are things like you know exposure to pollutants secondhand smoke that we know increase the risk we don't then it can be frustrating enough for patients who are who are in those categories to um to know whether you know why why can't they get access to screening but there are you know sort of public health reasons for that yeah which will then get to something we'll talk about in a little bit which is you can know the sensitivity and specificity of a test but you then need to know the prevalence of the pretest probability to know how to interpret the result without the prevalence you can't impute the positive and negative predictive value which is what tells you when you have a positive how confident are you it's positive and similarly when you've been negative how confident are you there let's talk a little bit about low-dose ct because i would say this has been certainly in the last 10 years one of the major changes in how we manage lung cancer it's been about 10 years correct since uh since the data have have made the case for for the use of that as a screening technique that's right yes so that was um you know they've been a long effort in trying to develop a screening test for lung cancer given that it is the number one cause of cancer deaths um and there were a lot of failures along that road a lot of initial studies focused on doing chest x-rays when the when that was the main thing that was available so a much lower resolution way of imaging the lungs um where those studies were unable to show a benefit but then there was a landmark study called the national lung screening trial um that um proved that uh if you take the natural they took patients that randomized them either to get a low dose ct scan which is now a more high resolution way of looking at the lungs that can see smaller nodules versus getting a chest x-ray which was this technique that previously already we had kind of known that wasn't didn't work and if you do that the patients who get the low dose ct scan the high resolution imaging in that in that group there were significant lower uh rates of um lung cancer deaths i mean a relative risk reduction of about 20 percent um that um suggest you know argued that that's a major win for a screening test to actually be able to decrease the number of deaths from the disease you're screening for do you remember what the absolute risk reduction was that was small it was in the single digit percents i don't remember it off the top of my head but it was single digit percent so you you would still have an let's say it was five percent your nnt would be 20. so you would you could save a life for every 20 people that still seems pretty good it's uh it's actually lower than that you know um so maybe it was like one to two percent number need to treat is yeah it's in that yeah it's in the hundreds a hundred i think i'd say one or two hundred so maybe it's point five to one percent based on that uh argument yeah now the um that gets complicated also because um uh you'd think doing a ct scan and then you either see a nodule you don't so it should be pretty easy but of course it's not that easy a ct scan is a complicated thing to read and so how you interpret the scan and what you consider a positive will of course affect your sensitivity and specificity and will affect the number needed to treat down downstream so um the you know the way that we now read scans the low-dose ct scans is different than what the initial study did um because of a high risk of false positives if the way that they was doing the original study so um it's not you know the lowest ct is not my area of expertise um so that i don't have all the numbers at my fingertips but those are the sort of salient issues that that are in that field so even though we have this test and it is great um and is this major home run for screening because we can save you know cancer deaths um it's not a perfect test and do do you know by any chance how many millisieverts of radiation the lodo ct provides i'm guessing it's like shot you know one millisievert or less maybe i think that's right yeah i don't know that off the top of my head again because i don't do those pictures myself but it's significantly less than the the scans that we routinely do for patients who already have cancer and this is an important concern that patients have is that well you know radiation can cause cancer so why um should i uh is the risk worth it right um the risk of of the lowest cancer but it the it's called lodo ct because the amount of radiation used is much much much less than was historically done for a ct scan and so therefore the risk of causing a cancer is much much lower you know the nrc says that we shouldn't be exposed to more than 50 millisieverts in a year you know is is that sort of like saying you know you you shouldn't drink more than you know 10 drinks in a day like you have a sense of you know what would be your personal threshold for how much radiation you would want to receive a year from imaging because you're going to get radiation from you know being on airplanes although that's relatively small you know just being at sea level is probably one to two millisieverts a year if you live in colorado you probably double that um but do you ever when do you start to think about how much radiation a patient is getting from a from a practical standpoint you know do you start to worry at 20 millisieverts in a year which is obviously pretty easy to do with a pet ct scan for example right um so you know we don't routinely track that at the individual patient level and um i think that you know the way and more it's tracked in a less you know i guess systematic way in that you know we don't do imaging tests unless we feel that the the benefit of doing that test outweighs the known but really low and actually very difficult to quantitate harm right because uh you know it's actually very difficult to quantity exactly how much risk of let's say a second malignancy there future malignancy there is from a given uh protocol of a ct scan or what not just because the to get that data and uh the number of patients you'd need you could never do it randomized all those things right um and so you know the the way that medical teachers who order imaging studies which of course most or many fields in many fields they do not just radiology um uh is the the calculus is always do i need this test right will this uh help me help me manage the patient the way that's beneficial to the patient we absolutely should not be doing imaging if there's no point like if if no matter what the scan shows i'm not going to change what i'm doing right then i should not be ordering that scan it uh and there are that does come up quite frequently that they are you know you're sort of that question comes up should i image should i not and you know the way i and you know and all of us you know in this in these areas think about it is is it worth uh doing and so you know some patients who have lung cancer particularly when they get radiation therapy which is very high doses of radiation they have economical amounts of radiation that if you were not a cancer patient you would never want those amounts of radiation but the vast majorities patients will not get a cancer from their imaging or radiation treatment and their cancer if we leave it untreated will kill them right and so or if we don't catch if it's going to come back if we don't catch it early where we still might have a chance to a second chance a cure so that's how we you know we do the calculus it's not that there's you know badges bad badges that patients wear that um that track this so that um that uh and if you get to a certain point you couldn't do no more imaging it's always a sort of a case by case basis so let's go back now to the the clinical problem that is at the at the root of this whole situation which is you have a patient who has either had a resection and or radiation to follow they're clinically as we would say nad no evidence of disease but you know that the recurrence rate is there it's let's say it's 25 actuarially 25 of these of these 100 people who are currently ned are going to have a recurrence and we know that the sooner we catch the recurrence the better the odds are for treatment the lower the tumor burden the lower the burden of mutation in the patient the greater the odds of therapy so if this was 200 years ago we'd be hosed right because we'd have to wait until you know they had folating fungating masses they were coughing up blood i mean obviously that would be crazy and we've already now just put in you know great detail that look even giving high resolution ct scans at best we have to wait until a billion cells are cancerous that's the best case scenario so now we want to talk about something else so so walk us down the path of how you would or how you did think about going after another type of biopsy a liquid biopsy as i mentioned you know i was frustrated by not being able to diagnose recurrence earlier and that was an unmet need so i wanted to start you know a part of my laboratory working on that problem but to do be able to do that you know there's two ways you could think about doing that you could start with mouse models to build mouse models let's say or you know what they're called preclinical models in which you try to you know grow tumors in the animals and then see if you could you know have an idea hypothesis for what what might be good biomarker try to test that and i'll see if it works in a mouse and then ultimately go back to the human and as i mentioned earlier sort of the approach that we take in my group is more very tied to the clinic very what's called translational research and so for us really the human being is the model organism it's the final model of course it's the model we we want to get the answer for um and so i thought let's we should do this work directly on blood samples because if we find something then it likely will be directly applicable otherwise you'd always still have that second step where it works in the mouse let's say but you don't know so so i started by collecting blood samples i actually didn't know what i was going to do with them and and by the way who was funding this work at the time max was this something you went to the nih and said you know here i want an r01 and then this is why i want to study it or at the outset who who is the uh who is bearing the risk financially at the at the outset that it was basically me it's uh when you um when your new faculty member when you start a new lab when you get that first job you get what's called a startup get startup funds which is basically funds your department or university gives you provides you sort of as a to kickstart you because you don't have grants at that moment you haven't you're just starting you're having a chance to write them um and so i was using that money basically so i was footing the bill on on sort of that that pot of money i got to start my lab um because as you know and i'm sure your listeners i have heard many times that one of the things with academic research and and funding is that oftentimes you kind of have to show it already works before you can get funding for it and that's a very common story because you know grant funding is limited and so uh the organizations that fund research are often quite conservative that if the ideas sounds great but you have no proof that it works at all you know uh they're not gonna give you money so i used money that i had for my startup funds um so um so yeah so i just started collecting blood and then um i started thinking about what biomarkers might one would be good so i read the literature on the protein biomarkers as we talked earlier and sorry did you um collect blood in patients prior to resection and post resection or just post resection both always at you know prior prior to resection uh or radiation whatever the treatment was and then in subsequent follow-up visits usually you know at the time of their follow-up scans when they're coming back to see us and um so the uh the protein bond market didn't seem very useful i then spent maybe about a year looking at something called circulating tumor cells which is one subtype of what this field called liquid biopsy which is actually looking for intact cancer cells that can circulate in the blood of patients i tried that with a couple of different uh techniques um and as quickly realized you know something that many others in the field have also observed which is that while if one could really do that it would be super powerful it is very complicated to actually measure those cells for writer reasons uh the two two biggest ones probably are uh i mean three big ones are there uh the cells are not very abundant when they are there there's very few of them and they're so they're very difficult to purify like you know to actually um purif you know a good purification they might still only be one percent or less of the cells in your purified sample because it's just so hard to purify it's finding a needle in the haystack and because it's intact cells you have to process the samples really quickly you have to process them basically the same day or within an hour or two of the patients having the blood sample drawn that makes it very difficult to build up biobanks of frozen cells a frozen samples that you could you know get a large cohort you could actually study because you have to press them immediately so uh and then the last thing was that and we did some control experiments this is critical obviously you always want to you know ask is the thing i'm working on really working and where we drew blood from healthy individuals who don't have cancer you know and some of these the tumor certain tumor cell methods we're using found circulating cells those patients don't have cancer so they were picking up something else so there was a lack of specificity so they were technically complicated it seemed like it's going to be hard to get this into the clinic any time soon and there was some weakness so that's then when i went back and tried to really see what else could we do so let me go back to the first one let's just talk about the protein because that's makes sense as the obvious place to start because we already kind of do that with psa notwithstanding the limitation that normal cells normal prostate cells non-cancer cells make prostate specific antigen same with cea ca199 did you find any proteins that were made that were expressed by lung cancer cells that were unique to them we at the time did not the we did not do a holistic screen ourselves um which but other people had um which you know one can do but there's techniques now uh called mass spectrometry where one can take a sample of proteins let's say purified from the blood run them through this machine and it basically tells you what proteins were there and those studies had not found convincing markers that were unique to lung cancer cells now they found some markers that in some patients were elevated actually cea is one of them that can be elevated in lung cancer patients and one's where it is it can even be a marker of recurrence like psa can be in prostate cancer but we know we already knew that ca has problems with specificity right so um so that that that was sort of the uh the main concern um so we didn't actually do uh but the main protein work we did was actually i drew some ca and a few of these other markers like c9 some of the ones that have been previously reported to be markers and lung cancers in some of my patients because there were some studies that claimed really great performance in the literature but quickly realized that those studies were you know maybe as an artifact of that cohort or something else was going on where because we could not reproduce those results yeah let's talk about that a little bit max because that's i think what people don't understand is how difficult it can be to reproduce results and so so like help people understand what that process is like you or one of your graduate students or one of your postdocs reads a paper where somebody says hey we've identified this protein it seems really specific it looks fantastic etc etc presumably these people are collaborative you can read the paper and get the methods you can call the lab they can tell you how they did it now you do the experiment what do you find in many cases uh unfortunate one finds that one can't reproduce the result that often that can be not that it doesn't work at all but that just it doesn't work as well as it did in the initial study and um that but it works you know so much less well that it's not gonna be clinically useful that's a very common uh event now do you still publish that result max uh the the lack of validation yes you mean yeah um sometimes it depends yeah sometimes we do um often people don't um the reason uh is complex of course but one one uh issue is that um you know to definitively prove something doesn't work quite as well as as it was initially reported one actually has to do very large studies so that the what are called error bars are our estimate of the uh let's say sensitivity that's what we care about is very accurate right um but even though by doing a smaller cohort you can already tell it's not going to work out but to really ultimately prove it to the level of rigor that one you know would need for a publication would require another year of you know thousands of dollars right and so there's these you know decisions one has to make is is this really worth it what's the opportunity cost right um now but but it's interesting right when you think about it because it means that we have a bias system in the publication realm that it we are biased towards positive findings that are often untrue because let's say one person publishes that they can make this thing work okay and again we're gonna throw out fraud or anything like that but we're just gonna assume that in good faith these are people who did something but they had an artifact they didn't catch it the experiment looked like it was positive they publish it let's assume that you and four other labs independently try to reproduce it and none of you can reproduce it but you all come to the same conclusion which is well we only did it this one way and it didn't work technically i would need to do it three or four other ways to be really sure i'm going to put those resources of time and money elsewhere and away i go and everybody comes to the same logical conclusion but of course that means that that one finding gets disproportionately propagated as a positive finding when in reality four labs have now found it to be highly unlikely and that doesn't get published of course i'm not being critical of you or anybody max other than just the system which is i wish there was a way that the incentive structure could be such that we prioritize negative findings as much as positive findings right and i agree with you 100 percent um and um as you laid it out is true and that does happen and in general you know we don't have a system where one lab could know that three other labs have done the same thing you know maybe eventually you find out over dinner at a conference or something right but um but how would you because there is no um place to go to look up to say what other people have done um the uh there is no way to know right uh so um it is it is a problem i i it would be great if we could fix it it's a very difficult problem of course because of the the the many factors and including the economic parts of limited research uh resources and time and like even you know to publish such a study would take let's say a grad students could still take six months of their time to get that out but now you know they're not spending those six months on on on their main project which is you know to develop the new test right so it there are so many uh reasons why why this happens right and and i've spoken with graduate students who will say look it's really going to be harder for me to get my phd publishing negative studies i mean i'm going to quickly turn my attention to where i think my committee is going to be looking at me more favorably so yeah i think i think the problem is pretty significant but there's a selection bias for it if the selection pies of the pause result is a major issue and so this this is why reproducing positive results is so critical uh and something that also not everyone likes to do it because reproducing something someone else already did is not making a brand new discovery right but that is critical that is you know and that's one thing i would say particularly in the more in the medical fields we do do quite a bit of right there is quite a bit of studies that sort of try to reproduce um results pause results and then publish it when the results are also positive and that's really to really prove something works you know to convince convincingly uh convince yourself that something is really real it's really helpful to see multiple studies from multiple groups i deal with multiple methods that find the same thing and that you know that's sort of how you can read read through the literature and really try to see where where is likely a robust finding all right so let's go to the ctcs now so protein out circulating tumor cells okay so talk to me about a patient who shows up with a big juicy stage two lung cancer prior to resection how many milliliters of blood do you take out of that patient preoperatively so that depends greatly but you know the um these kind of tests whether whether we're doing them for research purposes or ultimately you know if you were to develop something for the clinic usually take somewhere between 10 to 20 ml of blood so a few tablespoons so right out of the gate how many ctcs do you see preoperatively when you should be at your highest right that should be your greatest circulating tumor bird so in stage one to two non-small cell most often zero oh my god so yeah so that's um so that and that that was what we found when we looked um and so the that meant the sensitivity isn't very good right as a control did you have positive controls of stage four patients we did and we did see some patients where we saw quite a lot so you can definitely see patients that have massive amounts occasionally you even see early stage patients that have quite a lot and this is work not that we didn't didn't we we didn't do but other another group in the uh field uh led by carolyn dive from mr manchester where they actually took blood from the draining veins at the time of the surgery the lobectomy for lung cancer and did circling tumor cell assays and found evidence that there they could find more signals energy was better in that context because the hypothesis being that you're basically measuring the blood outflow of the tumor right so you're going to catch more cells that way because once they hit the systemic circulation they're getting diluted all you know over the entire body um so there is some evidence along those lines any findings about the differences in those early stage so if you if you took a person with stage two cancer who is your typical patient who has no circulating tumors even preoperatively but then you said there might be some who had a reasonably high burden does that predict who's going to recur even though based on tnm staging they're both considered identical postoperatively right and so yeah absolutely there's there is evidence of that there are studies that have shown that that when you when you do see high levels that that is a negative prognostic marker a bad thing and that those patients are at higher risk of recurrence now one complication in the ctc field the certain tumor cell field in general is that as i mentioned even non-cancer patients can have circulating cells that look like circulating tumor cells using the markers that are generally used which are usually when you know when it's looking for certain tumor cells most assays uh look use uh stain the cells meaning they they look for markers on the cells uh and they want the cells to not express markers from lymphocytes from white blood cells so there's a marker you know that's highly expressed on white blood cells that should not be expressed on the circling tumor cell which which one do you use cd3 people usually use cd45 is the most common marker which is sort of a pan white blood cell marker and then for um on the flip side for a positive marker what is should be expressed in the cancer cell but not the white blood cells um they look for things like cytokeratins which are those you know structural proteins that that are specific to epithelial cells um but as we and others have found healthy patients can also have cells that have cytokeratin expression but no white blood cell marker expression in the circulation and other people have gone further to do single cell sequencing of those to show that their genomes are actually normal those cells have normal genomes they're not mutated like the cancer cells are so it definitely appears that there can be epithelial cells circulating in us that are not cancer cells and very likely they you know those cells can't divide forever so they will not ever set up shop anywhere there's not very many of them but that makes it complicated to re you know look for the presence of certain tumor cells if one doesn't have a very specific way of getting of removing that signal yeah so that right away tells you this is never going to be at least that exact approach can never be a cancer screening tool and it makes you worry that even in patients who are without disease but who have been resected it might not be a great predictor of disease recurrence so far the only thing that sounds somewhat promising from this approach is it might help you determine the course of adjuvant therapy in a patient correct so if you took a patient who was resected radiated stage two had high circulating tumor burden versus one who didn't you might take that former patient and say even though the textbook says you don't need chemotherapy we're actually going to give you chemotherapy because we're going to treat you like you're stage three or worse right and that that's absolutely where we wanted to get that was that exact situation one of the main motivations for starting liquid biopsy work in my lab and yes with very high levels of certain tumor cells one could have envisioned if one were to do a very large studies to predefinitely prove that these are patients with a certain threshold even though they're a small minority if that is really very highly associated with recurrence that that that could work but it would miss most patients who ultimately developed recurrence and so that that was the negative and again it's not to say in the future we might not get there there's lots of work still going on this in this circling tumor cell field so i don't i don't want to um be too negative about it it's just not uh as far along as the thing that we ultimately suddenly will talk about shortly but um the um and more development is required if we're going to be able to use that clinically all right so then where where would you go where did you go next did you look at cell free dna yes so the next after that we went to what's called cell free dna which refers to dna molecules that are found in the circulation but outside of cells so they're circulating in what's called the blood plasma which is the the non-cellular liquid portion of the blood um and it's called cell-free because it's outside of cells free of cells of course it comes from cells originally but it's now circulating by itself without membranes around it and the reason i got interested in that was actually largely from reading about a different field which is prenatal diagnostics where around this time there were uh there was a lot of work being done led by a number of individuals like dennis lowe in hong kong and steve quake who was actually here at stanford in the engineering department basically showing that in pregnant mothers you can detect dna from the fetus in the woman's blood cell free dna again not not inside cells but outside of cells so it's pretty obvious that i mean i was the only person who had this thought that about if we can do that in pregnancy then you know couldn't we try to do the same thing in cancer patients and just to be clear max when you spin this down when you when you take a tube of blood and you spin it you get all of the uh cellular matter below the buffy coat and then the plasma is above is the cell-free dna in the clear plasma and not stuck within the cellular material it manages to that's okay correct so the the software dna is uh in the plasma and that's exactly where we isolated uh and that's actually a critical technical yeah because if it were in the cellular matter it would be a disaster to find it you can't get it right and it actually i we've thought about this idea that i think it's actually quite insightful idea you have there could there be more suffering dna mixed in with the cellular compartment and i think i'd like it if you could put a gradient on that and try to somehow extract it yeah get it out that you might be able to get enrich yourself free yeah you can enrich for it again uh and that might actually be a future interesting research direction but the um the problem is currently if you were to just take some of that cellular compartment there's some vastly more dna in the cells than there is in the cell free space um that um you uh you would basically lose the signal you would just have all you know the vast vast majorities from cells in the compartment so we we take the the aqueous part the the plasma part at the top of the tube after you spin it and there's very low levels you know it's only about um on a healthy individual about one to five nanograms per mil uh of of cell free dna in in the plasma by the way you know what's interesting i have beta thalassemia minor so my phenotype is normal well i shouldn't say that my hemoglobin hematocrit are normal but my phenotype is that i have very small rbcs so my my mcv is you know in the 50s or 60s or something like that right and my rbc count is very high so that's how i have a normal hematocrit because i have a lot of small red blood cells so so our mutual classmate from med school matt mccormick who was my roommate used to always refer to me as heaven shite for blood and i just learned something very recently i've al i've spun my blood a billion times i've been more times than i can count and i've always thought man i must be dehydrated man i must be dehydrated because relative to everybody else's blood you know you'll get cellular matter this much buffy coat plasma they're about the same volume and you can even estimate hematocrit by spinning in a lavender top and looking at the separation well you can't do any of that in my blood because my plasma volume is tiny and my cellular fraction is enormous and i've and so finally i spoke to a hematologist who said oh the reason is because you have all those little crappy red blood cells they're actually keeping and trapping a lot of the plasma within the cellular body at the bottom so it's not that you don't have a normal plasma volume you do but you just can't get it out of the separation which means i'd be a lousy patient for this because i'm cutting my sample size down so much by reducing my plasma volume so you might have to donate larger amounts of blood to get the the right amount of plasma but yeah i think that's a very interesting observation i think it kind of does suggest that this phenomenon of their potentially being trafficking dna among the cells yeah is probably you know also you know happening you're the exceptional outlier but it's probably also happening in the average patient to a lesser extent now again it's dna so just to make sure everybody remembers this is a double-stranded or single-stranded dna these are largely double-stranded dnas we think um and haven't done you know we know those have done some experiments along those lines these are a double-stranded dna molecules they are rather short the cell-free dna molecules uh how many uh there is yeah basis yeah it's about 170 bases okay 160 570 and it's that's exact actually exactly the length of dna um that is um you would expect if the dna were wrapped around the core histones histones of course are for your listeners are proteins that that uh package the dna in our cells they're they're sort of the scaffold and that lets the dna which if it were linearly stretched out would be extremely long fit into the compact nucleus of a 10 micron cell it has this special packaging uh scaffold which is consists of the histones and so uh the dna in the circulation uh is wrapped still around this core histones and we think that's in critical because there's actually high activity of enzymes that chew up dna uh in in our in our blood in our extracellular fluid um and so the dna is only there temporarily and it's temporarily protected by these histones so the dna that's bound to the histones is present at a higher frequency in the blood than the dna that's between the histones the histones are like pearls on a string and the dna regions that are between the between two pearls are relatively depleted from the blood because these enzymes are chewing up the dna constantly which is what contributes to these very low levels of dna because of course we have lots of cell death so you might imagine we should have higher levels of dna in the body in our blood but there's we have a system to clear it out in this dna's enzyme and probably important because um if you ever work with dna if you get high concentrations of it it becomes very sticky kind of a snot-like substance which would be very uh probably bad to have in your microvasculature um you know for stroke etc and and so does does this cell-free dna primarily come via apoptosis or what is the predominant method by which or or mechanism by which the cells are evicting their dna that is very poorly understood that's a great question it's still one of the mysteries and it's a mystery because it's really difficult to study because the um in a human being or even an animal what we know is that most if not all tissues contribute dna to the cell free dna pool uh and so there is um you know it's coming from everywhere so it's very difficult to to study release of something from everywhere right it is um because it is you know chopped up uh in these small histone-bound fragments there was historically a lot of you know most of the reviews and textbooks would argue that it's largely apoptosis that does that because in apoptosis of course there is a laddering of the dna or chopping up of the dna maybe tell folks tell folks what apoptosis is so they know what we're yeah great apoptosis is a mode of cell death so how cells in our bodies can die but is a it is a controlled programmed cell death meaning that there is a mechanism in our cells that is basically a suicide program that can get activated um this is critical for development our development because at certain points as we're developing from a you know the fertilized egg up to a full infant and even then you know during uh later in life um cells sometimes have to get killed so to make room for other cells and that's just part of our normal pro normal developmental homeostasis um so it's something that we have evolutionarily built uh it also is critical for getting rid of sick cells because some of the cell gets sick uh there has to be a way of killing it so apoptosis is a programmed way of cells dying and as part of that once that's activated the cells um chop up their um proteins as well as their dna basically it's sort of to make it sort of a tight kind of clean up after themselves in a way um but because of this chopping up the dna that happens during apoptosis it was long thought that that likely could be a major mechanism i think it still could be that the complicating factor is now we have a much better understanding that there's also dnases just floating in the plasma that are also chopping up dna so over a long chunk of dna we're released through a non-apoptosis process it would likely also become chopped up and so you know we can't do just because it's chopped up assume it comes from apoptosis so we don't know for sure i think that's an important area of research we think it's likely multifactorial apoptosis necrosis you know basically any way that a cell can die and release some of its contents into the blood okay so let's say we're talking about a normal person you've taken 10cc of blood you you take the plasma from them how do you quantify how much cell-free dna you would expect to get out of that and then furthermore how are you distinguishing what is potentially cell-free dna from a normal cell which presumably is the bulk of it versus cell-free dna that is from the cell of interest the cancer cell right so once we purify the dna once we have the plasma so the non-cellular compartment there is um laboratory procedures for isolating dna that have been you know well worked out for over many decades that we use in all different fields of biology and so we apply some methods there that have been optimized for these low concentrations of dna that's one of the unique things about the sulfur dna work the concentration is really low like i said you know one single digit nanograms per mil and often when we do laboratory procedures we like to work with at least micrograms of dna so there's nanograms it's a small amount that was one of the challenges early on in the field to try to overcome that so we purify the dna and then we can quantify how much there is there's a variety of laboratory tools we have the most commonly used one in our lab is a fluorescent-based method where you basically add a fluorescent dye to to the solution it binds to dna and that gives a specific fluorescence and then you can read that out in a in a machine that can read that fluorescence so you can then have this and have a standard curve and read off how much dna you have and again like i have like so in su hybridization or no it's uh this is just purely a dye based method it's much simpler than that you could do you could do some you could do more complicated things you know probably the next most the more complicated thing that we would do next when we do sometimes in certain situations is what's called quantitative pcr where basically you uh you use a an enzymatic method that can amplify dna um and you again have a standard curve where you know how much dna is in there and you compare how the amplification curves grow and that can let you read out how much dna was in your sample but most of the time we can use this more simple method which just add a die put in the machine get your result it's it's very fast and just give me some quantity so in 10 ml of plasma how many nanograms would you expect or how many what how many nanograms per milliliter in any sample would you expect to have of cell free dna right so 10 mls of plasma would be 20 mls of blood we collect because of plasma in most individuals is about half right so that from 20 mls of blood we get 10 ml of plasma those 10 mls in healthy individuals would have somewhere between one to five nanograms per ml so that would mean 10 to 50 nanograms of dna at the end and but in some conditions in some advanced cancer patients patients who have trauma have an infection the levels can be much higher much higher than five nanograms per ml because there's active cell death happening in the body and so when that happens we sometimes see levels you know in the you know hundreds of nanograms per ml that's rare but we it can happen so now the big question is how do you separate the good actor and the bad actor in that pile the way that we and others in the field do that is to focus on a unique molecular property of cancer cells that normal cells generally don't have and that is the mutations that cause the cancer of course as many of your listeners will know cancer is a is a disease that is caused by mutation mistakes in the dna of a normal cell that accumulate and ultimately lead to that cell not being responsive to cues to stop growing or to or to kill itself and just to grow uncontrollably and so then those mutations both the ones that cause the cancer as well as many thousands that are long for the ride in most tumors are serve as really exquisitely specific markers of the cancer cell because these mutations are really only present in the cancer cells not in the patient's normal cells so this is a really attractive biomarker and for a variety of reasons one is you're tracking the cause of the disease right you're really the molecular cause of this is a mutation that is what you're tracking what better biomarker can there be for an illness right you're actually tracking that and the second thing is the specificity particularly when you compare it to the proteins where as we mentioned like psa can be made by normal prostate cells and by prostate cancer cells but the mutations in a prostate cancer would not be present in the normal prostate cells they would be present in the cancer cells so how do we tell then if there's circulating intermediate present is that we look for mutations in these short dna molecules so we look for mutant molecules uh most of the molecules in the blood come from the healthy cells of the patient and they don't have mutations but a small subset and that can be you know range from you know in advance an advanced lung cancer patient might have one percent of the circulating dnas from is from the cancer so still a small amount it's still you know relatively small that's that's high levels in early stage patients it's often well less than you know 0.01 or 0.001 percent of the dna that that's from the cancer so how do you even detect that without i mean do you have the resolution to detect 0.1 of the cell-free fraction which itself is already very small and know that you're not seeing an artifact yeah so that's and that was the challenge uh in in you know in in the field when we started is that's not trivial it's actually extremely difficult as you suggest um the reason is that um uh the methods we use to try to detect mutations and there's a variety of them um but the one that we chose to use in which the basically the vast majority of the field has moved to since as well is next generation sequencing which is these high throughput molecular methods for sequencing dna where you can identify the actual sequence of the bases the agtc bases that make up the dna you can get the exact sequence for hundreds of millions of molecules or billions of molecules even in parallel in one experiment um so we use those tools because we can just read that it's like we could like we have a it's as if we had a microscope that's so good that we can just read off the bases it's not a microscope it's a complex molecular biology procedure but the end result is the same we could we get a data set of millions of dna sequences that are all about 170 bases in length and we can then compare those sequences to the patient's germline dna let's say that we purify from a buccal swab or from the cellular comportment compartment of the blood and we can say the vast majority of the molecules look identical to the patient's germline meaning their normal healthy cell dna but some small proportion of this of the molecules have mutations and in many of our experiments the way that we can be very certain that's the case is because we start by actually sequencing the tumor so let's say particularly for this initial problem we had of telling who is cured or not if you sequence those patients all have treatment they're all known to have cancer so we have a piece of their tumor we can sequence that and identify what mutations that tumor has compared to the patient's healthy cells let's say we find you know in a particular panel we might be using let's say we find 10 just for the sake of example so 10 mutations the patient's tumor has that the healthy cells don't we can then go look in the blood in the sequencing dataset we have for those molecules that carry the one of those 10 mutations and that turns out to be exquisitely specific and sensitive for the presence of the cancer if we see even one or a handful of molecules that carry the mutation one of these mutations has worn out that that basically means there's still cancer cells in the body now the other thing that i want to make sure i understand here is we're talking about relatively short fragments of dna you said 100 call it 150 bases correct yeah 170 maybe closer to 170. 99.9 of all of that cell free dna lines up to some segment of their germ line but no two of those are the same either right so it's like if you could lay their entire germline genome out it would you know span miles and miles and miles you probably have no two segments that are the exact same so you have a whole bunch of 170 base segments that line up somewhere on that problem that's a pretty interesting computational problem to me because 170 is not that big presumably some of that 170 also is present in the cancerous in the mutated yeah the vast majority the vast majority right a cancer the cancer is only going to have maybe a hundred mutations yeah so a hundred mutation in the coding regions exactly that's right in the coding regions in the total genome if you include the the regions between genes may be you know 10 to 20 000 or something it depends of course as a range but no more than ten having more than tens of thousands of mutations in the whole genome would be unusual yeah so i guess what strikes me is almost improbable is given the few number of mutations that really exist in the cancer if only 0.1 percent of the entire cell-free dna which itself are very short segments it seems to me you could very easily just miss it right you wouldn't happen to find a segment that lines up with a mutation right presumably there must be a way to do the i mean i feel like if you gave me an hour i could figure out the numbers like it's just it's just a statistics and probability problem but so how infrequent is that so um that is exactly one of the major challenges in the field um and um that's actually our initial you know when we our first paper in this field uh that started really this whole part of my laboratory back in 2014 we had we addressed that problem so what there of course had been some prior work in uh self-redeeming cancer prior to us you know one is always building on the shoulders of former uh researchers when one does the next project you know maybe just for a brief history lesson you know mid of last century was the first observation that there is cell free dna present by a french group and they even uh they had very very in insensitive methods back then of course uh so they could only tell it see it in some very very advanced cancer patients but they even then they were already at the foresight to say well this could be potentially useful but then for the intervening i don't know 50 60 years there wasn't that much progress because of this hurdle of there being so little of it and the methods just not being there to measure it and what people had been starting to doing around you know sort of the memory or mid or 2005 2010 in that range was to actually look use very sensitive pcr methods to look for single mutations let's say you know the patient has a p23 mutation you go looking for that pd3 mutation and so that they weren't ever that time than methods that could do that more sensitively but that ran into the problem that you mentioned which is that well now you're looking for one mutation but often there's less than a cancer genome present in the blood tube and so you just i can you have lots of negative samples just because that mutation isn't there it's not in the blood draw you took so the way that we overcame that was actually fairly very simple which is just to say well let's use this next generation sequencing technology where we can look you know get sequence from millions of molecules and instead of looking for a single mutation let's look for dozens of mutations from the patient's cancer in parallel so compared to looking for one mutation looking for 10 actually increases your sensitivity 10-fold by a whole order of magnitude because i don't have to see all 10 mutations to know the cancer is still there if i you know the mutations are specific i just need to see one of the tests and you don't care if they're coding or non-coding correct that's true we don't care if they're coding or non-coding and we've successfully used both but you what you what is help beneficial is to have what's called a truncal or clonal mutation meaning a mutation that's present in every cancer cell so as you know cancer develops as we talked about earlier by acquisition of mutations now the cell starts healthy it gets the first mutation and then ultimately gets to be a cancer which has tens of thousands of mutations those happen uh over time right years generally um many of those mutations are present many of the 10 000 are actually present in all cells of the tumor even though they're not driving the cancer just because it's the history the the evolutionary memory of that cancer right that the cell that ultimately was able to continuously divide has already had these ten thousand mutations from the precursor process and so once it then gets the final mutation that lets it divide forever it keeps all those to other ten thousand mutations so we don't care we just want the mutation to be present in all the cells yeah and it's interesting because driver mutations have surprising heterogeneity right i mean i was actually talking to steve rosenberg about this on the podcast last year and i was amazed at the non-overlap of driver mutations um and so yeah a lot of people had p53 but it wasn't necessarily the driver so it was it was it was present um and also i mean this gets it back into your other thing that you're interested in which is the immunology is how often it was not the not a mutation that was antigen um inducing but uh that was yeah that was bringing responsibility so so let's now talk about is there such a thing as cell-free rna or is that just so unstable that it's not even worth thinking about and is is cell-free dna the only place to be thinking about uh this no absolutely not there there is such a thing as cell free rna that field is much more nascent than the than the dna field what advantages would it offer given the instability of the molecule i think there's some critical questions initially about what is the stability of the molecule you know how much of it is there uh and how stable is it and then you miss the non-coding mutations as well right well yeah you would there you can if you're looking for mutations i don't think it has advantages really um it's but it you can do other things right so like the v my vision is that ultimately we want to get to the point where we can from a blood draw determine as much as possible about a patient's cancer ideally eventually to the point where we don't even need to biopsy it now that is science fiction uh currently right um but if you extend the line of work uh you know decades into the future that is where we're trying to get uh and that means we have to be able if we want to get there we have to be able to measure things other than mutations mutations are important they're critical but they're only a small part of the puzzle measuring rna could tell you about which genes are on and off in the cancer theoretically and so that is critically important for example for in the immunotherapy field that you mentioned you know we know there's some markers like uh pdl1 that can be expressed in the tumor cells that can basically hide the cancer from the immune system that marker is that's not a mutational process in the vast majority of patients it is it's expressed uh from the promoter like you know just turned on for you know reasons having to do with signaling epigenetic reasons etc and so you can't tell by looking at the sequence in dna of pdl-1 whether the tumor is has this marker it's not a mutation marker so we'd like to be able to measure something like that from the blood we'd like to be able to tell the difference between an ad and a carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma orbiting a lung cancer and a breast cancer from the blood and some of those things you can do with dna potentially but a lot of them you can't and they might be better done with rna so it's absolutely it's a fascinating area my group is working in this area um we haven't uh published uh our work but um we will hopefully soon and we have some exciting primary results i think i think in the future rna will be a big part of the liquid biopsy puzzle that doesn't replace dna it just it has it offers complementary pieces of information that you can't get from dna now is there a difference between cell-free dna and circulating tumor dna sometimes i've heard people use those interchangeably are they are they interchangeable or is there a distinction they are different generally cell free dna refers to the total amount the total dna in the circulation that includes both the healthy cell the derived dna and the cancer cell derived dna and circulating the tumor is just the sub fraction yes that's the portion that one percent that's from the or whatever that's from the tumor exactly so um that that that that's the difference in the terminology and then are there any other signatures that can be helpful here for example looking at methylation patterns on the dna can that be informative at all absolutely yep so meth dna methylation is refers to a chemical modification of the dna molecules so again we have these about 170 base pair molecules in the circulation and at certain of the the nucleotides there can be chemical modifications that are put on by enzymes particularly a methylation by methyl group which is a chemical chemical group and that is put on not the same in every cell different cells based on largely what tissue they're from have different patterns of this methylation and it has to do because these methylation marks these chemical modifications can influence which genes are turned on and off so you could envision that in a lung cancer that needs you know the genes to the lung cell that needs genes for surfactant production or making alveoli or whatever needs those genes on but it doesn't need the genes on that you know of an adipose a fat cell to make fat because it's not doing that so they might be methylated and some some some genes are methylated and turn on or off in different cells in different ways so they can be more exquisite marks of the origin of the dna and so there's been a lot of work in the last couple of years looking at methylation marks to to do that and it has some potential advantages because unlike mutations um you know they're it's actually much more stereotyped so a lung the methylation of a lung cancer of two lung cancers is more similar than their mutation profile so in other words you can use the mutations to identify and distinguish between tumor and non-tumor and you use the methylation to hopefully zero in on tissue of origin for you could for example yes exactly if you were using maybe even screen yeah for screening purposes exactly which is a little it's a different uh scenario than this initial scenario of saying i have a patient who i've treated with surgery or radiation i want to know if they're cured now i think an important thing to recognize is that the sensitivity of the methylation-based approaches is significantly inferior to that of the mutation-based approaches which but from a practical standpoint the methylation approaches have some advantages for the screening question but the sensitivity and the practicality aren't aligned because you'd i really you'd want the most sensitive assay possible for screening right yes um because the tumors are tiny but that is not the current state in the field is that the mutation based methods are much more sensitive so we recently published a paper and a new method a new method that's part of our third generation mutation based method that's about a hundred times more sensitive than our prior methods as well as other you know methods in the field we would that can now get down to uh one part in a million uh so we can detect you know maybe with the prior methods we're kind of bottoming out at about 0.01 percent the prime mutation based method around .01 percent of one in ten thousand this new method can get to one in a million so it's you know that's what two log imperatives yeah two log improvements so that's you know a log improvement is a dramatic of course uh improvement in a diagnostic assay and so um with that assay we have you know now with lots of patients where we had sample left over so we could use our first gen assay and now come to this new assay and we had false negatives with the first geneticity that now we can pick up with this newer method saying that it's not that they didn't have any it wasn't that there was no ctdna there was circulating tumor dna it just was not at the level that the prior generation could detect so that one it you know we're about a one in a million with the methylation-based assays it's actually the data is still not very mature to know exactly what their sensitivity is but as the put you know putting the data in literature as well as some of our own experiments it's probably closer to one one in a thousand it's a point one percent now of course to be clear with the mutation the advantage what makes the mutation based method so much more sensitive is you know what you're looking for you have the mutation a priori in the in the methylation method you don't right so you you if you're doing a pan screen for someone who doesn't have cancer by definition you can't know what mutations to look for um that's right so how does that gap get closed because if you look at a test like grail for example so grail is i believe looking at exactly this method right they're using i think they're looking at methylation patterns of cell-free dna but they're doing it as a pan screen so it's give me 10 20 ml of blood and we're just going to look for all the cell free dna we're going to identify if there's cancer or non-cancer in there if there is cancer in there we're going to try to predict the tissue of origin how good can that get because right now the sensitivity for all stages is probably 50 percent with a specificity of about 99 it's above 99 but if you look at stage one right if you're really trying to catch an early cancer we're talking about a sensitivity of maybe 20 right right so this gets into a very interesting part of this this the diagnostic field in general particularly this liquid biopsy field with regards to early detection which is how results are uh are presented and you put your finger on it we care about sensitivity and specificity we want specificity very high 95 99 something in that ballpark and we want high sensitivity now um when uh studies report sensitivity across stages i have an issue with the way that when that is done because it is you can easily bias that by just including more stage four patients right you could include one stage one patient and 999 stage four patients and say i have sensitivity of blah from stage one to four yeah uh so i it's i think what you did in this as you laid it out it's important to break it down by stage and actually even within stage one it should be broken down because when you for like a lung cancer let's say we break stage one into stage one a stage one b uh and even stage one a one stage one a two stage one so it gets very granular uh and that all relates to small and smaller tumors that have better and better outcome that are the ones you want to catch and so in lung cancer actually the sensitivity for stage one lung cancer in the grail day that's been presented is actually you know five percent or less okay so let's make sure people understand the math on that if it's bigger than stage one you don't need a liquid biopsy you can do a low dose ct and you'll see it right but in theory the only reason you'd care about a liquid biopsy is if we're talking about fewer than a billion cells that's true i mean if if if you had a patient you could do either test that's true there are some potential advantages of the blood-based test as a way of getting more patients screened i think there are some practical reasons why you could argue uh let's say they were um yeah if people have less access to care and access right now it's like it's the advantage to get the scan yeah fair enough okay but but let's just say let's i want to make sure people understand the following if a test has and this is going to be i think amazing for people 50 sensitivity 99.5 specificity if you said that that was your stage one performance in an unbiased sample i think people would be like wow that's pretty good i mean for people who don't have cancer for who for whom we believe don't have cancer in whom we don't have any mutational information i have a test that is 50 sensitive and 99.5 specific do the test okay here's how i explain this to my patients what is the pre-test probability that you have cancer so if you're one of my patients and you're 45 years old and you're not a smoker and your family history is relatively normal and oh by the way your colonoscopy is negative in other words your pre-test probability is one percent so you go and i encourage everybody to do this and for the show notes we're going to include my calculator so i built a little calculator but there are apps that do this i just do it in excel but you can download an app that will allow you to do this you plug in sensitivity specificity and prevalence and it will spit out positive and negative predictive value well if you use the numbers i just gave you 55 99 and a half of specificity one percent on the prevalence if my memory serves me correctly your negative predictive value is like you know goes to 99.7 or something or it goes from you know let's just say you put in 99 specificity it goes to 99.5 negative predictive value and they say well that's really good isn't it and i say yeah but it's only a little bit better than what it was at the outset your pre-test probability was 99 negative i just took you from 99 negative 1099.5 negative and by the way your positive predictive value is 40 percent so if i get a positive test in you it's more likely than not a false positive and so i don't want to be the guy that's raining on the parade because we are using these tests in our patients but never in isolation and i just i guess the question that's that's a lot i loaded into that so feel free to comment on any and all of it but where i want to go with this max is without the mutational information that makes the type of testing you're doing in patients with known cancers so sensitive how can we make these things more than a parlor trick in um patients who don't have cancer at least at the surface excellent point yeah you you laid out some things that i often do in my my talks as i talk uh about these things um this is something that's even not well understood not just by patients but by a lot of researchers and physicians this issue that um something that you know sounds great 50 sensitivity 99 specificity even ignoring for the fact that the stage one sensitivity is actually less than five percent but just let's just say on the surface the 50 percent where it's where we're at um that if you already basically have no risk of uncancer you're you know less than one percent chance of having cancer the test isn't moving really moving the needle for you significantly and uh has a high risk of catching um false positives as you mentioned because the positive predictive value isn't so good um and that leads to lots of further testing anxiety often we can't find anything but then patients are worried for years that is there something brewing is it just the next scan will show it or the next time and um so i have lots of concerns about that i'm i'm one of the researchers that's really focusing on this field and and i very much see these issues and um am concerned about them um i this is why i really strongly feel that we as the field need to ultimately really do studies that prove cancer-specific survival benefits of these tests and that is currently not really on the roadmap the the the commercial efforts uh which there are of which are many uh are largely they're not planning on doing this large these large randomized trials like the ldc lotus ct study we showed we talked about earlier that proved that that you save lives from lung cancer why not well they're expensive and take years right and so it's not attractive from an investment standpoint but if we really want to be sure that we are helping our patients and we're not just adding costs to the healthcare system that's what we have to do and in we don't know if the sensitivity as of the best tests as they currently are are good enough to save lives and there's multiple reasons for that but an important reason is that uh it gets very complicated but even beyond okay we already said you got to look at by stage because by saying across all stages doesn't is meaningless because you can game that even within stage one you gotta look by stage one a one one eight two one a three but even once you're at that point it gets even more complicated because there's actually really let's say we have stage one lung cancer patients there's two types of stage one lung cancer patients the stage one lung cancer patients where the cancer cells have not left the lung there's that's where they are that's the only place they are and the surgeon removes the tumor and the patient is cured that's one type of stage one lung cancer patient the second type of stage one on cancer patient looks the same has exact same ct scan has the same surgery but already has microscopic cells in the liver and the brain that we don't know about their stage one we call them stage one because that's all we can see but so stage one is actually heterogeneous there's two subtypes of it and in order for a screening test to be useful it has to catch a significant fraction of the first type of stage one the stage one that doesn't have micro metastases because which the surgeon can cure because i think what's implicit in your comment max is that the surgeon's not gonna cure the sec the second one good point yes so the surgeon can cure what he can see or she can see right what what they can cut out but they if there's micrometastatic metastases in the liver in the brain the surgeon isn't cutting those areas because they don't know about them um and so those will eventually grow back and so that is why simply saying a test um increases the number of patients diagnosed at earlier stages doesn't automatically prove that that test will save lives because it when you look at the very granular level you and you consider this issue about that there being different kinds of stage one patients um you know you can envision a test that mainly catches the patient with micrometastatic disease and actually we have hints that the the ctdna assays preferentially catch those patients because of the things we talked about the beginning with there being now you know lots of microscopic deposits spread throughout the body if you were to put those all into one place and add them up you would have many billions of cells therefore overall you have more circulating tumor dna but and you can detect it but you think there's stage one because that's all you can see on the scan so how do we ever how do we prove that the tests are not you know falling into that pitfall is we have to do randomized studies that's the only way we can we can prove it and so that that's something to me that's a major concern and there's this push and pull about well these are great tests they're very promising and obviously i wouldn't work on it if i didn't think ultimately these will save lives but um so can we should we withhold them from patients right if they are from non-cancer patients especially yeah from not getting a patient yeah non-conservative should we withhold if we all have the tests okay we don't know yet if they're going to save lives but isn't it unethical to not give them because you know if we later find out if you're ten years from now or five years from now find out they save lives now there's five years of patience who didn't have the benefit that is an argument that's often put forward you know the problem with that argument which is why ethically it sounds of course very reasonable is that if by that argument we we would never test anything new that we develop in medicine because there's always a possibility that that thing could improve right things well and that's i think why the fda has taken the posture because right now there are only four approved liquid biopsies right uh garden and three others yeah yeah garden there's some some academic uh assays as well like the morocco killing platform but those are for very different things right those are for genotyping something we haven't really talked about those are for identifying what mutations are present in patients with advanced disease that's what those tests are yeah so let's actually talk about that let's talk tell folks what garden does and and you know it's an fda approved uh diagnostic but explain to people what it's used for because i get asked this question all the time so the garden assay uh and they're one of the first companies in this field they use a very similar method to what we use a next-generation sequencing to measure circling tumor dna but the test that they the initial test the one that's approved was developed for a very specific clinical problem you have a patient with metastatic cancer let's say lung cancer you know multiple parts of the body and you want to identify what mutations that patient has because in lung cancer we have drugs that work for patients with certain treatments based on mutations yeah exactly it's it's what we call actionable if we know what the mutation is and if we have a drug for it that's the first thing we should treat the patient with historically we always have to do a biopsy or surgery to get the piece of the tissue to to identify the mutations what we've we you know the field garden we others have shown is that you don't in many patients with advanced disease because like say one percent of the circling tumor dna is from the cancer if that's enough that you can identify the mutations without needing to do the biopsy so that's potentially very useful particularly in patients who can't have a biopsy or where they had a biopsy but the whole all the tissue was used up there's lots of cases like this um and um or where the biopsy missed the tumor that happens a lot as you as you know or a certain subset of the time so uh in those cases it can be super useful to have a blood test to say oh yeah this patient does have an egfr mutation so they should get on the egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor that's what those tests were developed for now that is the easiest problem in the liquid biopsy space because you're in stage four patients that are known to have cancer high tumor burden and so those tests are optimized for that they work well for that they have good agreement 80 a high 80 agreement with biopsy they can sometimes find mutations that the biopsy misses because of technical issues with the biopsy as i mentioned so they have they're good tests for that for that problem they are not designed for number one early cancer screening or detection where the levels of circumference day are many logs lower and they're not designed for this question of is the patient cured or not after treatment again where the levels are much lower they are designed for this one thing and um and that's very important to recognize that we you can't that test if you know if you were to go to the doctor and say you know i i want to test to see whether i'm cured or not that those fda approved tests don't do that is that true of is it cell search and foundation one there are a couple of the others that are approved right correct yeah uh yeah foundation has a liquid biopsy test um that's basically it's very similar again technology similar to what we developed in garden and they do the same thing now cell search is actually a circling tumor cell assay uh that is fda approved actually was that was approved before any circulating tumor dna assay and you know we talked about certain tumor cells at the beginning they at the very beginning of the lipid biopsy field like in the early 2000s that was the focus they were everyone's focusing on the cells and so that's why that was the first test it is fda approved no one really uses it because it's not doesn't provide you actionable information if your doctor runs that test whatever the result is doesn't impact how the patient is met treated and so therefore that has grown out of favor and there is a difference between fda approval and actually clinical usefulness that that is important to recognize now when you look at a test like grail for example the fda has not approved it yet but it is still permitted in use explain that distinction this is a complicated area in in the diagnostic space in the u.s where there's really two kinds of ways tests can be regulated by the government such that they can be used on patients one is the one that's well known as fda approval which is of course an agency that focuses on develop on approving drugs and and diagnostic tests um and evaluates them carefully and then allows companies to give some approval to market them if if they pass all their the bar of what you need to show the second way is actually a much easier way to get assays out to patients and that is uh by setting up the assay in a lab that is compliant with what's called the clia act which is a basically an act of congress that focuses on regulating laboratories that do diagnostic tests that's independent of the fda and those way that roughly works is that the lab itself gets this designation that yes you guys are doing things in an appropriate way they get inspected every year or two and uh to make sure they're doing things appropriately and then those labs have the blessing to develop any tests that they want uh using the procedures that they're supposed to follow with you know running control those kind of things and then offer them to patients so the fda never reviews the reviews those it's really a much less highly regulated because basically the individual tests aren't regulated it's the laboratory that's regulated um and that is what you know garden did before they got their fda clearance that's what grail is doing that's what all the diagnostic companies uh they start by building a clia laboratory and then building their assays in that frame because they're much less regulated so you can start selling them to patients and providers long before you'd ever get fda approval so from a technology standpoint i mean there are like 30 other companies that are out there doing this right now and not to use the word grail again but the holy grail is the blood test that's going to take a patient who doesn't think they have cancer screen them with a high enough sensitivity and specificity that i do the blood test and it says peter we're afraid that you have you know colon cancer what i i had a colonoscopy two years ago well it looks like you have it again go get a colonoscopy next week lo and behold there's a tiny little adenomatous polyp there that is an early stage one and gosh i need just the smallest little partial colectomy and i'm i'm cured because that is a 100 curable cancer or you know a woman gets a blood test and it says you have breast cancer and she says that can't be i don't feel a lump my mammography was negative six months ago understood maybe you should go get a diffusion weighted image mri and look at that breast a little more closely and sure enough there it is what would really be amazing is if we had the confidence in these things that even if they were never showing up on imaging you could treat them right i mean that would be this is now we're getting back into science fiction what's science fiction science fiction is in if in five years you're going to have a one centimeter pancreatic adenocarcinoma and you know you and i max both know that even a one centimeter pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a 25 5 year survival i mean that that is a death sentence of a cancer unfortunately even at stage one so you know waiting until you can see a billion cells on the ct or mri is not going to be the way to remedy pancreatic cancer it's either going to be much earlier detection or treatments that actually work so today we have neither of the above is there a path to this sci-fi world that i'm dreaming of we're using the blood alone we can actually start to develop a high enough sense of confidence that that patient does indeed have cancer but they might be three or four years away from it being clinically detectable i do think i am hopeful that we could get there um it's not going to come in one step but we are already taking steps towards that so building building the you know the bricks on top of each other and the reason i say that is that the easier application again is in the patients who already known to have cancer where we have these super sensitive tests that we can then run after and see who's cured or not so that we now have we we have these tests that that can detect the state that's called minimal residual disease meaning microscopic cells that are residual after your treatment and that have currently at least a very high positive predictive value meaning that if you detect the ctdna the patient is very likely going to have the cancer grow back and is that guiding therapy is that immediately now sending you to adjuvant therapy right away that's that's exactly where it's going excellent point so there's now studies clinical trials underway to do that so we've recently launched a couple here at stanford and lung cancer where we're taking patients with early stage lung cancer they can have one of the trials that it's very broad they can have radiation or surgery whatever it is appropriate if they need chemo for their standard of care for their stage they get that too when they're done with every standard thing they get the blood test and we do the this minerals agilities test if it's positive we give those patients immunotherapy before we can we can't see any cancer anywhere in the body but we know they have microscopic cells left behind and that is the moment in the patient's uh you know lifetime with their cancer that they will have the least number of cells they'll ever have yeah and the and the fewest mutations yeah exactly the lowest heterogeneity right the lowest chance of having resistance so i'm very hopeful that by doing that we will be able to cure more patients and we already have evidence of that because we know adjuvant treatment even given the brute force way like we've done for decades where we basically give it to everybody the same drug in adjuvant is more effective than the same drug in metastatic uh you know absolutely yeah i think this is a very important point that gets lost on the part of many people in the field which is early detection absolutely matters and you have to look no further than that simple point which hasn't i've never seen it refuted less tumor burden it's less heterogeneity equals better outcomes it's an axiom that's correct it's absolutely true and that's because we know that you know we now understand much better that why cancers are become initially respond and become resistance is because of this heterogeneous genetic heterogeneity that they already have mutations they're not all the same the cancer cells actually all two no two cells are probably the same they're all different they all have slightly different handful mutations that are different between each cell and some the more cancer you have the higher chance that one of those mutations will make the cancer resistant to whatever therapy you're using so this idea of guiding adjuvant therapy based on ctna mrd i think is the first step towards what you know the the future that you're that you're envisioning or dreaming of and and so let's think about which cancers that's going to be relevant in so it will not be relevant in pancreatic because everybody's gonna probably need adjuvant i mean if you're really being honest it certainly is relevant in your field of lung cancer it's certainly going to be relevant in breast cancer it's certainly going to be relevant in colorectal cancer i mean you could you could potentially argue prostate although the the treatment is pretty bad um those that really takes care of kind of the big five right there the common ones yeah yeah i throw in bladder which is whatever the 67 most common cancer you could of course some of the more rare ones it will be useful melanoma of course it's much more rare of course but um where we also give adrien i i agree with you i think i mean the way that i think of it actually is um it's going to be useful in the cases where a minority of patients develops recurrence if you have a situation like pancreas cancer where the vast majority of stage 1 patients will develop recurrence that's not the place to start this kind of developing this kind of a test because like you said that the tests aren't ever going to be 100 perfect and you even a perfect you know you already have no test gives you 75 chance of recurrence um that um it uh it that's not the place to do it it's to do it in places where there's a subset that recur and in many cancers actually that may be at certain stages you don't need it stage three colon cancer well maybe we don't need it there yeah we know the probability of recurrence is high enough we should just treat us accordingly yeah maybe maybe we should just treat it but stage one two that's a different story right the minority recur there so i think that's how i think of it of a where to first uh focus on so so so we've talked a lot about where we are on that call that stage one right or you know program one uh identifying the high risk patient who needs adjuvant therapy great progress on lung what is the state of the art for that exact problem on breast prostate and colorectal cancer so there are active uh studies underway um the um colorectal cancer actually i would argue might be the furthest along there actually are some medicare approved tests using ctdna from a company called natera for colorectal cancer um that um that i believe can be reimbursed in some patients actually even though there hasn't been uh proof of benefit of that that you know that the at treating based on it matters but um that's something that got approved recently so i think in those patients like the substance it can already be done in a doctor's office but there are many trials going on in collective cancer actually many more than in lung cancer currently and there are trials going on in breast cancer to also do similar things now breast and prostate are actually more challenging for a couple of reasons but one is they have very low levels of circulating tumor dna it seems that there's difference between tumor types and how much circulation they shed for a certain amount of volume and they seem to have lower levels so it's a little more challenging so you need to use these very very sensitive mutation based methods and probably even the subset of mutation based methods that's most um sensitive um but there there are so i know there's studies going on in um in breast cancer i'm actually not aware of prostate cancer studies in the ctdna space because of this issue of the very low concentrations but i wouldn't be shocked if there are now some places that are doing a few yeah prostate seems to be a very privileged site i mean even the grail test i think they say really it doesn't screen effectively for prostate because you're just not getting enough cell free dna in the circulation that's correct or or breast actually the the you know the grails and development plant initially was largely around breast but they then pivoted because the early results were that breast also they didn't do very well so that's then i think would it be that the next stage of patients you're interested in treating are patients who are say post-adjuvant therapy or who were deemed low enough risk to not need adjuvant therapy but who are still higher risk in the general population in whom you're screening for recurrence would that be kind of the next group you would want to develop a liquid biopsy to assess yeah i think so i think you know if we can get proof of principle of that these things that this approach works in these early studies i think that some logical next knowledge concepts would be exactly what you say which is uh the way i view that is you could envision a future where uh actually maybe even you move into the more high risk patients with higher risk of recurrence where there's still a substantial number that don't recur but you do this test repeatedly let's say every three months and you don't give adjuvant until you see a signal that the test is positive so maybe even that way you minimize missing patients uh and you can still catch them months before they have clinical recurrence and i think it's very likely that kind of an approach where you basically only give adjuvant the test is positive but you do the test longitudinally to make sure that you don't misp minimize missing people that that would very likely have equivalent outcomes to giving everybody in that group treatment actually maybe even better because you're you're not giving toxicity to a big chunk of patients so that's one the second one which i think is really exciting um is uh analogous to that basically which is to you know i guess it's it's the same set of trials but i think it's looking at it the other way around which is to say that patience uh you would avoid over treating patients so one big problem we have right now in adjuvant therapy in places like many places but you know breast cancer is a good example of it we treat the number need to treat is quite high because most patients don't already care about the surgeon and don't have micromanage diet disease and then the treatments aren't perfect so the ones even though that have micrometeoroid diseases infinite number don't benefit so uh actually we have a huge problem with overtreatment and this approach that i outlined with a repeat testing could could get us away from that over treatment situation where we only give the treatment to the patients where we have uh real evidence you know substantial evidence that they still have cancer cells in the body so those are three great use cases for liquid biopsies that are all going to benefit from a very important insight which is you know the mutations of the cancer at the outset so you get to pair a very important piece of information which is tumor identification genetically with cell free dna we now need a different approach if we're going to move to the the sort of panacea of cancer screening which is every person once a year goes to their doctor gives 10 or 20 ml of blood and a test comes back that says one do you have any cancer yes or no two if you do it's this organ let's go work it up which either means in the early stages more diagnostics in the later stages means direct to treatment right that would be again what we talked about earlier it seems to me that one way to think about that is if you were going to try to do that based on mutation analysis you would have to develop the world's most robust database of mutations for every given tumor is that is that even possible yeah great question um so we about a year and a half ago published a paper where we developed actually a mutation based lung cancer screening method using ct dna we call that method lung clip for calipis cancer likelihood in plasma and it's a method that is purely based on mutations the way it works actually is you sequence the plasma and the white blood cells of the of this screening patient the same thing on the patients you're trying to screen you sequence both the ct cf dna cell free dna and the leukocyte dna the reason we do that is because we've learned that there in particularly older individuals there are mutations present in the leukocytes often that have been acquired through age through a process called clonal hematopoiesis so those mutations that are in the white blood cells also end up showing up in the plasma most of the time because the white blood cells die in the circulation and release their dna and that's part of the cell free dna so those you want to get rid of because we don't that's not coming from a lung cancer or breast cancer right so we do both we subtract the things that are in the white blood cells and then we use a machine learning algorithm that looks at the mutations that are left in the plasma and looks at things like how long is the cell free dna molecule we haven't talked about it but there's we have and others have shown that the cancer derived sulfur dna molecules are a little bit shorter than that 170 bases they're a tiny bit a few bases shorter on average the reason we think is because it probably most of the dna in the blood comes from white blood cells we know that's true about 80 90 percent of the cell free dna is coming from white blood cells and that the other 10 or 20 percent comes from solid organs as well as cancer and probably the dna has to traverse longer to get into the blood right if you could die in the tissue and then you to get into the blood takes a while and that's probably a long longer time to to be exposed to the enzymes that are yeah that's right so we think that's part of the problem it may also be that some of the way the histones in the chromatin is configured may contribute to it but for whatever reason that is true so we look at is a mutation present what gene is the mutation in how long is a cell free dna fragment is this mutation one of the mutations that is caused by smoking all these different things and they put that in the machine learning model and the machine learning model isn't just saying have i seen this mutation before in lung cancer but it's looking at these other properties to say do the properties of the mutations match what you'd expect in a lung cancer and then the model ultimately spits out a probability that that blood sample was from a patient with lung cancer or not and so that is i think the way that i would you know envision doing it using mutation based approach where you're not actually doing this catalog of mutations because that won't work unfortunately because every cancer is unique and you can have mutation in any in any gene in any position right so but you're using i assume you can use machine learning to basically predict what should be a cancer mutation versus not that's what we're doing exactly right yes you basically you try to use as much information as you can get beyond just the mutation being there and now in subs in follow-up work we are trying to extend that by adding more such features right the more features you have that you know are cancer that link with cancer the better it is the other question is can we combine that with methylation maybe the combination of the two right uh you could kind of leverage the best of both worlds can we combine with other analytes other other approaches so those that's how i think we're going to move forward uh to try to develop the ultimately the best screening test and it very likely will be a combination of combining you know it's not just methylation or just mutation or just you know what's called fragmentomics which is this size of the size of the molecules or the on their distribution um it likely will be a combo method and so that's still very much in the early research phase one has to prove which of those things combine nicely and and usefully and then once you know that then you have to think about okay can i develop an assay that's you know affordable that one could imagine doing on hundreds of millions of people um you know but we're still at the at the discovery phase do you have a sense of what the theoretical limits look like assuming you can take information from each of those data sets right so fragment size or features of the fragment length uh methylation patterns predictive mutations etc and based on what you know about the frequency with which you can identify cell-free dna and given that we're now exclusively talking about patients that do not have disease on any other imaging modality let's just limit it to pre-stage one or say at best stage one early stage one realistically where do you think the sensitivity and specificity could be pushed to yeah for stage one can i think that's a great question and i i think we don't really know yet i think one critical question is one critical pr experiment which is what we're currently doing is to take the most sensitive method we have which is this this third gen method i mentioned that has the one in a million sensitivity apply that to a large cord of stage one patients and see how many of those patients can we now detect uh circulating tumor dna in uh when we know the mutations okay this is not the screening question but it's sort of the preamble to it where we we have a we can definitively say these patients have ct dna and how much in stage one so that experiment will tell us what is actually the lay of the land for the the amount of circuit intermediate shedding in stage one lung cancer once we have that we will know what sensitivity do we have to get to with a naive approach meaning we don't know what the patient has cancer you know with this integrated approach um and before i before i can say basically i need and to see that data but i you know i'm hopeful we can you know uh push it above the the five percent we talked about earlier so in our study from uh a year or two ago we uh within stage one we could get to about twenty percent uh sensitivity for uh including in stage one a uh non-small cell lung cancer in a validation cohort um so and what was the uh specificity the specificity was ninety nine ninety eight nine ninety 98 i think it was tuned into that in that analysis 98 which again probably again i know that's early stage it's still just not going to make sense for people whose incoming pre-test probability is one to two percent it's just max is that if someone has a pre-test probability of one percent i mean it sounds crazy you're going to need 80 sensitivity and 99.5 specificity to say this is a test that matters this is a test where okay now my positive predictive value is high enough that i can do something with this and just as importantly my negative predictive value means i can breathe easy right uh i i think in the ideal world you're absolutely right i mean again this is are we do you think this is a decade away is that is it yeah i guess it's it's hard to i mean it's possible we can't get there with this approach right so if you had asked this question in the 50s with some of the protein biomarker work which was exciting right people would have said well sure okay we're not there but maybe in 10 years we will yeah so it i think we um we don't know what we don't know we don't know but we don't know right we don't know we don't even know this what the real distribution of ctdna is uh because most of the experiments have used an insensitive method where most of them are negative well then that doesn't we can't see what's negative right so um i think i'm hopeful we can get can get increase it significantly i'm hopeful we can get to at least 50 percent you know 50 to 75 percent can we get to 89. 50 to 75 if it's truly early stage one that's a big step forward if you can keep your specificity north of 99 correct so there are some some liquid biopsy groups that have kind of done that by uh decreasing saying okay let's go with 80 specificity because if you ever test 99 specificity uh that has 20 sensitivity now you drop the specificity to 80 your sensitivity management goes up by 20 right because it's just it's just the dumb luck yeah and your negative predictive value goes out the window so so that's the problem right so uh i think for the foreseeable future it's there's going to be sort of this two two sort of main areas the way i think about applying these one is in the cancers that have no screening tests currently the bar is of course much lower right we we know that mammography even low-dose ct uh some you know uh mayor colonoscopy's a little bit of an exception but none of those are perfect obviously and yet we do them and at least for the case of lung cancer and the colon screening we're very confident they save lives we think for breast cancer i love crusades you know there's controversy around that but the um the in in the cases where we don't have screening tests if we can even get a test that's kind of like that not perfect but can get us some that could be helpful like it would be ideal in the case like pancreatic cancer but for reasons we talked about earlier but then we don't have the tree yeah we don't know what to do yeah we know what to do with them and i don't think that's the right place to do it but other cancers you know that we don't screen for um so there's that group and there may be the bar is lower because we don't have a predicate right in the cancers that that we already have screening tests for i think it's really important how we compare how the tests compare to the existing screening tests obviously if they're as good or better than what we're already doing well then you could argue well then we should switch to those right even if they're not perfect but um but if they're worse which is currently the situation the liquid biopsies aren't as good as those tests then you really have to think hard about how you would use them and then i think the main use has to start to be something that's more around practical considerations or health systems considerations like low-dose ct for example we know a minor tiny minority of patients who are eligible are currently getting it in the u.s medicare pays for it but the vast majority of patients who are eligible don't get it so why is that well there's many reasons but part of it could be you know this concern of radiation exposure the difficulty of having to book another appointment to go to an imaging facility access to the imaging facility so if you're already at your primary care doctor you're getting your pimga a1c tested or whatever it's probably easier to draw another couple tubes of blood and send those off right so there could be but that's not the dream that's that's helpful but it doesn't solve the problem for us i guess so so i think that's sort of you know how would russian develop it but we still need to prove again i think very important that these tests decrease cancer-specific death because i think ultimately we should even though they're exciting technologies and uh we're very hopeful that they will we shouldn't just give them a pass because they're high-tech and not do the right clinical science do you know of any companies out there that are actually in pursuit of what we're talking about as the dream scenario where you have a an actual high sensitivity high specificity test for low stage early stage one i mean i i think all the companies are working to try to improve their their tests um constantly you know and this is one of the things with this because they're being run in the clia environment it's actually much easier to change the test than it is under the fda and uh approval um so i i think people are trying hard uh i haven't seen it solved if you know i guess it's the next obvious question uh and you know and that includes my group we're working on it hard we have some ideas we think are promising um but it's too early to know how much they're gonna push the bar over you know what we showed in the prior paper or what grail showed in in their recent papers how much money is the nih putting into this uh on a global scale that's a great question actually i've never seen a number of how much uh funding are they doing for a liquid biopsy research i can tell you that it's increased dramatically so just in general when i started working in this area like probably 2012-ish you know with the first publication 2014 when i was going to meetings around those times i would often be the only person talking about circling tumor dna uh there would be a bunch of other diagnostics imaging and a lot of circling tumor cell work at that time that was being presented whereas now you know the vast majority of of per presentation that meeting stuff is focused on liquid biopsy the same thing i've seen at the nih in in study section you know reviewing grants so you know many of us including myself serve the you know serve on this nih study section where one scores the grants that the nih the the scores that the nh uses to fund research and it's a lot of work because you got to read dozens of grants and you know you spend days of your of your week uh reading other people's grants and commenting on them but it's a service we do because of course otherwise the system doesn't work um but now in in this section i sit on which is focused on cancer biomarkers we see lots and lots of um of liquid biopsy work being submitted and often scoring high so i think it's substantial it's increased dramatically from 2012. um and there's a lot of interest from at nci and nih and these they you know they see the value just like uh many of us do and that this is an area we absolutely have to to push forward uh and deserves more funding max this was super interesting i mean this is a topic i've been interested in for years and i learned a lot today i really have a much better sense of the landscape um and the history of how it got where it got so i'm positive that everybody listening to this will even if they came in with less information than me or more information is going to have gleaned something so thanks so much for for making the time and setting aside you know a few hours of your your day to talk about this and to catch up in general it's just great well great yeah it was really a pleasure uh chatting with you it's great to see you again and uh yep thanks for all the insightful questions i really enjoyed the conversation i hope your your listeners got something out of it i'm positive they will thanks max
