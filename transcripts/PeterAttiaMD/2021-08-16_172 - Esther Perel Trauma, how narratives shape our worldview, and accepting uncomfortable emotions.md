Esther Perel is a psychotherapist and New York Times bestselling author who is an expert on modern relationships. In this episode, Esther describes how being a child of parents who narrowly survived the Holocaust shaped and influenced her perspectives and ultimately led to her to a career in therapy. She discusses how the generational differences in parenting, among other things, led to the rise of individualism with a focus on happiness and self-esteem to the detriment of our relationships and sense of community. Ultimately, the conversation focuses on the value of our relationships with others for one’s sense of wellbeing, ability to deal with past trauma, resilience, and even our lifespan. She uses real world case studies to emphasize the therapeutic value of creating healthy relationships with others and oneself, explaining how our relationships with others can be a mirror into our own maladaptive behaviors. Esther explains how our self-narratives, which are often shaped by past trauma, may negatively impact our relationships with others and our emotional health, and emphasizes the value in trying to change them when warranted.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA hey yes there thank you uh thank you so much for uh for sitting down with me today it's it's been a while I've wanted to sit down and have uh the discussion we're about to have it's a pleasure now I I I I detect a slight accent is that New

[00:00:26] Jersey oh yes um right across the river right right right uh how how many languages do you speak I speak nine languages yeah I as as someone who speaks 1.25 languages it just it blows my mind and I'm sure we're GNA get to how one learns nine languages but um you grew up in Belgium I grew up in Belgium yeah um tell me a little bit about that linguistically or broader yeah broader I think um you know you've you've spoken in the past about the impact that your parents uh survival had on your upbringing um maybe you could tell folks a little bit about that because I I I'm going to assume not everybody is familiar with your story so I grew up in Belgium I was born in luren which is a one of the oldest university towns in Europe and then I grew up in antp um to two polish parents who were both the sole survivors of their entire family of the Nazi concentration camps and they by fluke arrived to Belgium there was no they had a permit there for about three months and then they decided to stay and so they ended up being another five years illegal refugees in Belgium and um I was educated in antp which was a Flemish

[00:02:03] City so I did 12 years of schooling in Flemish but we spoke also French and Yiddish and German and polish in the house and that just was the way it was it's the air that you breed nobody made a big deal out of speaking all these languages and learning them um so that's the the basics um when you finished your uh education your high school education what was the next step for you where did you go after that the first thing I did after I finished high school was come to the

[00:02:39] United States to travel for almost two months and I ended up hitchhiking across the US and seeing the country in a way that I probably will never see it again and then I went to study in Jerusalem so I went to the Hebrew University that's where I did my undergraduate and then I started my graduate school school there and I came to Boston to Leslie College to finish the second year of my master's program and to start my training in Family

[00:03:10] Therapy at the Cambridge Family Institute and to work at Mass mental health which was one of the Harvard Medical School hospitals and um and then basically I never used my return ticket and here I am well let's go back to the the the the hitchhiking trip what what made you decide to venture from Europe to the United

[00:03:31] States in the first place and when you did so did you have this plan of actually hitchhiking or was that something that developed once you arrived I had hitched hike before in Europe and in Israel um I had since I was traveling at age 14 a major way that you traveled when you were curious and broke was to hitchhike so it was perfectly uh in fashion at that time to do so and why the United States because it was the bicentennial and uh there were cheap cargo flights that took you from Belgium to the US uh Capital

[00:04:08] Airlines was like this first invention of old planes refurbished for for uh people who didn't need much comfort and uh no I had a greyhound pass we I was with my boyfriend we had a greyhound pass and we thought we would be traveling with gryan but every time my finger went up it went so well and I I got in invited into the homes of every kind of person that lives in this country and the kindness of strangers really uh like in ways that I probably would never have access to today so it was the whole West Coast it was

[00:04:43] Louisiana Mississippi Alabama and then the Northeast so um that that's that it it turned out this way because of a whole Adventure basically I had lost my we lost our wallet and our traveler checks if you remember that concept and uh and everything and we didn't have phones at the time of course so somebody found it and this man came to pick us up and and at a downtown station in La and he invited us to his house and from that moment on this trip took on a whole different uh personality for us and um that was that seven weeks later I had just you know really had an insiders look that that innocence and curiosity allowed me to uh and and a good sense of Street smartness which you need when you'd hitchhike of course um did that in part sort of give you a little bit of an affection for American culture um and is that maybe part of the reason why you ultimately ended up uh setting up Roots here actually no um I I was fascinated you know I came before I came to study in Boston I came for another trip I did another hitchhiking trip in Mexico for quite a few weeks and then I went all the way from Merida to Miami to Quebec so and then I did a third trip where I spent the entire summer in New York City in the late 70s so you can imagine um it was a different city no I liked it I was very curious but I had no intention ever of coming to live in what we call at a

[00:06:29] Time in America um I and I came to study because um I had the opportunity to come to Cambridge and nobody in my family had gone to University like this and I was the first and you know I had read bores and I thought Cambridge was a fascinating place to come and study and I should take this opportunity and I had no idea that I would stay so I stayed in

[00:06:55] Cambridge for a couple of years and then I came to New York thinking I have to do the new yor York adventure for one year um and I came with my husband now who was boyfriend then and I really didn't think I would stay but um I fell in love with New York that I knew uh and it's always been very clear to me that it would be Manhattan or abroad that my real affection was for New York City you could be anything and every part of you in one place and I had always looked for a place to integrate the multiple parts of me and this seemed to be the place where I could do so now I want to kind of go back to something you said at the at the outset which is both your mother and your father were the sole survivors from their families meaning their parents their siblings their Aunts Uncles everybody perished is that did I understand that correctly that's correct yes my father came from a family of uh nine and he was the youngest my mother came from a family of seven every single one of their siblings were married with seven to 10 children and so each of them lost 200 people about um and um they basically met on the day of

[00:08:14] Liberation uh on the roads where people were looking for other people from the same area that could tell them if anybody else had survived you know it was um and that's kind of how they met up and um um yeah that was it they were the only ones do do you have a sense of what permitted them to be the survivors do you do you do you attribute it to sheer luck or uh I mean the odds seem almost unimaginable given the circumstances of their periphery so the war for them starts in 39 because they live on the German side of Poland so this is a very long War it's six years about uh my mother spent the first year in the woods she's 18 she hides in the woods which is really where she suffered the most and she actually went by herself to a labor camp a men's labor camp because she had in her mind that if she can work in the kitchen or laundry that somehow at least she will wake up every morning in the same place whereas in the woods she had no idea and she she couldn't take the dread anymore uh um she proceeds to go to nine different camps over the five years and my father went to 14 of them including a stint in in Siberia when I would ask them uh there were generally a series of three points the first one was luck simply sheer luck I wasn't selected every morning when they chose a thousand people somehow it didn't pick me the second one was we wanted to live we wanted to live we thought maybe somebody is waiting for us somewhere and we were going to live with dignity so my mother describes mending her socks folding her clothes doing basic things that kind of maintain their sense of humanity and for my father uh my father basically in the last year and a half created a kind of a black market in the kitchen where he had more access to potatoes this wasn't very potato Poes and potato peels and he managed to feed about 60 young people that all survived thanks to that because it meant that they could go work and as long as you could work you had a chance of at least surviving including he he fed the

[00:10:43] Germans the na the SS guards and uh and I think feeling that he could help others gave him a sense that um of of uh of agency of Mastery of purpose of I'm I I I can do something here so luck was a piece of it it wasn't the only thing but it always was mentioned so when you were growing up I assume that you had friends who were not from that uh background and therefore they would have uh quote unquote normal things like grandparents and cousins and aunts and uncles things that you did not have was that contrast Stark for you as a young child so I grew up in a kind of a a dual situation um I grew we had a clothing store in a working class neighborhood I lived above the store I worked in this store we were like the Immigrant family on the Block the my parents had accents they didn't speak very well slemish uh it like in any neighborhood where you have that that store that is owned but instead of a food store it was a clothing store you know that's when I am born but come 12 years after my brother so this is by then there is a store that then didn't start like this right and um my father on occasion would kind of say you know he would put their hand on the shoulder of of a client of a customer and just say we went through some very bad things during the war like and I would think like how would they relate to any of this then there was the Jewish community that we were part of where most of the people had numbers on their arms so the first question you ask at 2 years old is why don't I have a grandma or a grandpa and then the second time is what is this number and then the third time is why don't I have uncles and aunts and so you you ask this very and you don't it's not just because you see other children it's because you read children's books and in the children book is a story of a family and it has a few generations and we had none of that and we had about five pictures that showed that they were you know they had managed to save a few pictures so that said there were these other people um and so the Jewish community that I grew up in was all Holocaust Survivors that's this was normative for me this was a very normal you know it's like a refugee

[00:13:18] Community then you only know refugees but then in the store where these other people you've spoken a little bit about it but I I I I find it to be kind of amazing how your parents survival changed their outlook on life and how that impacted your out out outlook on life um say a little bit about that there sort of uh their zest for life if you will you know one of the things my dad always used to say is we came from harsh circumstances we were used to the bitter cold I used to carry bags of cement on my back I was I we were much better prepared than those who came from Greece or the Mediterranean or you know Urban environments there was something about being from kind of peasant stock basically that prepared them for hardship um and I don't know you know the the interesting thing is why does this story stay with me out of a thousand others that he has told me they they talked a lot so it's like what what you know today this is not really what you ask but it's often you know when I get asked a question like this and I start to answer it I realized a thousand questions that I didn't get to ask that

[00:14:42] I just took the story as it was told like a Swiss cheese with all the holes in it and never kind of said but how did you go from here to there it's just like we went and you know uh like she mended her socks how did you do that where did you find a needle where did you find you know all these very granular details that I have no real answer to but I think uh what what I got there was a few different things the first thing I got which actually really came back very strongly during the pandemic this year you know was the notion that everything can disappear in a split second don't ever think that what you have is there to stay and is yours and on the one hand It prepares you for dis for for catastrophes for disasters for Change and on the other end you can never fully fully settle and you never you're never fully calm because you don't know that the ground you sit on could not at any moment you know open up that's I think probably the most important thing is that sense of impermanence the sense of loss the mass of loss the collective loss of not just people but Life Community legacies generations of stuff um that's another thing I think I have a real um sense of what that is you know and and when I I I plumb into mind when I need to reach in other people's experience of loss like that um but also and dread mean that goes with that and then on the other side yes this enormous zest for life I mean they were not just there to work and rebuild my parents were real Bon viant I mean they loved life they really enjoyed to party to sing to dance to um and that in my work and in my personal life but in my work when I around trauma and around pain and suffering I you know I can I I have a reference for how one comes back from there how one loves again celebrates again parties again um in a way that is not just them but they happen to be the ones that I knew the best and um and these things have very much influenced me in in my thinking and in my Outlook on the world I mean yeah there's lots of other things but so if on the one hand it's entirely remarkable that your parents survive the ordeal that they were placed in it seems equally remarkable that they weren't permanently scarred by it and if we've talked about some of the factors that may have contributed to their ability to survive what they did for six years what do you contribute to their ability to come out the backside and experience everything you just said which is um because I have to imagine that there were many people who survived concentration games but they were never the same again uh they were never able to form meaningful relationships the

[00:18:01] PTSD of the experience effectively left them dead even though they were still breathing so why I mean I'm guessing your parents didn't have access to MDMA assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD and world-class psychotherapists I'm guessing they did this somehow on their own no but they had access to something else see my mother in the 50s went to the big professor at the University in luren and basically he kind of said to her what you experienced one can't just come back from and there is nothing there is no medication or treatment for this kind of stuff and she had nightmares and she had massive eruptions sometimes um and she you know she'd go and check the door a few times in the night at that time and stuff so we didn't call it PTSD we just called it survivor syndrome actually was the name at the time but she had access to what today are called a spa my mother did talaso therapy mud therapy uh walking on wet grass all the things that today are part of the wellness treatments that were that are all traditional things that were done in the bath of Eastern Europe in

[00:19:22] Czechoslovakia in Hungary in Poland and she went every year for a month to the spa where she was doing bath and water and mud and big jets of Frozen water uh the stuff that you do when you go from hot to cold this was like traditional medicine so that's the stuff she did to calm her nerves which was called at the time calling you you know you had nerve nerve issues nervousness the other thing because I have said I mean it is a thing

[00:19:59] I wrote in mating in captivity that kind of followed me around afterwards where I said that I was interested in that very question what made some people want to live what feeds aliveness what is this antidote to death or deadness and I remember describing my observation between those who did not die and those who came back to life you know those who could never trust and those who reconnected again Etc but I think what really and this is very relevant for today what my parents had was a strong sense of community so you know all these people come out of the camps and first they go to DP camps to

[00:20:41] Temporary camps and the amount of babies that were conceived there because all these people wanted to have children to know as a way of proving that they are alive that they are human that they can still procreate and that in itself is such an act of healing you know you you rebuild you didn't destroy it all you didn't you didn't sever all connection you know they will be a future there will be more of us that's the first thing then this community comes together and they have

[00:21:13] Gatherings for the survivors of town such and such for the survivors of Camp such and such they plant trees they celebrate they tell stories they fundamentally understood something that today we're trying to bring in that is that such a what is called today Collective trauma that was called psychosocial trauma demands Collective resilience they didn't try to do anything on their own you know now the first years they don't talk much they arve to these foreign countries and most of the time people don't really want to hear much of what they've gone through you know it's like you tell two sentences and people can't hear anymore meaning even amongst each other not no no no with each other they tell but they don't always have to tell you see it could be this kind of short you know that camp was a bad camp that SS God you did not want to be under him you know I managed in that winter they had all these sentences like that that just Shand and everybody knew what was the reference everybody knew what where you know what it came back to so to each other they talked a lot and you know I've always had this image that that I I once told because it's such a powerful thing every Sunday my parents played cards friends came over and they played cards so they're playing Jin Rami and stuff and as they were playing with these cards somebody would just suddenly say whatever happened to John you know

[00:22:42] Morris John Mitchell John whatever oh this one was gassed this one was murdered he didn't make it he went to Australia and I couldn't believe what I was hearing it was like there was no child development approach in my house you know nobody looked to see if there's a child there to hear all of this it was done in this affectless way there was no affect Horrors were told in that dis what today we would call dissociation but for the purpose of survival and regeneration it was a very good natural defense and I think that what is interesting about that group which is really the first time that people understood the concept of adult trauma because until then it was all about first five years of your life is that they came up with some of the most adaptive resilient ways of going about things without ever seeing a shrink without any access to mental health just something inside their own tradition that they had you know that history this was not the first time Jews were having a rough time time in history right they the these resources really were gleaned from a a culture that is collective in nature and it's not the only one for sure so that's I think really what helped them more than anything else walks in the woods was a ritual you needed to go into nature this is like you know everybody's writing about that this pandemic year something that about them knew that being in the forest is healing now recently you wrote something um on

[00:24:33] Mother's Day actually about your um relationship with your mother and you wrote about um all the positive things and many of the positive things that your mother did for you but at the same time there were things she didn't do for you and it's left you with a feeling of ambivalence uh at least with respect to to to some of the motherdaughter things that um maybe weren't there

[00:24:59] H how how did that unfold for you as you went from being a child to an adolescent and and I assume at the time you didn't think this was abnormal because you had nothing to compare it to I assume this was a a retrospective reflection I would say from the time I was an adolescent to the time I was an adult is really more the the the sequence you know so it's very interesting I have I have not talked often about this but I just was s tired of hearing about Mother's Day and

[00:25:31] Hallmark cart Mother's Day and I thought I there's so many people who have complicated relationships with their mother maybe we should put that on the table for a change so I whipped this thing out on on Sunday because it's very easy for me with a good dose of humor to to to describe my mother and what's phenomenal is thousands of people are writing to me basically say this is my mother this is my mother so I know she's not unique you know and she comes in every culture and she comes in every color um you know but basically uh she had this thing with the evil eye right she was a very superstitious woman so this whole idea that you shouldn't say good things to your kid because it will blow their head that's she took that to the very concrete level you know and so you know she had this notion that she is there to tell what other people will not tell you and that's usually not the good stuff and so she was true to to herself till the end she didn't say one good word to me ever ever how old were you when she died I was uh she was 80 uh and I was 42 so by the time she died you had already achieved a lot of professional success no I was no not completely yes in my field but I hadn't written mating in captivity I actually started to write mating after she passed away and I remember saying this is the first time

[00:27:07] I'm actually doing something that I'm not sure I can do and I don't think I could ever have done this when she was alive for fear that she would be critical of you saying why are you doing this you don't have the uh you don't have the experience to do this or something like that yeah I mean because every time I made a decision I had to have confidence one time for me and one time for her anxiety I had to prove to her whatever it was this was true for the hitchhiking trip too this was true for going to study in Jerusalem this was true for coming to live in New York this was everything everything I decided you know she would challenge me challenge me challenge me and so I had to I had to have inside of me a sense that I knew that I can do it I have to succeed at this you know not to prove her wrong but just to be able to do what I want I wasn't you know it wasn't to defy her but um this time I began to write and I thought to myself I have no idea I I had

[00:28:09] I remember saying I've always done things that somewhere inside of me I think I'm capable of doing you know these are sentences that I remember saying back then and this is the first time that I'm taking something out I have no idea but her voice isn't there to make me feel like I have to be sure I'm allowed to do something without knowing and I'll do the best I can and

[00:28:37] I'll pour my soul into this but that's all I have rather than I know I can which was The Stance I had to have before then so I think the ambivalence that you're asking about is really you know it's not uncommon that you have a family and the mom becomes the strict one she's the stern one she's the more critical one and my dad is sugar candy he's the sweetest you know the sweetest kindest loving adoring dad and what you begin to understand once you start to study family therapy is that of course he's always kind and loving and adoring because he leaves some of the dirty job to her she has to put the limits she has to you know uh um basically put the limits do the Discipline Do all the stuff that he doesn't like to do and I began to understand that the good parent and the bad parent or the the the soft parent and the harder parent that's a construct that is not just a matter of

[00:29:41] Personality because my mother was also very she had tremendous Charisma and she was funny and Brilliant and all of that too that in fact it's because of how he acts that that puts her in this role and this role then is already the quota is filled so so he doesn't really have to do it and once I saw that I began to see my dad is not the all good that he actually leaves her alone comes home 3 hours later doesn't call to tell her leaves her standing with all the cooked food in the kitchen and of course when he comes home she's all pissed and yelling that he doesn't respect her or that she's there you know standing there like an idiot in her you know and me instead of thinking stop screaming I began to say why did you just do this to her you know in your beautiful loving way but you just stood her up and once you begin to reorganize the movie and the interpretation of the movie then you suddenly realize she's actually not only the negative you know my anger goes to her and my love goes to him kind of thing and that's when you begin to experience the ability to hold contradictory emotions at the same time and that's ambivalence ambivalence is the ability to hold both end I love you and I also have a lot of anger toward you and those two are coexisting inside of me rather than I split off one part and then I attribute it somewhere else um and once I began to do that then I was able to diffuse her things you know if she was critical of something you know I had a way of joking with her um that that basically didn't allow her to enter under my skin and I just could really say you know all kinds of diffusing tricks that

[00:31:41] I had learned basically my favorite one which because I I've used it with so many people in my own therapy work afterwards was to just give her a kiss on the cheek and just say I so appreciate how you're trying to make me a better person but I want you to know I think I you've done a good job I I think

[00:32:00] I've got I'm where you I I'm where you I think you would want me to be so if you want you can go try to improve others it worked very well for me I would laugh as I said it instead of feeling the Wrath mounting inside of [Laughter] me so what Drew you to therapy as a career I would ask myself what drew me to psychology first so I a teenager I I'm a teenager at that time I have a very contentious relationship with my mom we do a lot of good screaming on occasion um I am in a school system that is extremely uh uh traditional the student doesn't matter only the content matters the material matters you know um and I'm thinking you know I start to read this alternative educ ation books and I start to read uh Victor Frankl and I start to read Bruno bleheim and I start to read free children of summerh Hill and RD

[00:33:09] Lang and anti Psychiatry and I just I I become very very interested in why do we feel what we feel how come I'm having dreams about Hitler and Nazis and you know it's not my life I didn't go through that why do I have those dreams what does that do to me um and how do people get along better with their parents uh you know at that time sometimes you know when things were really really tough with her I had this idea that if I could disappear then I would see if she ever misses me you know and if she then but I had these fantasies of how can I disappear for a while and put the the fear in her that she may have lost me and then see if she actually cares about me and then I thought where does that come from why would I want to do such a thing and this is the beginning of my interest in

[00:34:04] Psychology and in you in in reading about human relationships which I then did profusely and and then I also realized I actually am quite good at this people come to confide in me all the time all my friends I I see this I I I see I see what's not visible in relationships and you know everybody thought because of my languages that I should be an interpreter or maybe a journalist or a lawyer because I could argue my case a litigator and I decided

[00:34:37] I think Psychotherapy could be a very interesting profession or a spy by the way you'd be you would have been a great spy that's right I never thought of that one so when you found yourself in Boston you're you're now going through your graduate program what is your first job career you know your first your first step into your professional career is it family therapy no my first first job was at the hospital uh as an expressive Arts therapist working on the psychiatric unit and because I had also had the whole adolescence and young adulthood in the theater and I had done a lot of puppetry and I taught to study expressive Arts therapies would be a very interesting way of bringing together the Arts as a modality as a psychotherapeutic modality and I just worked two years first in the hospital um as an expressive Arts therapist primarily with groups actually sometimes with families but mostly with groups and there was something missing I felt like there must be more plus it you're at the bottom of the totem pole when you're an expressive Arts therapist it's like you're the recreation therapist after the doctors have gone by the therapist the psychologist then you know keep them busy and I just thought that that isn't going to go very well for me you know uh to be in a profession that is not valued when I think it is so incredible something is off so I I was with Jack I was talking to

[00:36:13] Jack at the time and who was just a colleague at that moment and my and kind of mentoring me slightly through um through my Theses and he said I think you would you you would be interested in Family Therapy it's more contextual it's more anthropological it's more Intercultural it takes all the other pieces into account the way that you have done I was writing about cultural religious and racial identity I was and this was too small for me I needed a a field that I could you know that was more expansive and uh the

[00:36:51] Revolution was to begin to think in systemic terms away from the individual intra psychic model into the interpersonal and uh societal or contextual model that just opened up a gate for me and then I went to work at Mass mental and uh and slowly I thought I'm not sure that the hospital setting is the best setting for me how do how does that family therapy work in a hospital setting when you say hospital setting do you mean inpatient setting yes yes impatient so does that mean that that that you're taking care of psychiatric inpatients as individuals or you're helping families of families of inpatients yes with the with with the identified patient so I did it both inpatient and outpatient and basically yes you do sessions with the whole family but it's not just who is in the room it's how you think about what is what is a patient in a in in Family

[00:37:54] Therapy language the patient is not just the patient because they have they feel certain things or they are struggling with things inside of them the patient has a function in the family is often as assigned by the family that is the person who's allowed to struggle and suffer out loud amongst a group of athetic people you know who are just like holding it all in type thing that's just a one tiny example so you work with the system and you try to understand you know what led this person to want to commit suicide what led this person to not eat what led this person to you know destroy themselves or whatever the issues are and that notion that things are interconnected was also you know what I had experienced I knew that some of the things I was feeling wasn't just because I was born this way it was in my

[00:38:51] Dynamic with my parents with my mother in particular and um you know when you study family ter you do genograms you look at intergenerational transmission and so you constantly are studying yourself as you are learning the Paradigm and I for at no time did I think oh this just applies to me this is a fascinating other way to look at things now when you studied when you did your Masters it was focused on family therapy my masters is an expressive Arts therapist okay so that's that's what took you to your first role so one thing that is interesting to me about psychology versus uh medicine in medicine your postgraduate training your residency really prepares you for what you're going to do in your career and frankly many people don't do much training beyond that even though you know obviously one should but it seems that in Psychology you have to reinvent yourself I mean if you want to make the leap from expressive art therapy to family therapy you're not going to go back and do another master's degree or do another uh clinical you know internship or something like that so how beyond your own experience how are you finding mentors and or you know sharpening the the the tool of your trade you can be a practicing clinici who every few years decides to learn one more modality one one more theoretical

[00:40:29] Paradigm um it's endless it's it's absolutely endless you can have an interest in a topic I'm interested in the area of trauma I'm interested in eating disorders I'm interested in anxiety disorder this is one way to organize your interest but you can also say I am interested in working with families and at that time this was the he days of family therapy there were five schools of family therapy structural family therapy strategic family therapy feminist family therapy intergenerational you know these were you you you had you a good 10 years of learning just between those five right you can say I want to learn you know now there is the Neuroscience the

[00:41:11] Neuroscience have come in and they have so many interesting new things to say about how people regulate and co-regulate each other in relationships I need to know that because I want to be able to use that in my work so my frame Remains the Same I am a couple's therapist a family therapist I do individual work as well but I need to understand the new things that we know about the brain then there is a phase everybody's talking mindfulness I need to know everything that mindfulness can tell me about working in relationships then you know it's that way that you basically if you are a curious person in mental health and in Psychotherapy per se which is one practice of mental heal it is an endless endless school um and I you know there I am admire those who sometimes continue they they like I have colleagues who just like throw themselves into a new approach and spent 500 hours you know horning that skill and then you know you have cus as well Peter you know there is a an incentive that makes you continue to go and learn um but I think the knowledge of human beings which I think is not different in medicine in that sense is endless and there is a new way of thinking and then there becomes a dominant way of thinking and then for 10 years everybody thinks like that and then you know the truth of today becomes the joke of tomorrow and then we move on to a new paradigm and it's amazing how you're just you know depending on when you enter the field you basically rad the wave of the moment if I was in the 19th late 19th century I would have been a psychoanalyst and you would have thought of medicine very differently than you do today it's in a way it shows you the social construct of those fields they are sciences and they are Humanities but they are also completely immersed in the in the time of that they are you know in the context of the moment and if your

[00:43:18] CEUs are as valuable as our CEUs they don't offer too much our cus are uh they're they're some something that we do simply to maintain our lure but uh I I'm still looking for cus that that teach much valuable content yeah yeah in fact the ones at least for me that I find most valuable are the ones that are so far outside of my area of expertise that I can actually learn something but you know the ones that are generally close to what I do are are uh not that helpful which of course then makes me question how helpful the ones are that are so outside of my area because they may be equally far from what's what's what's likely reality but um so you're going along you're doing family therapy you're now transitioning obviously from inpatient to outpatient I assume you're is this when you moved from Boston back to New York yep yep and everything's going well and then how did Bill Clinton change your life so um there's a little bit of a road to Bill

[00:44:24] Clinton but um you asked me because I think this training thing ceu is a really important thing so I and I'm going to trace this back to my mother I think that because of how critical she could be I did often seek mentors I was very drawn to people who saw something good in me I was drawn to people who believed in me I saw I was drawn to people who thought I can do certain things it it just it it I would melt when somebody would uh would do that and and then I begin to actually really seek these mentors not just stumbled upon them as a counselor in a summer camp or things like that and um and this is kind of how I learned I asked people who I wanted to learn from if I could be their Shadow and I just was like a disciple that you know an apprentice that watches the craft being done and and learns from incredible clinicians I mean um then I come to New

[00:45:34] York and that's when I meet my one of my next mentors uh Salvador minuchin who I have spoken about because my two main mentors have actually passed away in the last two years one by old age and one by Suicide um so I've been thinking a lot about these things and um I basically started to uh work at the 92nd Street why and then started to work um privately um because that's what you know I it had to do with papers and immigration and license and green cards and all of that stuff and I basically did it the way that I knew my immigrant parents did you hustle you find a way you enter in you do you know that kind of a thing and uh um and I had a by the time I this Clinton affair arrives and by the time I start to write meeting yes I had a very nice

[00:46:36] Psychotherapy practice I would teach I was at NYU in the medical school as a clinical instructor I was lecturing um and I had developed a real specialty in the area of working with mixed couples and families Intercultural interracial interreligious couples and families why because the way I could build Private Practice in New York City is because I knew languages I didn't know much about therapy yet but I knew languages and these people wanted to speak their language with me and that's how this began and I had three supervisors who checked on everything I did and that's how I began um and by the time the Clinton scandal arrives I just didn't want to write a book about mixed couples that was the main thing I began to feel like I'm ready for a new subject but I need a portal topic and I like topics that open open up to me they get that that connect to theology anthropology sociology psychology you know big like you the cus take place in a different field you know I like that too and um and I don't know I just got inspired by the story because um it kind of really was this what is this American attitude to to sexuality and to sexuality as a matter of national political agenda for that matter and to you know how do I make sense of this whole thing and then

[00:48:08] I wrote this article in 2003 in an obscure magazine that was known only in our field and that changed everything around and now I've read this obscure article in this obscure magazine um and you comment on being at a conference and noting the fundamental difference that all the people at the conference who were American had versus all of the non-americans what say a bit more about

[00:48:41] that I think that one way to say it is on a on a cultural level uh there's been a real push to see sex as a risk factor in America sex itself is the risk factor whereas I think the European notion and the public health Notions in Europe is that sex is a natural part of human development being irresponsible is a risk factor that changes everything and so I don't think that clinicians in the field of psychotherapy is free from that I you know was I studied couples therapy and family therapy without one hour about the subject of sexual it how can that be in a culture where sexuality is so

[00:49:33] Central um and in the Love Culture I'm talking I'm not talking you know just the modern ideology of Love is you know puts that Dimension front and center how can we do couples therapy and not ever talk about it years something is missing you know and uh and the field had organized itself in a very interesting way to never have to talk about it because it's said if there are sexual problems it's the consequence of relationship problems therefore focus on the relationship fix the relationship and the sex will follow and that is sometimes the case but so many times not there is more to the story you know my my my thinking has always been this is not inaccurate but there is more to the story that's the way probably that sentence drives my curiosity um and you could be at an entire conference that talked about sexuality and never hear the word pleasure connection sexual connection eroticism none of these words were being used and if I looked at the literature you know the nice thing about languages is I go and I read other countries literature and I realize this is actually not the the only way to do this there is another way of looking at these things that's where I was how is sexuality a lens into society ah because I get the sense that your real interest is deeper than sexuality sexuality is a vehicle I think for you to understand more understand Society understand people yes and cultures and and yes yes yes yes so the and the and I think where

[00:51:19] I this thing really originated for me you know when you write a book there's about four or five books you read that are kind of the foundations for oh wow you could see it like that so at the time I read Octavio Pas the double flade essays on love and eroticism which is a very first of all he distinguishes sexuality and eroticism that distinction that is so important and then he looks at religion and then he analyzes religious how religion has intersected with sexuality because every religion has had to do something about sexuality here is what I began to look at was this if you look at a culture or at a civilization and you look at its most archaic rooted sometimes intransigent aspects what it holds on to many of those things will be organized around sexuality and particularly the sexuality of women and children and if you you look on the other side at revolutions radical changes Progressive changes that happen in a society often also connected to uh industrialization and scientific developments and medical developments

[00:52:41] Etc it also takes place around sexuality and so in that sense I think sexuality is a lens it's it it tells a story of the values the behaviors and the attitudes towards the body towards pleasure towards power towards connection towards uh uh the division of uh spirit and flesh or mind and body or all of those things um the women in the psychiatric hospitals of shako were not just hysterical they were victims of sexual abuse it's a very different story and they were there because some some crazy way this was still safer than to go back to the places where they had been used and misused so that's a a way of of beginning this answer MH does that make sense yeah give me an example in the United States where I mean there's an obvious example which is a sexual Liberation in the 1960s right which is a a a step function change in the political climate so I can certainly see that lens I think I've never thought about it through a technological or scientific lens with one exception the one exception to me that doesn't get enough attention is uh the development of the birth control pill um which I've always thought is one of the most underappreciated um highest Roi philanthropic absolutely right do you know that the cost of developing the birth control pill in today's dollars I believe it was less than 100 million dollar and it was mostly footed by one woman um McCormick

[00:54:40] I think was her name I'm blanking on her name I used to know the story quite well but it was an amazing story and um she basically partnered with a with a with a scientist at Harvard who whom she'd met at a dinner and he had this idea that if you gave women enough estrogen and progesterone you could actually uh you know basically suppress ovulation and and flatten the the Lal and follicular uh cycles and it was one of these things where everything came together at the right time so it was the combination of doing it in in a in a in a political environment I think prior to uh I think they started their work prior to the kenned Kennedy administration there was a lot of fear that a Catholic President uh would not you know allow allow the

[00:55:31] FDA to endorse such a thing but but nevertheless she very quietly plotted along in funding this this scientist and I can't believe I'm blanking on his name um but the two of them really did this amazing work and it's one of the few things where there's no ambiguity about the impact it had so if you look at pre-birth control versus Perth postbirth control you look at the number of women that have advanced degrees the average income of women I mean these these things changed not subtly but logarithmically um I'm trying to think of other examples uh where sexuality is so clearly tied uh you know for example like the space program or something like that are there other examples I'm just missing I mean I typically look at three of these revolutions you know um one is the democratization of birth control first and foremost it I mean it changed so much other things you know yes of course the entrance of women in the workplace and the advanced degrees but also it fundamentally changed the meaning of sexuality in romantic and longterm committed relationships uh it also allowed for the first time to separate sex from reproduction and then we began to separate reproduction from sex and now we are separating ating Anatomy from gender I mean these are conceptually revolutions they're not just you know uh the mind has to adapt to this thing you know what that actually would mean for an entire history of humanity does not understand that sexuality could ever not carry the consequence of that intercourse you know penetration could never you know be separated from the potential of child birth and unwanted child etc etc etc so the second revolution for me is the gay movement they're not in order here you know but I do think that our our in those countries where the attitude to homosexuality has shifted so many things shifted because by definition once we had contraception and once we were able to have sex before marriage we basically began to queer our relationships you know homosexuals have often gay people have become more straight in their pursuit of marriage sometimes and for all the legal and every other recognition pieces that are connected to that I mean it's it's really one of the most important shifts around that including taking it out of the DSM you know I mean depathologizing this I mean sexuality the history of sexuality is a fascinating history of society and culture when was it taken out of the

[00:58:29] DSM God I want to say 73 but I don't remember exactly I think we should have this double checked this is one of these dates that I look up every regularly and forget um but it is to me equally important because because because gays were so considered as this aberration this deviance the anti-normative and sexuality has been so much something organized around the notion of what is normal what is acceptable you know and the women's movement I mean I think that too the notion that sexuality is not just a woman's marital

[00:59:08] Duty and that sexuality is not organized around duty but around desire and the emergence of the concept of desire which completely goes hand inand with the growth of the capitalistic Society so these things are so powerfully interconnected you know um that's the three main revolutions and then you look at them across the the the the continents if you read fuk the history of sexuality which it really tells you the history of our attitudes toward children towards women towards old age towards pleasure towards you know how much agency do we have versus how how much does somebody look at us from above there and you know sees everything we do how it it's a it's the history of so many things that is being mediated through the history of sexuality that's what I mean by it's a lens into cultures MH but you probably could say the same thing about the history of medicine yeah that's I think in some way you could um I haven't thought about it that way but I

[01:00:26] I I reckon that that that because remember there was a day when medicine wasn't scientific right I mean you know I I in my mind I divide medicine into sort of you know medicine 1.0 medicine 2.0 medicine 3.0 we have these different and and obviously the the the first iterations of of medicine were entirely unscientific and so as science developed so too did better understandings of of you know not just germ Theory which is perhaps the first and most Salient Advent within medicine um but it allowed you to dismiss the idea that bad humors were the cause of so many alses um but it but it's interesting um but you're you're right I mean I just haven't thought about it through the lens of that but but certainly the genetic Revolution was a even though it hasn't panned out as very interesting from a treatment perspective

[01:01:23] I think being able to you know clone the human genome some 21 years ago uh was a big step forward from a cultural standpoint and that we now realize how similar we all are uh we're we're less dissimilar than we probably previously thought genetically so um and I think it also gave us a sense of realizing how non-deterministic genes are uh in other words it feeds into the importance of the environment more uh yeah so much more about what probably creates differences between us is is either epigenetic or simply not modulated genetically at all um so this is exactly the same way that I think in terms of psychotherapy say more well you're looking at this the the contextual factors the environment the ecology the social class the you know that the nondeterministic

[01:02:26] Gene is the same as I am looking at a non-essentialist view of a person you become by virtue of your interaction with others in certain places at certain time and with you know it it's that just opposition between environment and person that creates issues as we call them you know you are describing exactly the same thing when you say the genes are not deterministic just on their own they become by virtue of their interaction with a host of factors in the environment yes okay we we have the exact same Paradigm from you in medicine as I I bring it's not always the case but I bring it that one to my work now your work today is quite vast and while I think many people publicly who know you are familiar with your writing your talks a lot of it focuses on sexuality but yet so much of your clinical work is still rooted in you know couples therapy that doesn't necessarily involve sexuality or doesn't involve sexuality as the core issue uh absolutely individuals whose issues go far beyond sexuality or maybe don't include sexuality at all you do a lot of trauma-based therapy and uh that's not surprising based on the background in which you you came from uh you you experienced hand what it's like to grow up with trauma survivors and um you you you alluded to earlier kind of spending time reading a lot I'm sure did you did you ever come across Felix Adler's quote

[01:04:08] I think he said something to the effect of the purpose of a man's life is not happiness but worthiness um I'm I'm curious if you agree with that yes yes but I I even if you didn't have the butt I I don't understand understand the sentence that the person the purpose of a person's life is happiness happiness cannot be a purpose happiness is an outcome of multiple purposes for that matter happiness emerges out of something it's not the goal at least not in the way that I look at things but wouldn't you say that for many people they wouldn't wouldn't people come to you and say I'm not happy and that's a chief complaint oh yes yes so you know I'm a I am a clinician for almost 40 years right I write a book about sexuality and suddenly it looks like that's all I do of course it's by far not um it's a subject I find very interesting but it's one of many um now when people come and they say I'm not happy you know my first thought this is not what I say to them but uh in my mind what I'm in in in line of this historical perspective itive we take I'm thinking this is such an interesting thing right for so long happiness belonged to the Heavens to the afterlife basically

[01:05:36] You Suffer Well on Earth and if you've done a good job at that you may get rewarded later when did we bring happiness to earth when did and this is a a book actually called Happiness uh that I I met the auter whose name now escapes me at a conference and he was was telling me that one of the very interesting developments was how did the

[01:05:59] Western parent when you ask what do you want the most for your child the main thing they will say is I want my kids to be happy of course yes that seems like that sounds like a knee-jerk reaction I I I I would catch myself saying that right they don't want them to be healthy right because you know this well you could argue we almost take it for granted right maybe that's such a part of us culture exactly because you know your thing about the the the about the contraception is how much contraception not only changed female sexuality and couple sexuality but it also changed the meaning of the child when you have 10 versus one I tell you the child has a very different role in the family um plus you needed to make sure that kids could live past age five and that you were not leaving with child mortality in as a massive phenomenon and then you can to talk about early attachment and all those things you know it needed kids who survive for us to develop attachment theories like this with early childhood and look at the Child Development so completely different so when I when people say I want my kids to be happy it needs you to know that it's a given they are healthy that's OB after after them being healthy what's the next thing you want or you don't want them to give good people you know decent human beings people who that is a framework that you know that that also is obvious you know because the notion is if they feel good about themselves they will be good to others that that's the new framework that self-esteem becomes the root of this thing and not values you know that's a that's a new paradigm right um so when people say they're not happy we start a long conversation before we go there which I want to come back to I want to go back to this point of when did that transition take place towards the the self-esteem view of the world because I again I I think back to my parents who are also immigrants and I it's just a different world right

[01:08:11] I mean the world they came from you never puffed your chest out your parents never puffed your chest out and told you how wonderful you were and how special you were and uh you know Bill Maher who is absolutely hands down one of my favorite commentators on this subject says you know we live in a world today where if a teacher complains that the child is doing something bad in class the parent attacks the teacher and you know when I was growing up if the teacher complained to my parents I was always assumed to be wrong even when I wasn't by the way there were sometimes when the teacher was wrong but but but there was this there has been this transition towards the child is always right self-esteem is the most important thing what what what drove that

[01:08:56] I think that what we have is on the rise of individualism that goes handin hand with modern economies uh and modern psychology you know for most of traditional life basically you lived as part of a community you were uh your sense of identity your sense of belonging your sense of continuity it was all assigned to you all the big decisions basically were made for you what you were going to do if you were going to be in the priesthood in the military or on the land I mean um and we had very little freedom but we had a lot more certainty of some sort and um you got your happiness or your sense of well-being from doing the things that were expected from you that's probably where the values actually of your parents too if you provided well for your family if you were able to take care of your loved ones if you were an upstanding person in the community if people respected you and invited you at their table you were happy and we move to a system in which the individual becomes the center not the community and you have a lot more freedom for the first time but also a lot more uncertainty and a lot more self-doubt on the other side of self-esteem is self-doubt and you have to make all the big decisions yourself now and therefore you need a lot of certainty to know that it is the right decision you're not just part of a legacy that says this is how we do it this is the transmission of what this is supposed to mean how this looks like what are the protocols it's all up for you now in this world of innovation now when does it start I think it there's different stages you know Romanticism is already a beginning of that too but end of the 19th century but the 60s the grow in the in in our in our psychology in modern psychology it really is the beginning of the growth movement this notion that we can change ourselves the goal is no more to stay connected to the past and to the tradition and to the but in the transmission the goal becomes to be able to innovate to change oneself to uproot oneself to leave to you know to go and be in a whole different part of the country in order to do more and um and that's begins to really change the notion of when you are a 2-year-old I'm not just expecting you to do by learning what and seeing what everybody else is doing that's a piece of it but I'm also saying when you are I say use your word words tell me what you want what do you want to eat what do you want to wear because I have a sense that if I give you that notion of knowing thyself and being able to make clear affirmative statements about it that this is going to build your sense of self and your sense of confidence now this is a western model let's be very clear but that starts from the beginning

[01:12:21] I am going to build that individual that becomes my child now given that for virtually all of our evolutionary history that was not the case so much of our identity was based on our group we we weren't looking to leave our tribe our relationships with the others around us were at least as important if not more important than our relationship with ourself and what you're describing is is is quite a recent phenomenon and I I always ask this question through the lens of you know I don't think evolutionary biology teaches us everything but I always like asking the question first through that lens you know for example when you introduce a new food that's never been around it can have bad consequences right if it's we didn't if our body never you know adapted to you know sugars in the quantities we're consuming them now uh it doesn't mean it's bad in an absolute sense give us another million years and we might catch up but you know we're not going to catch up in 30 years so similarly does this pose a challenge uh let me make it even put a more negative veilance on that does it pose a concern for you um that we're in Uncharted

[01:13:41] Territory with respect to this this

[01:13:49] model I can answer this on a personal level and I can answer this on a professional level right I mean we we do actually know the consequences of a of how child wearing is creating strengths and vulnerabilities in our generation right um it is interesting that we suddenly have a proliferation of work and research on the concept of grit why do we research grit today because there is this there's an absence of grit in in in growing up yes yes because we have mush and there's a bit too much mush sometimes and so that mush needs to be strengthened into grit you know we we study things because we start to realize that they that we need more of them and that we've lost something and where has it gone and what has it morphed into Etc I mean you and I do not raise our children at all the way we were raised um and and our parents tried very hard to stay loyal to those who had raised them but then also to see what was happening around them and because they were immigrants and that's what immigrant parents often do they're they have they own you know the past and the and the future um and on some things they want actually to do what the local culture does because they find that something that they appreciate and on other things they are a gas and they think you know I'm going to do it the way I have known it and I think we have not immigrated but culturally we are also in transition in terms of childbearing um there's a lot of questions today about um you know and these are also class issues yeah this is uh we have to be very mindful of that as well but there are questions about what does it mean to have a system in which um there is one two children for two parents who often are disconnected from their grandparents live far away have full-time jobs and need to assume you know all those roles and it you know and if you add the pandemic to it and the confinement you get a real picture of of of what those stressors are like yeah um what does it mean um when when we Sol liit the opinions the feelings the thoughts of the young ones because we believe that it is important for them to know them to be able to communicate and to be able to expect that adults will change the plan to accommodate to the will and the feelings of those little ones and we take it for granted every second book today is not written to make the life of the parent better or easier easier is a better word it is written through the lens of what does the child need now the books until the 60s even you know Spock is the real transition

[01:17:07] Point here where all written child wearing books are another good L you know entrance into cultural changes um and this is more recent than evolutionary biology this is just a few decades you know where the books before were basically what we thought was is that a child it was like the Russo view right a child comes into the world and your role is to Shepherd this child through the pre-established stages of development that are Universal and you and and you just have to help the kid go through those stages it doesn't really change much if you do this or if you do that that's how Child Development was conceptualized and it moved to a otion where Child Development is much more flexible and much more responsive to the to the circumstances and to the kind of input that the parents put in and so now if you listen to Mozart in you know while you're pregnant you could actually maybe develop some musical taste in utero and you know we this is completely non-biological this is completely cultural and what I do with my kid other people who I leave my child in the care of need to be able to do so we need Mass reproducible child r techniques this this is a very important shift for example in terms of child development that is a preset number of stages that are just there and the kid goes through them versus Child

[01:18:38] Development that is completely in the hands of the person who raises the child what what what is the impact of that then to the patient who arrives in your office who is a product of that child rearing the impact is how the narratives get created who is responsible for my unhappiness why am I unhappy if you want to take the unhappy you know presenting issue yeah and have

[01:19:08] I always been unhappy and how did people respond to my unhappiness how alone did I feel with my unhappiness in a in an environment where you expect your parents to be attuned to you if they are not you will experience your aloneness your isolation your emotional disconnection very different than in an environment where that the Attunement of your parents is really not part of your expectation on an emotional level of what parents are you get that Attunement maybe from your grandmother or from your auntie from you know from other parental figures who can be kind and sweet because your parent is there to make the rule and to make the discipline and to shape you that's two different models so I I I keep that model in my head when a person comes in and I also know where they're coming from and what are the you know what were their expectations what did you think your parents what did you want that they would do or your whoever were the people that were in charge of you um and and um how much do you blame them how much um I mean look I was working yesterday with a a son who feels that his father has been always critical of him that he can never please him enough that he could never do good enough for him and I was thinking you know a 100 years ago would there have been such a son yes but he would have probably never thought to have said anything right well he wouldn't have had a therapist to go talk about this with and to think that you know the father has to come and apologize to him I'm thinking this is very interesting you know um and the father uh on some level does think he did something um challenging um but you know the parent of a 100 years ago would have said I did the best

[01:21:30] I could I you know my role is not to pump you up my role is not to make you feel good about yourself my role is to to make you into a responsible person who takes your role seriously and um and does for others that what is expected from you that's my role my role is not to make you happy um these conversations take place all the time at this moment because there are generational differences and cultural differences I mean cultural as in the conception of what is a parent what is the role of a parent what do we expect should happen between parents and children little ones and older ones and it's an this changes nonstop it moves it moves it moves especially with the father because the the biggest one of the biggest changes that has taken place in Modern Family Western families is the rise of the role of the Father the father not just as a material provider but the father as an emotional unit which coincides with the woman going to work as well so that you know they can both be material providers and emotional caregivers this this one to me is very interesting right I I I I don't I'm saying a lot of things in well this particular issue around around around the the role of the father because you know I mean I think back to when I grew up I mean I I can hearken to countless discussions between my parents where you know there would be an argument over why wasn't my dad ever watching me at a sporting event or going to a parent teacher night or doing anything that involved being a part of my life and the reality of it it was he worked 14 hours a day six days a week and on the seventh day he worked worked maybe 8 hours so there was simply no time for him to do those things and he he was I mean frankly incredulous that he would even be asked to do such a thing but he was at your wedding yes he was at my wedding right and he was at was he at your graduation yes he uh not high school but but college and medical school no of course not high school high school is a you know he he had a few major dates where he knew the father shows up there and his point was I am doing the thing that I am supposed to be doing that's right this business of working is that is I'm not you know he would say I don't do this for me I do this for you that's right and you can imagine that he was an extension of the culture he grew up in where you know it was it was harsh I mean it was very harsh um and so now we're and I and I'm I'm sure there are many people my age who grew up in that environment and are now being confronted as the ones to change that as the ones that will not simply be able to mirror the the environment they grew up in right but first of all your dad is still the majority of fathers on this planet today that notion that you work to take care of your family and when you work all these hours it's for them and you come to a few major events um not because you don't care about the others but the others are not you have not received a license to think that the others are as important isn't it fascinating that the high school graduation is not considered something where the father should be at this is not things that your father decided alone this is totally headed down pass down through generations now comes your generation and you will attend more things right you will attend more games more birthdays more graduations you have a license a collective cultural license to think of more things as places where you are expected to be at B not be frond at for what is he doing here where shouldn't he be at work kind of thing instead but there is still a lot a lot a lot of other places where

[01:26:01] Mom will dominate culturally and people expect her to be there and not you it's funny you say something there about uh why is he here I used to have this reaction when I was growing up and I would go to my friend's homes and their dads would be home for dinner and their dads would be around on weekends and my reaction was not why don't I have this my reaction was why are their dads so lazy what what is it with these lazy men who come home at five or six o'clock and have dinner and then watch TV why aren't they working I mean this is this is really how I felt and I I I just couldn't understand this idea that a guy would sit around on a Saturday and mow the lawn and drink a beer and watch some sports that struck me as Peter but that's not just how you felt that's how you were taught and that's how your father was taught because he needed some way to justify why he was working himself to the ground so you know for if you want to get a man to work day and night you have to make him feel that this is what real men do this is what responsible fathers look like this is what people who are driven do this is the name of your podcast the drive you know if not you need to create a consonance between the behavior and the belief and those are cultural systems and then the son in order to accept that his dad is never there he needs to internalize that system too because otherwise he would say I miss my dad rather than I'm proud I have a real hardworking father he's never there but he's the best father because that's how

[01:27:55] I've learned it to I've put it together like this and then when I see that guy who's home at six o'clock I'm thinking not not a Ser not serious not serious not serious let's talk about about these narratives because I I'm very interested in these sort of intra and Inter relational narratives that come in and out of your office um again I there's a form of psychotherapy I'm sure that only deals with the relationship with one self and undoubtedly there must be a lot of good that comes from that but you don't view it as a vacuum right you don't really think that it is possible to Simply Better one's life by bettering your relationship with yourself is that a fair assessment yes and I would say that the very framework of bettering your relationship with yourself is in itself a cultural narrative that's a constru that's exactly what happened in the last 50 years suddenly this thing you know bettering your relationship with yourself feeling good about myself you know um becomes a an organizing principle rather than feeling good about how I act towards others is my organizing principle or feeling good about how I stand you know below God is my organizing principle so I think that this there's an emphasis right no nobody just looks at the self and doesn't see it the relationships to others but there's an emphasis and one my emphasis is the the constant dual track between the intra personal and the interpersonal between what's happening inside and how what is happening inside is affecting my relationship with others I can't think about one without thinking about the other because I don't fundamentally believe that one can know oneself without knowing oneself in relationships to other now that is a construct too it happens to be the one that I work and think by but I that is ad that is not a truth that just is the way that I organize re relational thinking I think of people as relational beings um and when you talk about your father and especially when you talk about the way that you looked at these other men to me this is a beautiful example of how you you say this is how I felt and I know that your feeling sits on a cultural message that the narratives the frames with which we interpret and give meaning and give value that the things that are happening to us they don't just come from us they come from a combination of the collective manufacturing and the personal responses to it it's always both at is that clear it it actually is and and to me one of the most as an outsider one of the most difficult aspects of what you do must be changing a narrative because when somebody comes in with a narrative it's it seems almost hardwired which is not to say they were born with it of course right this gets gets back to what's predetermined and what is not but when a person shows up in your office it's often in the same way that they show up to the doctor very few people come to the doctor when everything is perfect to say hey I'm just here for some preventative care I feel so good I just want to make sure I feel this good in 20 years what can you do for me similarly I I guess most people aren't showing up in your office saying I've never felt better my relationships are amazing I want to keep this going so there's a negative selection for people who walk into your life which is on some level they must have a narrative that has failed that has that has led them astray uh either a narrative about themsel a narrative about others and probably more likely a combination of these those narratives are probably often quite entrenched yep so how do you go about challenging them so you're right both modern medicine no not modern medicine today and Psychotherapy are problem ridden contexts they're problem ridden narratives if you don't have a problem there's no reason to come to me or to you that's right if you don't have a diagnosis code I can't even charge your insurance company for you to be here same here same here so that is that is a cultural you know construct right that is a narrative you know so people come to therapy to talk about their problems they don't go to therapy if things are fine this is a very important piece of information by the way for couple's therapy because couples therapy is in a bind relationship therapy is a but especially couples therapy is in a bind because on the one hand so many people come way too late way too late stuff has been been so entrenched and you kind of want to say why didn't you come five years ago on the other end if they would come when things are still okay or somewhat okay on occasion then what's the problem that you're already going to therapy now this is fascinating it's like you can't go if it's good but then when you go when it's really bad you should have come and it things were really better okay so this is one thing I think what you've just articulated is probably the core of a lot of my work it is not the core of all Psychotherapy work I think there are different ways to enter the story what I mean by the story is the life of people I believe that our relationships are a story we tell stories about our relationships and I think that when I I remember in the First episodes of where should we begin I said when people come to me me into my office this is you know

[01:34:26] I was I was trying to explain to the people I was producing the podcast with what is my couple's work and I said people come to me with a story at the end of the first session the only goal of the first session is for them to leave with another story or with a sense that there can be another story I was about to say your first goal strikes me as far too ambitious for one session I would think even casting doubt that there could be you know casting doubt on that narrative and suggesting there may be an alternative one would be an amazing outcome for two hours yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about doubt and hope yeah so an enormous part of my work is to reframe I think that this is an amazing piece why because it's not just an intellectual thing in my head it's because I think that words shape the experience the way I tell the story is going to create the way I feel about the story and then it's going to create the way I therefore will act upon the story that I think there is if I talk with you now and in my mind

[01:35:43] I have this notion he doesn't really care about me he doesn't really value me he's just doing this to to be nice he would have stopped this an hour ago if he could I have no idea I think he disagrees with everything he has said he really doesn't think I have anything interesting to say he's so sorry he invited me I mean yeah this instantly fills my belly so this is not just a thought this is not just a feeling this is also an embodied experience so I'm in my in my belly now

[01:36:26] I have this this knot you know and how am I going to you know what am I going to do now and I just feel so bad about myself and I don't know how to talk to him and you know and then it's going to influence how I'm going to talk next and now I'm going to start to talk all too long and too much because because I'm actually feeling unsure and then my insecurity makes me talk more and I'm rambling and I'm all over the place and he's even more now thinking that I am not interesting and you know I mean this is all this could all go into my head right now you know my narrative that one phrase becomes my experience and my experience becomes the motor for my behavior and the motor for my behavior is going to land me probably in a place that is often the exact opposite place of where I actually want to go that's a narrative now if I sit here and

[01:37:27] I think Peter is really happy we're doing this he's been waiting for this for so long and I I think he's you know he had a doubt for a moment he was wondering should we should we not and and I I think he's he's he's feeling good that we did it that is going to completely change my entire experience now maybe this example isn't a great one but does it matter which of those is reality but the reality is the story you tell that's my point right is it for reality yeah your story is independent of how I feel that's right it's a projection it's what I imagine it's how I've internalized it it's how I think my mother did or did not love me or my dad or my brother or whoever you know yes it it the the interesting thing is is it reality completely because it's the one that is dictating my life that's why it is reality not because there's a factual truth to this so the reframe is not that this is more true what I teach my students I say when you reframe the only way that you know it's a good reframe is because the other person bites on it takes it likes it says oh I prefer to live by this view you know your father wasn't neglecting you because he was away 14 hours a week your father did this because he thought that this is his total Devotion to his family is to actually never be there is the ultimate presence and devotion now do we have a different feeling about you that and about what happened to you

[01:39:23] I'm just playing with this here right yeah yeah yeah of course of course um I suspect there are so many patterns that you see in these narratives and like if you think of the the the all of these all of the negatively valenced emotions right depression anxiety sadness anger all of the things that can not just hurt a person but hurt their relationships

[01:39:53] I'm curious as to what what are some of the common themes that you see around those and how you begin to chip away at the armor of a person's firmly held beliefs that are no longer serving them let's go back to your word before about worthiness what I just played out here with you are probably two of the most important narratives the one the first narrative is The

[01:40:27] Narrative of being unwanted fundamentally unwanted not just because born not wanted but unwanted unloved uncared for undervalued unappreciated unseen un and something after and I can bring this from my childhood I can bring this from the way that I grew up I can bring this from the way that other ks in my classroom never ever looked at me there's Lo loads of places where this emerged and then grew inside of me and becomes the lens through which I see myself in the world the second narrative where I think I think I think it's okay I think you know it may not yet be where it wants it to be you know but I'm giving

[01:41:20] I'm not in a in a state of self- condemnation I actually am looking for the appreciation I'm looking for the acceptance I I'm looking and experiencing that acceptance that I am worthy that there's a reason I'm here today there's you know all of that I think those two are probably the most fundamental of our narratives and they are rooted in trauma and in neglect and in you know that having had too much of something or too little of something right this is pretty much where where trauma sits um to me that's the dominant and it will influence my anger my sadness my loneliness my sense of shall I tell him what I think or what I feel do people even care does it matter would they miss me if I wasn't around you know my despair all of these bigger pieces you can see the way that they are interconnected to this fundamental is there a reason for me to be here on this planet you know for being alive do people think of me when I'm not there do

[01:42:30] I exist inside others do they want good for me you know versus the opposite of all of that I to me they're not that complicated and then the stories thousands of stories multitude of different stories can be brought back to these two fun mental pieces similar with do I experience a sense of agency and control over my life can I make changes you know or am I completely at the mercy of I have very little power I

[01:43:11] I live with a sense of powerlessness nothing I will do will make a difference those two are directly connected to the first two by the way is there anything adaptive about that narrative because you know so much of the the trauma response is initially adaptive right if and again if we use the childhood trauma uh you know for example in the case of your mother we could probably look at many of her responses once she survived these concentration camps and say wow you know even though the through the lens we would look back we would say those were really Mal adaptive behaviors they actually had a very adaptive uh root or origin they protected her in a way to they they they shielded her from subsequent pain when you in in the examples you just gave of feeling unworthy or unwanted what's the adaptation there I don't understand how that is even at an emotional level I'm not disagreeing with it I'm just trying to understand what the adapt is and why it's so because usually when something is so prominent there's a reason for it right or at least that's myologic explanation of course and and and right now you know we've just done I I with the same information that we just shared

[01:44:40] I could do a narrative analysis an attachment analysis A trauma analysis I mean this is one lens one reading of this thing so I'll give you a personal there actually two personal examples that that that that just came to me one I probably have I don't even know when if if I have talked but is I sit with a patient one day who is also a child of Holocaust

[01:45:07] Survivors like me and he's telling me by age eight I made sure my kids can take a train and be on a bus and all of that and he says to me I'm very protective of my children and I'm thinking to myself you're so lucky you're talking to me because I too have that same Distortion protective is not I make sure that I'm not leaving my 8-year-old alone on a plane I send my seven-year-old alone on a plane because in my parents' book to be protective was not to be there for you to be protective was to make sure that you would know to survive if they were not there and it was the way I was raised and in many ways I did pieces of that with my own children as well it's like I wanted them to be able to manage on their own in case I'm not there you know manage on their own really meant survive you know we didn't use those words but that that's what the Legacy was underneath this my parents also without ever saying this you know but told enough stories that let you think that in the camps the vulnerable died and so when my children exhibit vulnerability it scares me so much it did because I've worked a lot on this that I sometimes wouldn't know how to just respond and just you know in a simple basic empathetic way I was so scared I wanted to tough them up that they would say to me why can't you know like they joke now with me that if they you know if they were not with what is it in American in 42 degree fever then they could go and do whatever they needed to do if you're not dying then there is no reason to stay in your bed I mean you know I had that mentality that if you have to be really really really sick to not go to school and things like that you know and uh and and now they laugh but I know that there were probably moments where they wished I would just say come I'll put you a cold compress on your head which I did too but I didn't do it from that place of oh my little one you know I was more okay that's what you need to do in order to get you back out you know I was grit driven if if you want in in in that sense so I that was adaptive right it it was it was adaptive for her and then it was no longer adaptive for meh because we're not in the camps and I don't need to raise them to survive as if we're in the Holocaust because we're not in the Holocaust and that is the most important piece around trauma work is to understand that your reaction is the reaction as if the past is happening right now and in fact it isn't happening right now and to be able to then create the ground underneath you to put a reality a different way of experiencing yourself you know that is not fed by all the horrible things that happened to you then that is a part of the trauma healing work and that transition I I think for anyone who's gone through it is it's really quite a process because it's it requires pausing and for many people who are in adaptation mode there's no room for pausing right once you have an adaptation to cope with trauma it's selects right it's it's it's it's reinforcing itself it's making you stronger and stronger and pushing you further and further and you might miss the fact that it's become maladaptive it's the the transition from it being adaptive to maladaptive can be so far in the rearview mirror you've entirely missed it and I think this is where this idea of the relationships with others starts to become the mirror through which you can actually be confronted with something that says hey there's something wrong here you know yes this worked for you before when you had no other responsibility this maybe worked for you when you didn't have a family but now that you have a family this is no longer uh adaptive yes I use the word generally it was useful then you badly needed it but it's not it it's not serving you now you your reality has changed and you're still holding an umbrella even though there is no rain you know another way of saying it is a lot of people this is if you go to the survivors but I think you can translate it often felt that it was very difficult for them to get close to their children they had lost children they had lost parents they had lost siblings how what basis will I allow myself to get close to anybody or love somebody again now here they had these kids but they couldn't get close to them because if I don't get too close then I won't be in such pain when I lose you now that never you know it didn't keep the dead closer it didn't create a good relationship with the children who constantly felt like there is nothing I can do to win your love because I will never replace you your dead ones and so this idea that when you've had loss and massive disruptions and and and and injured attachments that you protect yourself by not coming too close to the other people now I'm going to go back to your original question it may even have been adaptive for you but in your relationship with your child it's become a It's been a major lack so intrapersonally I understand it interpersonally it's problematic it's not adaptive interpersonally hence I need the parent or the whoever is on this side to understand the effect of how you protect yourself on your child and I need you the child to understand that what your parent is doing isn't n actually because of who you are but it's because of what happened to them this is did you get this this could be a couple now I just did it with parent and child I completely get it and

[01:52:03] I now want to ask a question about the ability of the person who is able to make that transition versus that who is not so if you look at 100 women with breast cancer um who all receive comparable standard of care depending on the stage at which they're diagnosed it's very clear to predict how many will live and how many will not and truthfully it really comes down only to the biology of their cancer and I know that's a very unpopular thing to say um but I really do not believe that the person who lived wanted it more and the person who died gave up I I've seen too many people who fought like hell who died and I've seen too many miserable sons of [ __ ] who didn't give a damn who lived so the reality of it is uh survivorship in cancer comes down to a lot of luck and a lot of biology of the tumor and things like that but in your line of work and what you're just describing very specifically for this this transition right that person who goes from having traits and narratives and coping mechanisms that protected them at a time and are now either hurting them and or hurting their relationships why are some people able to do the hard work that's necessary to make the change and others not what are the predictive factors of that I think this is one of the most difficult questions and why in the same family did one person land here and the other person with the same circumstances took all of that for this person it became everything that drove them and for this person it became everything that broke them it is a question I ask myself so often so I I can Riff on it but honestly I do not know it's one of the

[01:54:16] Mysteries it's multifactorial is for sure it's it's not the same thing each time your example is so nice and clean well and and I should clarify in my example I think there are lots of things the patient can do I think their nutrition matters exercise matters management of stress I think the point I wanted to make is their will I don't believe matters you know I I whereas I wonder how much willpower or desire to improve by itself is the the critical ingredient here or if in times that's insufficient but interpersonally will doesn't just exist inside one person but you have once said that the key to maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong on this but didn't you once say that the key to couple's therapy is the moment that each partner is less interested in what the other one is doing wrong and more interested in how they can be better or something to that effect yes yes absolutely absolutely um so now I come to therapy and I've decided that I want I do want to talk about what

[01:55:30] I have been doing or I want to talk about the ways in which I have stayed far or the ways in which I've never said to you I love you or the ways in which I even tell you about how I've lost so many people important in my life I don't even know I don't really know what it means to love I don't trust that when I love it's there to stay I actually even have veloped a view that when I love someone he dies or they if I love something it breaks it destroys it disappears you know this can go very far this notion right this is now my will is

[01:56:05] I'm coming to talk to you about this whole part but my will now the moment I have said something is now public domain and now it will all depend the the shape of my will from here on is going to in part what I'm holding and in part how you are responding if your response to me is now you're telling me all of this why be is it because because your wife is about to leave you is it because

[01:56:38] I put you an ultimatum is because your son hasn't talked to you in two years is it you know now you're telling me that instantly is going to do something to my Goodwill let's even put it like that my ownership my respons responsibility my vulnerability by just putting myself out there if instead you say nothing and I'm like are you hearing this how are you receiving this I need to sit with this for a while this is thank you but I do need to sit with this I'm not prepared to just say I forgive you it it takes a little more for me you know or number three I say everything you've just said was all about you and I appreciate that but you haven't said much about how that you think that this has had an effect on me and I need to know that you have a sense of what that did to me you're being absent or critical or belligerent or violent or you know too little or too much of something version four I really appreciate you're saying this then this by the way can be in one session or over four months right it's a but in the next version I say I've been wanting to hear you talk about that I I I've done my own work and

[01:58:06] I know that a part of your distance from me is because of what happened to you and that it's not because I had an A or a b or a c that this is not any of this all four responses will shake the will this will is not you know one fixed what you call the predetermined Gene you know this will is completely malleable and will change and and express itself differently at the mercy of the response of the other person and obviously why all of this matters is is something you and I have spoken about in the past which is everything we're talking about factors into longevity not just in sort of a biochemical sense right where in theory if your relationships are better your hormone levels would be better and cortisol levels would be lower and all of these things would be better but in just a more fundamental

[01:59:18] Stark manner what advantage is there to living longer if your relationships are poor and the quality of your relationships therefore determines the quality of your life now I I'm a full convert to that right that's something that you know five years ago I would have never given a thought to I mean not for you know just was not even in my uh ballpark of thought and today of course I believe it emphatically to me one of the things that's been interesting is learning that if that is true there needs to be a new comfort in sitting with uncomfortable emotions that the ability to sit in discomfort must be a new trait so I think if I use myself as an example historically anytime I felt uncomfortable I had a tool to numb it to get away from it to distract myself from it so anything that I didn't like emotionally I had a very quick Band-Aid for such that I never had to sit in discomfort and what would you do it would depend but it was usually you know

[02:00:36] I it could be anything from binge purchasing watches uh you know OBS you know exercising obsessively um anger outbursts of anger which sounds paradoxical you wouldn't think of that as a tool to numb discomfort but of course as I talked about on the podcast with Terry reel anger is very transiently quite numbing right there in the in the immediate in the immediate moment of an outburst of anger it actually squelches the feeling of inadequacy and lock loss of control better S right but if you but but if you want to move into this to this this quality of life where now all of a sudden your relationships are important you you you realize very quickly there are times when you have to be uncomfortable and you have to sit in that um there's a a psychologist Susan

[02:01:32] Davis or something she gave a TED Talk Susan David David yeah Susan Davis and she gave a TED Talk and I really liked it because she said something to the effect of she said it much more eloquently but the gist of it is the admission you have to pay to a meaningful life is is being uncomfortable is is being able to sit in uncomfortable emotions and she made a very funny comment in the talk which was if you tell me you don't want to feel blank you know blank being some uncomfortable emotion then I tell you you have a dead person's goals um it you know I probably saw that talk three or four years ago it was very profound to me um how how does that factor into your work how do you couldn't agree with her more actually I Susan David was a guest on my on my training platform on sessions recently and and when she says it I I couldn't agree with her more but it's it's a very basic thought of anybody who does

[02:02:35] Psychotherapy you know is is how Okay so the anybody who does Psychotherapy as I understand Psychotherapy okay which is not my goal is not to make you happy which is to to make it look like you never going to have any of these feelings CU that's that person that came in saying I'm unhappy would love to not have those feelings sometimes sometimes not always

[02:03:00] H so the idea that you know this is what you feel and that doesn't mean you have to act on it or do something or chase them away or make it disappear this is your experience in this moment now we can do a lot of things with this experience we can understand it we can name it first of all we can name it we can frame it we can understand it we can put it in context we can celebrate it we can write about it we can physicalize it we can do a lot of things with this experience these feelings that you're having and you need to understand that sometimes they will just come true they will pass through you and then they will get out to the other side you don't have to squelch them you don't have to J judge them you don't have to be contemptuous of them I don't say it in those words but this this is the the the idea you don't have to numb them that's the thing that you because you were numbing them not just because you were numbing them you were numbing because you were judging because you didn't think you should be feeling those things because what's wrong with you that you have those things so there was the contempt in it as well there's a lot of things very very very very quick before you've even gone to buy your next watch or whatever thing you were doing so sitting you know with your inner life and remaining somewhat curious and kind to your inner life and some call it today self-compassion but sometimes it's not necessarily always compassionate but at least it's not um contemptuous and judgmental of your inner life um or despairing of it or terrified by it that it will never go away that it will never leave you that this is your state forever now

[02:04:58] Etc um this is psychotherapy this is individual therapy for me this for me I'm going to really put myself for the kind of work I do this is the essence of a lot of the individual work um fascinatingly when I see somebody alone and then I get to see them with their partner and now I see how all those things play out not just inside of you but in between the two of you it's a whole other story it's like I've just spent time in one room of the house and I didn't even know there was a whole anex to that house and this is when you understand the difference between the relational thinking which Terry of course is one of the main teachers of and the individual perspective and I think that the real importance today is for most of us to be able to not just live in one you know the the the the the mistake of a lot of the systemic thinkers was that they stopped thinking about the individual and the internal life it was all you know system system stinking that didn't go and the mistake sometimes or the the lack in people who have just an individual perspective is that they're not looking like you talk about the gene in context you know um and that integration is where my the

[02:06:25] Nexus of my work sits would you agree with the following statements so um a a very very close friend of mine Jim coachela you know what's very weird Peter I'm used to hearing what you have what you think about what I say and this time it's like you move on to the next question it made me think of this other thing right it made me think of this this this idea that I've been really internalizing and I'm curious if you agree with it so um so this is a friend of mine Jim coachela who's a a wonderful psychologist though

[02:07:02] I've never worked with him in that capacity he's a friend said something to me once of the effect you can't believe everything you think you can't believe everything you feel the mind is a very dangerous organ and I had never contemplated that until he said it right I I had I had contemplated the first half of it because that's what mindfulness meditation teaches you that you can't believe everything you think right as you as you separate yourself from your

[02:07:33] Consciousness you begin to realize that you have a constant internal monologue and it is not the same as you you are not your thoughts but it's when he layered on this second piece which is and you can't even believe everything you feel and and then he pointed out basically look the mind can be very dangerous sometimes and then takes me back to things that you've said which is a lot of these narratives that we have about ourselves and others are surprisingly well-worn and they're not novel even though for any individual in the throws of pain they feel incredibly unique no one else could possibly feel the way I feel right now I completely agree with him um because the mind creates narratives you know um it's a different way of saying of saying the same you know um of saying the same I

[02:08:35] I you know it's it's a play on when you say you're not your thoughts it's short it's a Shand yeah right at the same time I could say but subjectively you know you produ you manufacture your thoughts and your thoughts Define you but it's not immutable these are constructs what I mean by construct is it's it's creations and Creations can be changed with New

[02:09:05] Creations you can't totally believe what you feel because sometimes your mind is making you believe the feeling for example your mind can make you believe that you feel at this point nothing a you can feel nothing because you're Frozen B you can feel nothing because you're trying very hard not to show anybody how upset you are three you're trying to make it look like you you're not attached to this person at all and if you don't if you want to break up with me no big deal I was never that in love with you anyway um and this is the mind trying to pretend that it knows my feelings and it wants to convince me that I'm not hurt

[02:09:52] I'm not hurt I'm not hurt at all and the more a person says something like that to me and the more I want to go and hold them and press right there on those places those bony handles where so much of that sad fragile hurt wound sits and then just you know I've had people in my room where the tears are literally streaming down their face and they're saying I'm not hurt and I'm looking at them and I'm saying the fracture inside the you know one part of you doesn't know the other part of you in literal terms your eyes don't know that they're tearing your heart doesn't know that it's aching this is our work to me this makes sense and it stands in a bit of a contrast to

[02:10:51] I think something that that Susan David once said which is the key to resilience is the radical acceptance of all emotion and do you see those as compatible beliefs the key to resilience is AC is the radical acceptance of all our emotions um so the to me there's a lot of Truth in that statement but it presumes a certain definition of the word resilience and it it is a view of resilience as internal traits personality traits and that's a very individualistic perspective on resilience like you are a resilient person you know how to face adversity you know there are many definitions of resilience actually you know this is one but uh resilience is also our ability to to to face adversity in a way that allows us to rebound and then to re-engage with life that would be when I say my parents were resilient that would be another definition of resilient it wasn't about just the things inside of them it was a combination of what I said the collective support the community the people who helped them the luck you know what they had experienced before the war how they grew up you know lots of different things a collective definition of resilience is our ability to tap into the collective resources it's actually not what's inside of you it's what's around you that too is resilience sometimes resilience is actually the ability to know and to go and ask for help I'll give you a very beautiful example that that my husband was telling me recently about a a young man um B basically I forgot the details now but it's it's something about how guilty he feels this is a I wish I I will not mess up it's like telling a joke when you not arrive to the end right um but the the man feels tremendous guilt because he he actually went to call the police at the neighbor's house because of the violence that was in the house and he has carried this as the ultimate betrayal all the time what what he didn't take into consideration is that it actually prevented the father from doing something even worse and I forgot what that thing was and when the therapist just said to him you know you what you think was about how could I run out of the house at that moment and leave my mother with my father you actually by calling the police at that moment were able to bring other people in that could do more than what you could do as a 9-year-old and what you did was one of the most loving things you could have done for your mother now that's a reframe now is it true it only depends if the person bites if they if they take that story in and that story replaces another story and gives them a completely different sense of what they did and what it meant and what the consequences were therefore it is true true not because it has any truth in absolutes that's what I mean by narrative that person now leaves the session and he's thinking about what I thought was the worst actually was probably the kindest I have not been that bad person

[02:14:43] I was young and I tried to do this and blah blah blah it goes goes on like that and I that is is a different description of resilience you see and a different description of the power of narrative in resilience than just to see it as um it's the radical acceptance of all emotions I think it's a truism it's there's a truth in that statement but it it doesn't capture the the way that I like to Define resilience it's probably a better way of saying what problem about the Human

[02:15:15] Condition are you still most curious about you know when you think about the you're you're a person who you know is endlessly curious and is constantly evolving um what is the next Frontier for you clinically you know there's two I could answer it in in in topic and I can answer it in in like yesterday I did a session and I at the end of the session

[02:15:40] I said to the person it took us three years to get here I feel like we're finally you know doing like we it's not true but it is true it's both hands you know on the one hand no we've had many very important sessions but on the other end there was a level at which we got that I thought man some things take time and um I'm sometimes I'm impatient and I sometimes forget it's like a painter you know till the end of your life the next painting will be something different than the one before it's like a session is needs to be something different than the one before you know there are times when I think what more can we talk about and then we just open and stumble on something that um so in that sense it's less about what I want to learn about the human condition as how deep can I go how deep can we go in a conversation in understanding the vast continent that is the human being and then there is the thing you said before which really is a question that fascinates me which is why this one yes and that one no I I I'm very intrigued by that you know um why is this one you know why this um what what and by the way that is a different definition of resilience the vast majority of people who could and then this is a question that you can ask yourself too you know that that really had conditions of life that could have left them in very dire circumstances and who actually turned it turned those things around and became driven and ambitious and creative and successful in the multitudes of ways that people can be successful and I think one of the things that I always ask and I think that that is a piece of resilience is was there a teacher a coach a neighbor a family member or friend that saw that thing that nobody else was seeing not because they didn't care about you but because they were too busy with their own craziness and they the person saw them and they could let that person help them Mentor them teach them connect them give them the first job you name him that piece seems to be a big big big difference between those who are living more richer lives maybe is the best way of saying it and those who just the struggle remained at the center of their life all the time that doesn't mean that the other ones don't struggle but they were able to put some of the pieces together and I find that an incredible thing that it it sometimes hinges really on it is about connection it is about relationship but it's not just a relationship with your parents or it's someone in your ecosphere you know that let that put that hand out and you took it it's not just because there are many times people put the hand out but the people don't take it or they take it and then they let it go and then they drown it they held it they held it when there was absolutely overtly no reason to want to hold on to it um I find that a very important moment in our life and many of us have had moments like this Esther I wantan to I want to thank you for um for sharing so much today and for all of your work it's it's it's touched the lives of many people myself included um and I hope that there are a number of people who maybe aren't familiar with you uh who have become more familiar with you now and maybe people who were familiar with you through one very narrow lens who can now appreciate sort of the breadth of your um both your interest and your expertise thank you thank you very much thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription now to that end membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally
