Paul Conti is an author & practicing psychiatrist who specializes in helping people heal from trauma. In this episode, Paul returns to The Drive to delve into the intricate relationship between emotional health, healthspan, & lifespan. He first challenges common assumptions about the inevitable decline of emotional health with age, providing strategies for conducting a comprehensive audit of internal emotional health. He establishes a framework for the foundation of good emotional health: a balance between the generative drive, the assertive drive, & the pleasure drive. Paul also explores the nuanced dynamics of motivation, happiness, & satisfaction as it relates to material possessions, draws connections between physical & emotional well-being, confronts the impact of negative self-talk, & describes how making peace with our mortality can foster a sense of hope, purpose & well-being. Additionally, Paul offers many practical insights into initiating emotional health improvements & navigating the search for a suitable therapist.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on emotional health and its impact on longevity, featuring a deep discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Paul Conti. They explored how emotional health differs from physical and cognitive health in that it can actually improve with age, unlike the other two domains which naturally decline. The conversation covered therapeutic relationships, self-talk, generative drive, and practical approaches to improving emotional well-being.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Emotional health often declines with age but doesn't have to, unlike physical and cognitive health [00:03:50]
- The concept of "generative drive" as distinct from assertion/aggression drive and pleasure drive [01:14:40]
- Discussion of how trauma and negative self-talk create neurological patterns that can be changed [01:16:57]
- The relationship between emotional health and inflammatory markers [01:29:05]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Practice self-awareness and introspection about internal dialogue [00:00:00]
- Create space between emotional triggers and responses [01:20:28]
- Focus on balancing generative, assertion, and pleasure drives [01:41:07]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Recording positive self-talk as an exercise to change negative internal dialogue [01:13:40]
- Using the "How's that working for you?" approach for self-evaluation [02:23:27]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"Perfect isn't just the enemy of good enough, perfect is really the enemy of everything that's not misery." [00:57:45]

"Change happens incredibly slowly and then very quickly." [02:06:59]

5. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can we develop better metrics for measuring emotional health?
2. What role does community play in emotional health optimization?
3. How can we better integrate emotional health screening into standard medical care?
4. What are the biological markers that correlate with improved emotional health?

The analysis continues with more sections, but I've focused on the most important aspects given space constraints. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular section?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] if an individual listening says hey how can I take this first diagnostic step and evaluate my own Drive what what would you say to them the first thing to do is to look inside oneself like how do I feel right this is where sometimes I I talk a lot about a life narrative and and a person can just start you can start writing you can start talking with someone you can start introspecting that there ways of taking stock of what is going on inside of me am I being kind to myself what's the voice inside of me saying to to me do I feel good about any of this right is any of this what I want hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:52] AA Paul so great to see you again it's never frequent enough I agree thank you yeah so um you know I don't know somehow the evolution of my thinking on longevity um I feel more and more drawn to health span over lifespan uh and again not that these are ever mutually exclusive they're not and virtually without exception anything that's enhancing Health span is enhancing lifespan I think it's just a question of focus and I think when you focus more of your energy on health span you're getting a lot of those life Lipan benefits for free and you can clearly do a lot of the one-off stuff that is purely lifespan related like managing your rap o and cancer screening and things like that but it's this focus on cognitive health and uh physical health that get you so much of that lifespan benefit and of course you're enjoying the quality of your life um those two def you know decline quite predictably and so really what we're trying to do as we age is delay the rate of decline but then there's this third component of Health span which is emotional health which is what obviously we're going to speak about in in great detail um and what I tell people and what I tell myself when I'm feeling a little depressed about aging is that the thing we have going for us is that's the one that doesn't have to get worse with age right everything else gets worse with age and you know again you can you can do quite bit to mitigate that and reduce the uh magnitude of the negative derivative but you're not making it a positive derivative but this doesn't have to be true for emotional health right um I want to ask you just to start in your experience working with people um is that what you see do you see that people generally become happier more um more satisfied as they age do you think that's the exception is the Rule and and and I guess as a followup to that how deliberate does one need to be about emotional health to ensure that you can reap what I just said which is hey you you could actually be on an increasing curve of emotional health as you age MH sure I think unfortunately emotional health often declines as people get older and that that is sort of the rule but but it doesn't have to be I think that that can be the exception and and that emotional health can improve throughout the lifespan but there's so many things that we have to be aware of as you said does it take intention like yes we have to really think about how are we taking care of ourselves how is my emotional health setting the climate for my physical health my cognitive

[00:03:50] Health uh for my happiness and very very often we kind of get swept up in this idea that oh time is passing and we're getting older isn't that bad and there's there's a whole set of societal standards that that that bias us away from good emotional health as we get older and I think this idea that it's so sad that we're getting older and we lament it and we talk about how fast time is going I think that's really a societal construct it's a social construct that we can change because if we're actively taking care of ourselves and this means yes it means of course taking care of our bodies so that we can remain active it it means remaining interested in new things it means learning it means keeping an expansive mindset that if we're doing this we're setting a climate inside of us that is conducive to all these other good things to health span lifespan cognitive Health but so often we're sort of trying to do that or we say that we're trying to do that but we're ignoring the climate that we're living in and we do have so much more control over that and I think that's part of the message of healthspan and lifespan is attend to our emotional health take it very seriously because we're living in it day in day out and we've got to step back from our lives often and look at what are we presuming right are we thinking oh it's just bad to get older and you know the jokes and all the you know the the S of dialogue within us is negative or can we feel good about getting older that that we have achievements under our belt and we have learning and wisdom that we didn't have before and we can continue to stay curious and active and get happier and healthier across the lifespan there's a demographic of people for whom that's absolutely true and it's wonderful to witness them they're very very different than people who are not like that where you see people aging and they're still they so sort of brigh eyed engaged in the world and that doesn't happen by accident so let's talk about kind of emotional health in the sense of um how it fits into Health span so when someone asks me to explain what what the cognitive component of Health span is we can talk about executive function we can talk about processing speed we can talk about recall memory and and of course you can drill down further and further and further into these things and you can start to paint a pretty comprehensive picture of what cognitive

[00:06:21] Health involves and you can also do that cognizant of the changes that occur so Arthur Brooks has written quite eloquently about the transition from fluid intelligence to crystallized intelligence and so well you know our fluid intelligence peaked when we met each other um and in that regard only become stupider we've gained other intelligence this crystallized intelligence that's more experiential and more about pattern recognition and while we might not have the processing speed we once did we're intelligent in a different way s similarly on the physical side we have really tangible and and I should say one other thing

[00:06:59] Paul we test these things these are all testable right these are quantifiable things and while most people don't necessarily do it it can be done we do it with our patients you go to the physical it's the same way I can I can spend the next five hours talking about the nuances of strength power explosiveness cardiorespiratory efficiency maximum cardi you know flexibility balance all of those things and yes we can measure all of those things effectively and we can track progress and things like that that I kind of have a definition for how

[00:07:33] I think of emotional health but I would much rather hear yours how would you explain the umbrella of a person's emotional health and then I'll plant the seed which is where I want to go with that is given that we don't have biomarkers for these things and necessarily tests that we can do I want to talk about how we can evaluate it sure sure well I think the way we evaluate is by looking inside so so then what are we looking for inside we're trying to understand what's going on in us you know when we wake up in the morning how do we feel about ourselves how do we feel about life are we lowgrade afraid right do we feel on the back foot you know there's so much of this going on in us and then that impacts our selft talk which is why we may not have biomarkers but we can look inside so to speak by asking the right questions like what do you say to yourself when you're alone right what kind of phrases or mantras seem to repeat over and over um do you criticize yourself do you have a shadow voice within you that is that is oppressive or that is regretful or that is ashamed right what is going on inside of us is often very opaque to us even though we're living through that when we then interface with the world so this idea that if we inquire if we become curious about ourselves we learn so much more about what is going on inside of us and it can guide us towards change so if a person wakes up and doesn't feel good about waking up or feels afraid or feels ashamed why is that right what can be done to change that because very often the environments inside of us we're not taking good care of so we we for example Harbor traumas within us that we haven't talked about or processed it's it's one example or we know that we don't feel great we don't know quite why and then we're sort of afraid and confused and we move forward this idea that we should be as interested at what is going on inside of our minds what is going on inside of us emotionally as we are about our bodies even though we have many more markers you know biomarkers internal and external to look at physically and sometimes what I'll see is is a person is paying a lot of attention to that but but it's all kind of couched in an emotional climate that is not good and that at times becomes angry and aggressive like I'm going to fight aging and you know I'm not going to let this get the the best of me and and like that's not a recipe for happiness and health there's so much acceptance called for so acceptance of the fact that we're aging so you're right when you and I met we had much greater processing power and like that's great we we could Sprint better say but life isn't a Sprint right it was it was fun to be able to Sprint when we could Sprint really really well but I I hope and believe that we're both smarter now even though if we stop and look at our processing power that we can see the change for the negative but that's one factor that's negative I mean overall I I think and hope that we're wiser and happier but we have such a bias in us a salience bias towards the negative so we look and say oh look I could do so much more before I could hold so much more in working memory I was so much faster look I'm getting old okay the trade-off for that of of increased intrinsic knowledge things we know without having to think about it that reside in our unconscious mind you know we we don't value that as much and

[00:11:12] I think if we can get over some of the biases that come from outside of us and then come inside of us both that our emotional health maybe isn't so important or or that there's something that's not so high yield paying attention to that or even that it's weak to pay attention to that instead of seeing that's underg guring everything else that we're doing on on top of it let's pay close attention to that and let's be interested and curious about ourselves because that's where really it leads us is to be curious at what is going on inside of me how is it affecting me how are all these things I do you know from morning till night affecting what's inside and how's what's inside affecting that or things I want to change or do differently now we become curious and engaged and we want to learn which is which is a characteristic of being younger and people want to learn and think expansively and you know are interested in new music and new sights and sounds and if we can maintain that that

[00:12:07] Curiosity about ourselves and about the world around us then we change this really really big factor that often is working against us and we're not aware of it by looking at it we can control it and make it work for us so where do some of these other things that you know that I think of at least um and and certainly others fit into the overall equation so I'll give you three things that are probably subsets of that and I kind of want to think about how you integrate them so so one would be something that's talked about a lot which is sense of purpose right and I think there's so much literature on this in as much as there's literature in this field which is obviously harder to you know do this type of work but you know you say to a person who's you know working hard but down and out hey look would your life be better if you won the

[00:12:58] Power Ball to and you never had to work again and the data are pretty clear that the answer is no right like if you didn't have something to do and it doesn't have to be the job but if you don't have something to do if you don't have a purpose it's very difficult to have an emotional Keel that's that's that's that's adequate um so sense of purpose would be something another thing um would be kind of this idea of satisfaction so kind of achievement following struggle um and again I think anybody listening to us right now can relate to that achievement with no struggle is not particularly satisfying um Arthur Brooks again has talked a lot about this idea that satisfaction is sadly fleeting but nevertheless um uh it provides you know temporarily it temporarily provides um a sense of uh a positive feeling that is you know worth reinforcing and then obviously what you're I think talking a lot about is relationships too so what what is the nature of our relationship to self and then the the the quality of our relationships with others what else would you add to this or would you subtract anything from it I think the first thing I would do is is take the extremely important things that you just said and and put them under the heading of a generative drive you know the the field of mental health has long understood that we have drives within us it has been focused on an assertion or an aggression Drive which makes sense like we have to do things right in order to survive in order to achieve in order to move ahead so there's an assertion

[00:14:40] Drive within us and there's also a pleasure this must be highly highly preserved I mean like natural selection must have been ruthlessly selecting for this MH the the thought would be and it would be very very hard to survive without either one of these you know especially in in an era of human development when one took a significant amount of responsibility for one's own

[00:15:06] Survival right that one had to be assertive you have to want to impose yourself on the world around you right so assertion or aggression whatever we want to call that drive it's it's a drive to do in the world and then there's a pleasure Drive which at times has been misunderstood that it's it's a drive for Hedonism but but pleasure comes in all sorts of ways pleasure comes from being inside out of the rain pleasure comes from being warm and not cold right pleasure comes from having enough to eat so so pleasure drives us not just through sex and and and satisfactions that that make it more attention but through through relief of pain through a sense of safety a sense of security so we're very very focused on humans in in the field of mental health which has guided much not all of course of our understanding and our beliefs about ourselves so we see assertion we see pleasure but that that ignores the humanity inside of us right if that were true how differently would we behave like people wouldn't create for the the satisfaction of creating something new right or go somewhere new because we don't know what is there right this is humans going deep in the ocean climbing mountains going to the

[00:16:19] Moon right there's something else going on in us and that other thing is the generative drive and aspects of philosophy and literature and religious study iies and psychological studies point us in this direction but the field of mental health doesn't acknowledge like we we want to live and create Beyond ourselves right we for example may have children not just so someone may take care of us later on and we perpetuate our genes but how about for the joy of seeing the the children learn and develop and be in the world and see them grow there are things inside of us that are about creation and are about growth and when we are in touch with that when there is an active generative drive then we are on this path to happiness the this is the way to take care of everything emotional health cognitive health physical health right it all comes together in some sense right it all naturally comes together if we're approaching life from a healthy place so to go back to your example of someone who is unhappy say working and feels like oh I'll happy if I win the lottery right why does the data show us that that's not true because the presumption there is the generative

[00:17:37] Drive isn't Satisfied by either scenario so if the person is working and they're not happy then they're not there's something there that could be would be probably should be different right are they enjoying the work that they're doing is this what's really inside of them what they value are they doing it just because they feel it pays them more money and they have to make more money do they feel feel that they need to make more money than they're making and now they're unhappy and disappointed and know there's something in their work that's not honoring this ultimately I believe greatest human thing to to make more than what we are so the contrast to that is not winning the Power Ball in fact it's it's the same thing in coming in a different disguise right it is now not honoring the generative Drive there's enough money but there's nothing coming out of the person that's creative if someone imagines earning the power winning the Power Ball and then maybe they'll go back to school and learn something they really wanted to learn or they'll go do this thing they really wanted to do or they'll grow a giant

[00:18:38] Garden right if if having the money that would come from the lottery win and having the time subserves the generative drive then that is a good thing but money alone doesn't provide that so that's where inquiry could come in like what is going on in this person's life how are they working um what choices are they making and why what's inside of them do they do they feel good about what they're doing do they want to do something else we see examples of this so so often where people are out of accord with themselves and they're unhappy and then there's a sense of futility about it I'll get out of this if I win the lottery and that's not the answer there are many many things we can change in our lives and me you and I know this how many different things have we each done across the lifespan some of which we then incorporate going forward and some of which each of us has decided to move away from and I think some of that is honoring the generative Drive of if I'm not feeling a certain way when

[00:19:35] I'm getting up in the morning like what is it that I need to do differently to feel that way Paul do you believe I know this is not knowable but what is your belief around the innate nature of the strength of the generative drive in an individual so if you look at a thousand children that are born across various cultures socioeconomic status different races all any look at all factors and what what is your view on the innate strength of that drive do you believe it's relatively preserved and that early life experiences shape it in as adults well I think there's nature and nture aspects that it it's wide ranging across humans but if we really step back within a relatively narrow band but but if we when we come in close we see that the drive VAR so much across people um but how we see that is also a factor of what the person has been through right has a person been taught and told that their generative Drive was worth something did their parents Delight in things that were of interest to them right did they feel nurtured or did they feel denigrated did they feel uh thought of as less than by the society around them for whatever reasons people do whether whether it's race religion gender identity sexual orientation there are things that that make people push towards people feeling less than or feeling less capable that the good things in the world aren't out there for them so one aspect is genetic that we probably inherit a whole set of factors that we don't understand that lead with a predisposition someone may be relatively satisfied um with a level of life that might make someone else bored and needing something very very different then our life experience probably through psychological factors epigenetic factors even factors of inflammation running around in Us and how that makes us feel physically based upon what's going on in US emotionally now we have a whole bunch of factors that feed back to the Natural genetics and impact where am I at any point in time which is why we can intervene and we can help people to feel more of a generative drive if a person feels disillusioned and disheartened right that maybe there's some desire in me to do something different or better but it but why it's not going to happen anyway or I I'll end up feeling disappointed and worse afterwards can we help people can we help people be in the world in a way that better honors what's inside of them and tells them they can understand and harness and and change their lives in ways that bring them greater happiness so I think we all have a generative drive it varies a lot among humans but if we really step back and we look we're probably selected to be within a relatively narrow range although as we get closer that range seems wider and wider and what we can do is help ourselves to optimize whatever the range of genetic Drive is within us because it's not set at a certain place and through things like giving people opportunity or encouragement when there was none before helping people with their mental health or their physical health helping people with basic needs basic needs of encouragement that often doesn't happen in for example our educ ation systems and we can help people be at the best place they can be and I think that's the leader of all else if we help the generative Drive be as best it can be where we want to be in the world and we want to see and understand and create whatever that may be whether it's a garden or it's a company or it's a cure for cancer right if we help ourselves to live as best we can then the rest of the aspects of our health will follow you know I know anyone with a a a a really strong generative Drive who's engaged in the world who isn't also interested in taking care of themselves right this this comes along with feeling that we can be the best we can be in the world around us I want to ask a question but what you said I'm want to come back to because uh actually

[00:23:46] I'll start with my my question on that so maybe I'm not understanding it correctly but sometimes when I think of a strong generative Drive I think of you know a person who is striving so much who is is so productive in the eyes of the world right they're you know running three companies they're you know

[00:24:06] Successful by every metric you would have but they're actually not taking care of themselves right they're working so hard that they're not taking care of themselves that that seems a little bit at odds with what you just said or have I misunderstood generative drive and I'm now talking about a pathologic state or a state that is harmful yeah achievement is not the measure of the generative

[00:24:28] Drive so there are people who are phenomenally successful in the eyes of the outside world in running three companies and they feel great about what they're doing they have great relationships with people around them they're thinking as they're doing they're taking pride in moving forward uh businesses or ideas in ways that wouldn't be happening without them and there's an engagement in life and they feel productive right they feel worthwhile they wake up with a good feeling right but there are people who look the same from the outside and are driven by shame or fear or previous deprivation that they're can never be enough to to so that what you have can't be taken away from you right there are people who are laboring under those fears often from Early Childhood experiences and from the outside they look very very uh productive and and successful but on the inside that things are very threadbear or they're filled with fear right whereas you can see a person who from the the outside world is you know not doing very much or coming and going from a routine job but they're growing a beautiful garden in their backyard and they are filled with the generative drive and they are happy so what we see from the outside tells us something but it's just data it's like any other data data outside of context is is not of value and in fact becomes misleading and I and I see this at times in people who are very successful who don't understand why they are not happy because they are very successful so it should back map that they must be successful but what really is going on they may have a very strong assertion or aggression drive because they're running away from something their own fears about themselves or shame or prior poverty or whatever it may be that drive is very very strong their enjoyment their ability to take pleasure in all of it is very very low and then the generative drive inside of them is at a much lower level than it seems to be from the outside that's very helpful and it actually I think probably answers part of my next question which is would it be your belief again knowing that this is not knowable that everyone is at least from a nature perspective born with the capacity for enough generative drive to be happy later in life I think the answer to that is yes I

[00:26:53] I think as you commented a little while ago we're selected for that because that is adaptive high levels of generative drive this is the person who in hunter gatherer days would say the food is a little bit sparse you know there's a mountain over there like we don't know what's on the other side of it maybe we should check right or maybe we should do things differently so that we're we're better prepared for what may come next the generative drive and the enthusiasm and the Joy inside people when when that is being realized does pull Humanity forward I think it was I think Leon trosky said that the the locomotive of history is war and I would beg to differ with trosky I I think war and um the aggression driven by human envy and destructive capacity is is the opposite it's not the locomotive of

[00:27:51] History it pushes history backwards and what is actually the locomotive of history is the generative Drive within us as human beings in our ability to realize it this is why people learn and create and imagine like menal of in front of the periodic table and the joy of like putting wait a second I see a pattern here and like figuring it all out like there there is a joy in creation whether it's watching a child or it can be watching something grow or discovering something this is the locomotive of history but we pay so little attention to it inside of us even even the idea of valuing ourselves by what we see from the outside by things that that we feel bring us Prestige and we know that that doesn't make happiness so we've we've kind of gotten lost a little bit and a little bit away from what our our core humanity is telling us is we want to feel worthwhile and we we we want to be interested in things around us and we want to be sort of delighted by new knowledge and new experience and when people carry this through the lifespan going back to where we started these are people who are happy and who are taking care of themselves and who age well and who don't fear death right that's also another part of it is when when people are very are are living through the generative Drive they're taking care of themselves in mind and body and emotion the I I don't find they're afraid of death mean it's not that people want to die but they want to stay alive because they're healthy and happy but there's a difference between that kind of enthusiasm and fear and I think that is remarkable we should look very closely at who are people who are not fearing death and and we see that they are often in very good balance the generative

[00:29:29] Drive is being honored and the assertion within them and the ability to feel pleasure and satisfaction these are all well balanced and then they're in places where they can find some peacefulness and some reflective capacity and some ability to feel contentment and Delight in the world around them I mean we see this and these are happy people and we know that is not tied to the things we might think it's it's tied to like wealth for example so so how can a person begin that examination because I think what you said is is very insightful which is from the outside these can be indistinguishable right you you can you can have it you know an individual who looks like they are doing remarkably well um Again by any metric I don't just mean financially but I mean in terms of actual achievement but it could be fueled by fear by anger by insecurity by any of these other things and you can have an individual who's achieving the same things or frankly less um but it's coming from this generative place so if an individual listening says hey how can

[00:30:44] I take this first diagnostic step and evaluate my own Drive what what would you say to them the first thing to do is to look inside oneself like how do I I feel right this is where sometimes I I talk a lot about a life narrative and and a person can just you can start writing you can start talking with someone you can start introspecting that there ways of taking stock of what is going on inside of me am I being kind to myself what's the voice inside of me saying to to me do I feel good about any of this right is any of this what I want but but let's stop there for a second

[00:31:24] Paul because that's not an easy question to necessarily answer answer I mean I think I want to dig into this because it it can be very difficult to answer that at a deep level CU sometimes The Superficial answer is so obvious right if you have everything if you have material success your knee-jerk answer would be of course this is what I want so how do you how do you go deeper into that question to to what you're talking about which is the look inside then you use more specific tools so what do you say to yourself when you're alone is there something that you say to yourself over and over if you make a mistake what do you say to yourself then is there an urge in you to be helpful to other people when you see them around you right if someone stumbles in front of you do do do you feel like you want to move forward to to help that person right the these are the ways in these are the the ways to give us answers about how we feel about ourselves and you know there was a period of time uh seven eight years ago where I would for some period a week or so would see people who had very very high levels of success that from the outside looked as if they they must be happy right look at all of this right and when I would stop doing that I came back and I would do clinical work on a unit that takes care of people who don't have insurance uh many of whom are Indigent not all uh who have drug and alcohol problems so the opposite end of the socioeconomic spectrum and I I swear to you that this is true I could find no difference in overall happiness between the two groups so someone who looked to have it all would feel if I don't have that next achievement it all goes away right so the person isn't isn't owning what they have earned for themselves and this is a theme inside of me so the person may have made a lot of money know they don't have to worry about being in need or they may have achieved at their chosen art form but they're so afraid that if the next thing doesn't go right it'll all be taken away or they'll feel ashamed of themselves this goes on a lot in people who are high achieving it's like what have I done for myself lately right and if I haven't done something good enough I can't feel good enough about myself there is so much of that whereas I could see people who from the outside literally had nothing who would be saying you know when I get out of here I'm going to do it differently right I'm going to do it better I'm I'm going to go see this person I really miss who is helpful to me I'm going to get a job I'm going to keep myself away from what what got me in here in the first place and they might have a an enjoyable story or memory to to say I remember one point meeting someone who is living behind a bush under bad conditions who is far far happier than the vast majority of people I had seen over the previous several days and the the truth is we are often often running from something or trying to achieve something that makes us safe in the world and all of a sudden we're going to feel better about ourselves and what we really need to do is honor that we are human and what is going on inside of us is so important and if we are willing to look at that we're willing to ask the questions what do I say to myself how do

[00:34:46] I feel about myself versus other people right do I feel like a fraud am I afraid everything will be taken away from me every time I drop something do I say what an idiot you know inside of myself like what is going on inside of do I feel like I have an openness of spirit to new things or people who are different from me like we can ask ourselves these questions but we have to stop feeling that what we Adorn ourselves with is what brings us happiness then we can get to this this owning what is ours so that person who is going to try and put a roof over their head when they leave right can own what's theirs which is the tenacity to have what survived behind the bush right survived and lived in that way and maintained a good spirit and often these are people who are helpful to other people and have and are looking out for people around them like that is something to feel so good about as you strive for what comes next right just as someone who has worked and learned and studyed you know could feel good about the achievements they have or someone who goes to a difficult job that doesn't provide them with satisfaction that they feel as backbreaking labor and underpaid but they go and do that and they take home a salary that supports a family and puts a roof over people's heads feel proud of that right when we don't feel good about ourselves often we are out of kilter with the generative Drive within us that is absolutely a part of what makes people unhappy but also coming along with that is not owning what is ours and how many people who've raised families right done things that are so impressive from the outside have told me over the years that oh they're not worth anything they didn't make enough money they didn't do this they didn't that and it's not what matters right it is not what matters within us it is being the best that we can be and honoring the drive inside of us to live and to create how would you make the case to somebody who's listening to this and says Paul I get what you're saying but there's no way that if I had to choose between those two extremes meaning I live behind a bush but you know I have some sort of happiness but I have nothing no material possessions no status in society versus

[00:37:03] I could be incredibly successful in the eyes of society and with it have all of the Comforts that come from that success all of the wealth but you're you you'll tell me that I'm unhappy um someone listening to us might not be able to even wrap their head around what you're saying and they would and because they might be right somewhere in the middle right they're clear they're not they're not they're not living on the street um but they're struggling right and they're and they believe that their struggle is because they don't have something greater or even they acknowledge it and say yeah but if I had to choose between those two I'd rather have all the comfort of the world um materially and be miserable like what I mean it's a silly question but how would you make the case to them that a it's not a zero sum game and that's actually that's that's a false choice so we'll come back to that but more importantly even in exe why is that the wise choice well I would say get to know people in both categories better right if you're if you're in the middle because I know what

[00:38:07] I would choose I mean I would absolutely choose that person who doesn't have any material possessions if I were making the choice for myself like the selfish choice is to choose that person I don't I don't want to be the other person right because I know that's not happy I I see where that goes right I I I see where the dissatisfaction leads and I don't want that right I would much rather have within me the the the spirit right that that makes me feel like I can do something I can make some change because we all need the basic the basic minimum in order to have some safety and satisfact like a roof over our head enough to eat right but often times if you give a person a little bit of help they can go off and do that right if I were that person getting some help so that maybe now I can move my my life forward I would feel an enthusiasm about that I can make things better I can have the minimum that I need and from there what is it that I choose to build when we look at measures of satisfaction you know societies even today who are by and large hunter gatherer Societies or the societies that we from the outside think have nothing are often happier than we are so like there's your proof right there is your proof so so I think as a society we we have so much plenty that we can look after people better you know

[00:39:30] I always say we live in a society that runs ahead so quickly that we're always trampling people along the way right and one it's just not right to do and two any of us can be in that group of people who has something really difficult happened to them was up against something really really big and then something else really really big and and gets to a place where like we need a helping hand up and and any of us could be that person or someone we love could be that person and even if that weren't the case it's just not right and even if that weren't the case it's not even economically efficient right like help people to be productive members of society right that's important economically and of course Beyond economics is the human part that matters but even just the dollars and cents of it tells us help people up when they need help we can do more for people to give them an opportunity to make a life for themselves that can feel productive and contain happiness within it and if we do this for all of us we give all of us an opportunity to have the generative Drive within us realized as that may be for us someone who's you know very interested in um academic learning and success you know may u may think look I I like that

[00:40:53] I like when I get an Accolade I like when I learn something and then maybe they go off and they start building businesses and they feel great about that like that's wonderful that is wonderful if that's what that person feels good about there are also people who live good productive lives and they're good neighbors to the people around them and they take care of of children if they've chosen to be responsible for children this is these aren't people who should feel any less good about themselves right and the irony in the world is that often what I see are both groups of people are not feeling good about themselves they're not earning what is there as the person who went off and studied and created and can't feel good about the wealth they generated that now may be good for people around them and but they don't feel good about that or the people who who struggled and worked and and made good lives for themselves don't feel that they have enough and I I see this as coming along with this idea about aging that oh we should feel so bad about getting old and and oh we should feel so bad about whatever we can identify in ourselves that isn't what we think it should be if we look from the outside and there is a real simplicity and just sitting with ourselves and introspecting or sitting with someone that we're talking to or writing with a pen or being in a therapy room of look let me think about me because the truth is all of us are so different that as to be really and truly unique so if we take ourselves out of how we try and tether ourselves to all the shs around us and say let's talk about your life and let's talk about what your experience of life has been your experience of being in the world and and trying to to have some healthy control over a world that's difficult to control let's let's talk about that and it's those discussions that lead people to interesting decisions sometimes their decisions to leave a very high paying job for a lower paying job but then the depression goes away or the substance use goes away sometimes it's a decision to strive for more that leads a person ultimately to achieve external measures of success but we don't know what that is we don't know what that is but if we start thinking about it and talking about it we also go back to the basics of how are you taking care of your body it's going to feel it's going to be very difficult to feel good if one is not taking care of the basics of their physical function we get down to the first principles physical health the things that contribute to lifespan

[00:43:16] Health span right cognitive health and emotional health but we have to go back to the first principles of like who are you and let's talk about your story right because that understanding is what leads to the next decisions and the next decisions are not obvious from where we stand now Paul do you believe it's um or or H H how how positive in in terms of its predictive value would the following be and again I'm still thinking through this uh as as almost a self- audit tool but if if a person ostensibly recognizes that they are not taking care of their physical health okay they're drinking too much smoking using substances in an unhealthy way uh eating too much you know what pick not exercising all of these things if a person can can recognize objectively that those things are true and that's a that's a generally pretty easy thing to recognize what is the what is the ppv the positive predictive value of that sign that says there is something unhealthy going on in me emotionally so this of recognizing the sign if if those signs are present the the sort of physical you know not doing the things to you know make yourself the best version of yourself physically if give it let's assume that that's easy to recognize How likely is it to then be predictive of the fact that you're emotionally unhealthy oh very very high very very high predictive value because because think about what's the link between the two like it doesn't doesn't feel good to get up every day and not feel good right it doesn't feel good to know that one is unhealthy and energy levels are low it doesn't feel good to look at oneself in the mirror and say I could would should be healthy right or to not be able to keep up with one's kids or whatever it is that goes on inside of us that makes us know that if that's going on something isn't aligned well within us right like what is the reason for that or I have to work to do this this and this so I don't have time to take care of myself or I've got to be in this job I hate or I'm so stressed that I can't like we have all these reasons but but there aren't good reasons right I mean like this is what we have our bodies and our minds are what we have so the idea that we can just push that aside and not pay attention to it like can't be right right it cannot be right to not pay enough care and attention to everything that we have as we move forward so the the key is the Curiosity to link the two right so there's a high positive predictive value that there's something emotionally then out of balance if we want to look at it that way or something in the mental health realm whatever it may be but whether or not good comes of that is the link of curiosity I mean that it's amazing Paul because it's that's such a common phenotype among for all of us like I don't I include myself in this category there are absolutely things that I do you for me it's clearly overindulging in food often right even when I'm saying to myself Peter you don't need to be eating this extra helping of dessert or whatever um how do I think about that in a way to not overanalyze this or over interpret it right I mean how do you how do you decide if you know my my oving is actually a canary in the coal mine that says hey there's something going on inside of you emotionally and and and my wife and I will talk about this all the time she'll be like you are really emotionally eating right now and I think we talk about that a lot I think we understand sort of what that means she's like you're so stressed out get out of the freaking Pantry like you want you've been walking back in here every 20 minutes and your elbow deep in the

[00:47:08] Pringles what's going on um it is there pathology there is that is is that sometimes an okay coping strategy like I I want to be careful not to kind of demonize everything but at the same time I want to be able to use this as signs because again I'm coming back to this idea of man when it comes to this domain of Health we don't have biomarkers we don't have scans that give us answers blood tests tests that you can do with objective measurements so

[00:47:40] I'm searching for other ways to to gain an insight into how do I at least uh start asking questions to get myself help well in the scenario you gave where it's a subject of conversation like hey you're doing that you're you're stress you're emotionally eating and we kind of know there's something there right but a lot of times a place to start is are we over managing ourselves you know because every now and then like a little bit of indulgence is okay right so so let's make sure that we're not that it's not that that we're criticizing right that we're actually recognizing something that we don't need a biomarker for right like look when I am very stressed I am eating in ways I don't want to be and it soothes me a little bit at the moment and then I feel worse about it and I got to go do something to make up for it like that's not good right like that that's that is face validity right like that's just very clearly not good so then what we can do and often do is just simply perpetuate that to recognize that and it goes no further right and then we continue to do it as opposed to saying whoa this is the place for curiosity right of like that's interesting right what is different about the feeling inside of you if you eat because you're hungry or you eat because you're stressed can you recognize that difference maybe you can if you're paying attention to it a lot of people can and if not what's the context around like you you can have an idea of what's going on inside of you and then it fits into this kind of human thing that we do which is short-term gratification right at the expense of something that in the long term is negative right this is why when we were back in medical school know people were not very interested in studying addiction right and the thought was that addiction was separate from other mental health things and it was you know people who were doing something they shouldn't and then weren't able to stop and it was it was a very kind of I thought denigrating and disinterested um approach it is so different now because what I think the field has come to recognize is that these mechanisms there is going on in all of us all the time right the short-term soothing of a little bit of food that isn't healthy for you at the expense of you feeling badly about yourself in the longer term is is part of that same cycle it's the same brain

[00:50:12] Machinery that is that is getting harnessed so that we over prioritize the short term right at the expense of the long term while looking away from the fact that we are doing that and if we become curious why is it what what is what crests inside of you that you a person who's very good at looking at the longterm and foregoing immediate gratification and all of that we say I want to sue this right now with food right I mean if we look at that the thought would be we've got to be able to do something about that right like you've done much harder things right than to realize oh there's an emotion inside of me like wait let me go look at what is that what is that emotion where is it coming from and maybe you can't stop the emotion in the moment but it might tell you hey this thing in my life should be a little a little bit different right or it might say I Crest like this with relative frequency is this okay can I take care of myself because sometimes it's harder answers too that the answer might be well a person should do less like you know the answer isn't keep doing everything that you're doing and like don't have these emotions that Crest in certain ways you know the answer might be why are you doing all the things that you're doing and again I'm not saying this is the case for for you but we but we need to all look at this like what is going on inside of me that something is cresting and all of a sudden I prioritize the short term and I don't look at that and and this can be the beginning of this be the beginning of you know 30 sessions of weekly therapy of with a person of talking about this Paradigm within us of how are we doing this for all sorts of things in life what might be be rationalizing about our choices personal and professional how are we taking care of ourselves what's the climate inside of us because when a person seems to be taking care of themselves from the outside and maybe is right you can see from the outside but they're so frustrated on the inside or they're so afraid or they're so overly managing themselves to make up for something then you we don't necessarily see that that keeps them healthy right there may be a higher inflammatory state that increases risk of cardiovascular disease for example or of autoimmune phenomena like we know this happens so we have to be curious about ourselves and it is amazing what we hide from ourselves you we we we go through life hiding so much of what is going on inside of us from our eles in the service of maintaining some direction we've decided was important right I've got to go do that

[00:52:33] I've got to go achieve that and then we put these blinders on ourselves and we don't look is does this make sense for me am I being the best person that I can be what's the whole set of priorities in my life personal and professional self-care about other people that you care about about achievement am I balancing all of this right and it's remarkable how little we inquire of ourselves about our own unhappiness or markers of our own unhappiness even like excessive emotional eating it might may not be the determinant of absolute misery for a person but like there's something going on there that's not happy that's not in alignment with oneself I think there you know this there's this Continuum from what we just talked about which is people that are even out from the outside it's obvious that they're not taking care of themselves and again the patterns here are many it could be just a straight up across the board I don't sleep well I don't exercise I don't eat well I drink to excess and you know in those situations I guess it's it becomes pretty obvious to someone on the outside right hey there's there's something going on here that you you're you're you're you're acting in a manner that is harmful to yourself right um we should explore why um then you have kind of the intermittent example I talk about you know using myself as an example of hey you're you know for the most part you're taking reasonable care of yourself but then you really have these these breakout moments where you're soothing something some stress with with a maladaptive Behavior right and then of course you have probably where I think I used to live and I think there are a lot of people though not nearly as many who also live here which is the over management which is you're you're going to be perfect you're going to be by any objective measure you're going to have it perfectly dialed in with respect to your health right you're going to eat like a robot exercise like a robot sleep like a robot Etc that's probably a harder one to get people to look inside and see isn't it and and if you were if you were talking to somebody like that and you know again somebody watching us who might be that person how would you help them come to realize that while on the surface that looks really good and it looks like they're doing everything so well that they they clearly must be doing this from a place of Health um how would you at least challenge the thinking on that yeah one route of approach is so the the old sort of Freudian way of seeing this which is no less valid just because it's it's old and and the old freudians didn't get everything right but boy they they really got some things right and they thought of this as what they thought of as living in the ego it wasn't the modern idea of ego it's like that's a person at their best right at their most self-aware and it's not easy to live in the ego right like we have to think about ourselves in order to be self-aware right in order to be aware that we're not aware of everything right so it's this idea that as best I can like I understand myself and what's going on inside of me and what my hopes and fears are and what I want and what I have achieved and what I'm afraid of it's it's all it's all within us and the ideas is from there then we can healthily control our lives but we're keeping two other aspects of ourselves in balance and what they thought of as the ID was the desire for immediate gratification I feel bad now where's the food right there's that part of us right

[00:56:07] I want what I want and I want it now right there's that part of us on one side and the other side is what they call the super ego the part that manages us that says hey you want what you want when you want now but like that's not okay keep yourself in check right and and there these parts of us that manage us and that want Indulgence and that it's us the whole Us in the middle that has to recognize all that and keep it all in balance and what we see is that part they called the super ego the self-management often gets very in the circumstances you're talking about gains uh Supremacy over the others and that's not good that's how we internalize the persecutor right where there have been times it's it's a parallel to this but this is a true story where someone who I haven't seen before who is in my office and I'm getting to know them and they're telling me about being really persecuted by someone who says you can't do anything and you're not worth anything and they're describing and talking about all of this and I'm thinking okay okay let's think about where is this person living how can we get them out of there and then I learn oh that that that other person has been dead for seven years but the person took into themselves the persecutor that you're not good enough now that can come from outside of us and that's very striking when it comes to outside of us and and it does often it's not striking and rare it's striking and relatively frequent it can also come inside of us now there's probably some external modeling but it can come inside of us where I decide the way I'm going to be good enough is I'm going to berate myself and torment myself until I'm perfect and you know

[00:57:45] Perfect Isn't just the enemy of good enough perfect is really the enemy of everything that's not misery right because no one is perfect nothing is perfect and when we're over managing ourselves that's what we're telling ourselves right this super ego part of us if we want to call it that is always looking at us what are you doing wrong what's not right what's not good enough and and and that becomes a very harsh critical voice and often we don't know that that's inside of us I tell the story at times of a person who is who is very underachieving given this person's level of intelligence and and you know other things that they had done and they were so below in role performance what one might have expected and I couldn't understand you I'm as started asking questions and I'm trying to understand and then I realized at one point I this person loved music right so what what music are you listening to I i' learned the person was taking these long drives to go to some awful job that they didn't have to have and they weren't listening to music in the car they were or were not were not listening to me so now we have a clue why is that this person loves music is a music of ficado why because without the music the person could uninhibited on all that long drive to the job and all the drive back tell them what garbage they were what a loser they were this was going on the whole time in fact the person was going to a farther away job than they could have gone to to have more time to criticize and berate themselves and it's an extreme circumstance but but it's not that uncommon that we see things like this and that person needed to stop that in order to increase role performance Which is vastly higher than it was before it's remarkably different than it was before but the search for perfectionism through self-criticism because when you explore that the person wasn't aware that they were being sadistic to themselves no one says that when you say what's really going on there that actually I'm being sadistic to myself this is what I need to do this is this is how I keep myself moving forward this is how my I get myself going to any job right no it's not no this is how you're keeping yourself down but those voices inside of us are very powerful and yes I've given a couple really strong examples but they're not outlying examples where oh they're so different from what goes on in us I think they're examples to elucidate what very often is going on inside of us where we are trying to manage ourselves whether we're being perfectionist about it or we are afraid or we are ashamed in ways that are very very harmful to us cuz I think that kind of selft talk destroys motivation destroys confidence increases levels of inflammatory markers right increases risk of illness like there's so much bad that comes of us comes of that but that's inside of a lot of us that is inside if a person stop this person aware of it yeah say stop and think like is that inside of you it's remarkable how many people stop and think and yeah I'm in the shower in the morning telling myself of all the things you better not mess up today or what did you do wrong yesterday or you know there's so much did you have to Prime this particular individual to get them to recognize consciously what they were doing oh sure because we been we had been talking for a while right so clearly the person wasn't aware of it right we had to through a process of inquiry we had to stumble across something that didn't make sense right so when I learned this person loves music I just got that in my head right this what this person does they listen to music when they're home and and and they have this really long drive and then I learned they're not listening to music and then it just makes me then I become curious about that now maybe there was another reason they like looking out the window I don't know but it's like wait wait let's inquire there so then when I point that out you're taking a longer drive and not doing something you enjoy in order to punish yourself well now we have curiosity about that how can you not be curious about that if someone you've gone to for help you know is is kind of drawing your attention to that and that's often how we start changing things even Within

[01:02:00] Myself and in my own therapy of realizing there was such a a negative critical voice like all the time and it wasn't needed to help me you know move forward with life at some point in time trying to control things around me and feeling afraid of not being successful or not being good enough you know leads me to start managing myself pretty closely but then I stopped managing myself where like when I was in high school I could you know do three Sports over the course of the year and still maintain academics like that was good to learn how to do that and balance fun and work but then it gets to be too much of a good thing and now I'm going to manage myself by being so critical and telling myself all the things that could go wrong and knowing how I'll feel and making damn sure that nothing is any less than perfect which of course it is and now I feel worse about myself and you know that in me like in many people was why I could look successful from the outside but for a long long time was you know really not not happy and depressed and ashamed of things and you know feeling in ways I had to then through my own work get out of me and it's it's it's experiences like this had helped me you know have insights I think you don't one doesn't need to go through something to know that others are but having been through a lot of that you know I've learned what you see on the outside doesn't tell you at all what's going on on the inside like seeing a beautiful home doesn't tell you what's going on on the inside of it who are the people how are they behaving are they healthy you know it's not that it's a irrelevant that that there's a beautiful home on the outside but it's also not irrelevant if let's say there is a home that doesn't look so good on the outside there could be so much Beauty inside of it and so much Happyness inside of it and we know those things are true right

[01:03:41] I mean you and I both been around life enough to know that those things are true so let's bring that to the Forefront if we know those things are true let's look inside of us with the same curiosity and not having to hide from ourselves what we might what we might find there you know I wrote a little bit about this in the book about the discovery of the inner voice and you know in my case it was so startling um I say startling not because I had an inner monologue which I suppose many of us do but in terms of how aggressive and you know the Bobby

[01:04:14] Knight voice um but it was remarkable to me that it it it like I just had a breakthrough one day at PCS where all of that came out that that's what was actually happening and it's it's a little sad to me to realize that you know whatever 47 years of my life went by probably 45 of them with that voice and yet no recognition of it and why that is frightening to me is it tells me there have to be a lot of other people out there with abolutely potentially as awful a voice in their head they might be listening to us now thinking yeah that would be awful and yet they have it and they don't recognize it right if your experience of it normalizes it and also if you have an emotional investment on some level that this voice is causing you to behave and achieve in ways that let you feel good enough about yourself and even then you don't feel good enough about yourself so you're really afraid of feeling feeling worse right then it gains almost a buy right like a bu we don't go and look at that it just gets a pass and that happens that happens all the time it's so automatic within us just as there are people who say around 20 years of age can can have schizophrenia that they didn't have before and they're hearing voices inside of them and it's only till years later that they realize that's not normal right because they had an experience of of now hearing voices inside of them and and they don't know that that's not normal like even something that's so out what we would think of that's so different than what most people are experiencing but it's it's not different from what you're experiencing if you're experiencing it and it's come about in a way that didn't have a marker that that told us that it was not healthy so so again we you know there's a common theme to what we're talking about which is introspection curiosity of like wow there could be things going on inside of me that are wildly unhelpful to the things I'm trying to achieve like being like better health span and lifespan or better emotional health they're wildly counterproductive and they're just going on on the surface like hiding right there they are waving a flag and I'm not paying any attention to it so it is curiosity about ourselves like how do I work what is going on inside of me that makes all the difference and when we when we start thinking about that we become aware of it that's when we can change because you you described like kind of feeling all this all at once right but that's how change happens in people now I I think the same principles yeah there's a great Hemingway quote right which I'm paraphrasing incorrectly which was change happens incredibly slowly and then very quickly right right and and if you think about quantal leaps or you know you and I both like mathematics people like you know asymptotic functions right like there what we're getting at is is discontinuity right that that even I think this is true on all levels you know down from from like quantum physics so through to astrophysics where you know you see that we we are only here because we are in these these Eddy pools of counter entropy where instead of everything dividing and dispersing like it does in the vast majority of the universe there are these places where oh certain forces you go the other way now there's there's not things coming apart but coming together and so whether we're looking at the biggest levels or we're looking at the smallest levels the way that things work inside of us is that there are processes of of understanding and change that are rare or in in frequent but that we can um we can bring to the surface by looking in the right place if you look all over the universe most of what you see is no life but if you look in the right places where those forces of coming together are more than than coming apart then you see oh there's something that's happening there the same way inside of us if we're looking where things are happening then we can gain understandings that happened very very quickly just as in mathematical functions or quantal leaps these things are dis discontinuous so when you develop I think this would be my my thought about that when you have a curiosity about yourself that leads you to now do something where you're thinking about yourself right and you're thinking about yourself with the help of other people outside of you right and you've engendered this across time and now you go do something that's intensive then all of a sudden something becomes clear to you and you see oh I'm now I'm now interested in this and now you start to be you start to do all the things that you do when you're interested in things like H why is this here how is did this develop how is this serving me how might this be working against me right and and now you can change right now you can change that when before you couldn't change it now yes change happens slowly right it's slow slow slow slow but then it happens fast so you do a lot of work on yourself to get to that point where the change can happen which I think is is true again these These are human and maybe the these are principles of existence right same with physical health this person works out and works out and you don't immediately notice linear change yeah so you have to have you have to have faith that that the work you're doing is going to get you there and lo and behold it does and that's how these really big things inside of us what am I saying to myself is there a running narrative inside of myself is someone else's voice inside of me these happen to us and it's amazing that we often just don't know it then isn't it more likely that we're going to choose the short-term soothing you know in the light of that then of course like just get some soothing on board whether it's Pringles or it's a drug or it's or it's whatever it may be right we're more likely to choose short-term soothing because we're afraid and we're out of control and we're berating ourselves like whoa whoa let's just bring some peace and understanding to this equation and then things will change for the better even if you have to change things for for the better make change yeah tell I'll tell you a funny story that happened today and it's it's um these things occur on a daily basis so I get a daily reminder of this um and it amazes me so I was uh shaving today and then I went to grab a brand new bottle of aftershave so this Nivea big glass bottle of After Shave same thing

[01:10:48] I've been using for 25 years and this is the first time this has ever happened Paul I went to grabbed the bottle and I opened it and as I was uh dumping it in my hand maybe because it's so cold today uh it was harder to get out and sort of uh somehow the bottle dropped and it landed on the floor and it's a glass bottle and it shattered so now you've got glass and aftershave on the floor and in moments like that I'm always now paying attention to what like what's cuz there's no one around for me to talk to

[01:11:23] I'm not going to like yell out loud or anything and the only thought I had was oh let's make sure you don't step on the glass looks like there's no glass over there so let's just walk over there do you have another bottle cuz you're not going to want to reach down on the floor and mop some of that up because there's probably glass in it okay found another bottle away we go um and I remember thinking at you know about a minute later wow what a different conversation that would have been 5 years ago right I mean that would have been a three minute internal lashing of you incompetent non-attentive piece of what how could you possibly drop that you know you know and so but again it's the thing that I gravitate towards is the the the ability to start paying attention to just listen to that voice it's and again I've talked a lot about the exercise that I used to do that which was suggested by Katie um and and by another therapist at PCS which was the recording right so for anyone who has not heard that I think it is worth even if one person listening to this has not heard this story I think it's worth repeating which is um um I was I was instructed as I was leaving PCS to um take my phone out every time there was every time I made a mistake um or fell short by by whatever metric and to um speak to speak out loud audibly and record the way I would uh speak to my best friend if he had made the same mistake right so if my best friend had just dropped the aftershave I wouldn't yell at him and call him a piece of I would you know say are you you okay make let's make sure you don't you know those are really small pieces of glass there let's not step on them um and while that now is a very easy thing to do it took months of recording those and you you know I still have a number of these recordings

[01:13:40] Believe It or Not which I would then forward to Katie each time um but it's it's it's amusing to note how strained they were at the beginning as I had to learn a new language right you know like the the well you know I hope you're okay it's okay you know it's just and now of course it's very natural so again I I highlight that to say that was a technique that worked for me incredibly powerful yeah but most of all I think the moral of that story is malleable like right you you know if when this exercise was suggested to me I did it because I was at rock bottom and when you're at Rock Bottom you don't really have a lot of negotiating power you can't say that's a dumb idea because it's sort of like well how's the current one working out for you but I I don't think I actually expected it to work and if I if and I thought if this is ever going to work it's going to take 40 more years because that's how much we're overwriting why do you think it took I mean I'm not exaggerating Paul it took about 3 months to totally change how could it have happened so fast mhm I think 3 months to totally change but that's 3 months of work work right yeah it's it's that same theory that matter is not evenly distributed change has not happen in a linear way you know okay it's only 3 months but you had to run countercurrent to patterns of neurotransmission that were inside of you for years and years and years and years and this is another I think big problem with modern mental health is it's packaged to suit insurance paradigms and and that's not serving the people it's supposed to serve so the idea that whatever has gone on there's 10 sessions of therapy authorized or you know progress has to be gained in a short period of time let's take an inventory of symptoms and let's throw a medicine at you so now your symptom is a little bit better without ever knowing what's under ging it there are things that take time and when we establish patterns of neurotransmission it takes time to unestablished them the example I often give is if if you and I picked a random word and we said it a thousand times we're going to be saying it later to today right if we say it 5,000 times we're each going to be saying it tomorrow and over the weekend right why if we know that it's just a silly experiment why would it stay with us because we said it and the brain's mechanisms are designed to hold on to it because we said it a lot of times that's how it goes the same is true of course with what we're thinking right we're just thinking what we think we put into words it's the same it's thought it's neuronal connections that don't want to go away right because this is how how we've developed we've developed to remember things we've developed to not forget things that are important so the brain says you said that word 2,000 times I'm not just going to for forget it because you said it I mean you know it's really us talking us it's the evolutionary mechanisms so that's been in you for a long long long long time and when you start trying to say something nice right there's a I mean you tell me the truth there's got to be a fear in you that like everything is going to fall apart like here doing this wild Reckless thing right that you're going to take your Edge away cu the the

[01:16:57] Bobby Knight produces great results next thing you know you're going to be lazy and sloly and not care care when you make mistakes yeah but think about in one hand how like outrageous that is like the thought that you could possibly be like a million miles from that right but it's not outrageous to the emotional part of your brain that didn't want to stop it right so it takes bravery to stop it you have to take a chance and that part of you that says you're going to fall apart and you think you feel like a piece of now wait till you stop doing this right you have to say no

[01:17:28] I hear the meat and I'm doing something different it's it's a it's it's a leap of faith in myself and in what I've thought about and learned about myself then you can go and do it and you start running counter to those neuronal connections and then it and then it changes but it takes time it takes effort it takes bravery it takes faith in self So when you say okay it only took two months but you worked really really really hard actually probably four three to four three to four okay so then we're talking about like 100 days or so like really really running against those patterns and making new patterns and then it feels different and look at someone who has known you for over a quarter century and loves you and and also was trained as a psychiatrist and was here when you came out with the remains of the bottle it was not lost on me that you're like oh I God I had done that before and I dropped this bottle and like there was no Edge yeah in you and it was not lost on me that wow that's not how that would have been before and then I think right you're happier you're healthier right this if we think about health span and lifespan coming from the place that I come from right from the mental health side of things and the really is psych

[01:18:45] Psychiatry think is it's active brain function you know emotional states within us this is how I come at Health span and lifespan I think right this is good for you and I know you're healthier inside even without you know the great it's great that biomarkers and all that but there's not a biomarker for that right but I could see and noted not that long ago that change in you and I knew like you are happier and this is healthy for you now I don't want to make it all

[01:19:11] Rosy but just to continue on a on on on on using myself as an example and to talk about an area where it's become it's still very difficult and I've maybe only had a 50% Improvement which again in magnitude is huge but given where I was starting there's still a long way to go right so it's sort of like saying um you know if a person loses 50 lbs is that a lot of you know are they necessarily healthy it depends if they went from 220 to 170 they almost assuredly are if they went from 400 to 350 they probably still have work to go

[01:19:46] I'm probably the 400 to 350 guy in this area which is just general Outburst of anger at a situation that most assuredly warrants anger so to be clear it's something happens that warrant anger but the response is disproportionate to it and it's counterproductive so the exercise here was an exercise suggested by Andy White who of course you very graciously introduced me to and um he said this is an exercise that he does with um patients he's working with who are trying to quit smoking mhm so the exercise is about separating creating a discontinuity between urge and behavior mhm so he says look for the first and

[01:20:28] I'm probably bastardizing this a little bit but let's just say for the next month you know you're you you come in here and you're smoking two packs a day for the next month I'm not necessarily going to reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke but what I will do is separate the urge from the behavior every time you have the urge to smoke I want you to pull out your phone and set an alarm for 40 minutes don't smoke now but when the alarm goes off go smoke we're g to separate that so you're not just feeding an urge every time it comes up you're going to go smoke and sometimes you might not actually even feel like going for a smoke mhm um and so what the exercise was for me was the next time you know you get some something happens something that is you know something stimulates a response in you that is going to be an outburst of anger and that could be you know you're going to fire off a really nasty email to somebody or you're going to call somebody and tear them apart um pause set an alarm for an hour and then come back and respond in an hour and again that's much easier to do over email um than it is to do sometimes on an interpersonal level but not surprisingly when I'm able to do this and to be clear I'm probably only batting 500 meaning there's a lot of times I'm failing to do this and I'm just reacting to situations in ways that

[01:21:52] I almost always regret regret as to responding to situations but when I'm able to do the urge right now is to you know react stop come back respond I mean it's always better right so I guess my question for you here is why is this why does this appear to be a harder exercise um and would you modify the exercise in any way to produce even greater efficacy or am I just being impatient and you know this this one might take years as a opposed to months well anger is very very powerful and anger can Propel us forward like you know I always think of like sprinters coming out of the blocks and if they come out too fast right then they don't have control and they're just flying headlong until they fly face first right and and that can happen right because they're propelled out they Propel themselves out too strongly and anger does that inside of us there's this

[01:22:52] Cascade from what technically is affect to feeling to emotion and it's worth pointing out the difference that affect is aroused in us meaning it's created in us without choice so when we have high levels of emotional response some of it is nature some of it is nurture it's cultivated over the years and and then these pathways are very strong so so something is negative and there's a high level of aroused negative affect right anger right in this case and then that propels forward so so so when it comes in us we don't even know right a is aroused in us we're not even aware of it yet right it's just a split second but now when we're aware of it it has a whole head of steam and it runs through feeling when we relate it to self and emotion when we relate it to others so I am angry I am an idiot right man we went from a lot of aroused anger right through affect to me right and I'm mad at myself right or if the target is someone else or something else that has happened to us and we run right through us as there's a lot of negative effect of anger raised and of course like this is what happens to me we like we like burst right through us and now are like and it's your fault or it's God's fault or it's fate or nothing ever happens right or I'm cursed and now we relate it to the world around us and you know I view this as the equivalent of the

[01:24:11] Sprinter being you know 25 meters from the start of the blocks sprawled face first you know on the on the track it's like it's not good it leads us to unhealthy places so what you know Andy White and Katie Powell they're they're fabulous therapists and what they're so what they're doing is they're saying like hey we've we've got to we've got to put uh a hand between The Dominoes right these dominoes are going this is running ahead we got to stop slow that Sprinter down coming out of the blocks so that so that that person has healthy control over the movement of their body not just flying ahead so what they're doing there is they're trying to slow that down and say you know affect does not have to run right to feeling when we related it to self and run right to emotion when we relate it to other let's slow that down and this is a lot of work that we do you know we we do um intensive programs with with people where people come to us and they may spend a week with us or two weeks with us we do a lot of this work now and and a lot of the time the work is around things like this it's around people like I I want to understand myself better like I know that this whatever this may be is is not good I want to I want things to change and a lot of what we're doing in that time are these strategies like you're saying because they work and we know why they work right but also there's another aspect of this and we do this also in the Intensive work that we do and this is the part I'm sort of most interested in which is in the understanding of it so I so I so to me it's then becomes interesting that that you become very angry if I let's say for me if I become very angry about something like oh the flight is delayed or I rushed to get to the airport and the flight is delayed and I didn't get the text I was supposed to get and you know whatever it may be like that I become angry right and and and I'm very curious as why am I angry like I oh all my flights are always delayed like none of this is true actually right I'm like I'm a very fortunate person I see myself as a very fortunate person I don't feel that I'm cursed or that bad things only happen to me or that people have it out for me but in the moment when something triggers anger that's not how I feel right so the strategies help you slow down what are you slowing down to right and it brings me back to so the slowing down step is necessary but not sufficient for the real insight right it's it it could be sufficient if sometimes just slowing down it dissipates the energy right but we want more than that right I mean that's something right but we how about combining it with understanding which which brings me back to what I believe works for everyone like this is a human thing right and it crosses cultures race religion socioeconomic status like we are humans and we have these drives within us and if we look at there's a an assertion drive to be able to have some healthy control in the world and there's a pleasure drive to feel at least no privation and feel safety right and then also to have good things if we look we have these drives and there is also a generative Drive in us are we honoring the generative Drive are we in Balance then what comes of that if we are doing that is a sense of gratitude and humility so I think my idea of what's going on inside of you when you're able to stop is that that that you're able in taking stock of self and being reflective to feel whether you see and put words to it you may or you may not but but there's an there's a knowing inside of you that actually you know your assertion Drive is is like you're doing well with it right like you're you're you're putting yourself out there in the world and like and I'll take myself like I'm I'm not unhappy with how I'm trying to be in the world right and and I do take some pleasure and satisfaction what I do and I'm able to provide for people and I feel a sense of wholeness and safety and and and because of that I can feel good about myself and I'm learning and curious and like and and I realize like wait a second there like your life is great right there's nothing wrong with your life and I feel the sense of of gratitude because so much of that is blessing right and also the sense of humility we have when when we recognize our own work and effort and we recognize our own responsibility for where we are but we also recognize that that it's also a blessing to be able to to bring ourselves to bear in that way right this is why people say I got an award and it was so humbling you say why would that why would that be right it's because the person recognized yeah I got that award and like I did those things and I worked hard and also isn't it wonderful for people around us to acknowledge me and isn't it wonderful I've got it in myself to do and I'm I'm gosh I'm fortunate enough that I could bring myself to bear so I can both own it and also feel a sense of of the beyond me that oh my God

[01:29:05] I am so fortunate to be in a place where I can own that I worked hard and got something you know and I think this pervades people when those other drives are imbalance so if we go back to what we started at the very beginning how do people have health span that that is a wonderful Health span to be have right and it combined with love lifespan and cognitive health and emotional health the drives inside of people are imbalance and you've got to look in yourself in order to get them in Balance we've been talking about that too right then when they're in Balance you Orient yourself to that balance and you live much more in an appropriate and active sense of gratitude and humility and you feel that when things are difficult like

[01:29:48] I think that the work that you've done let you feel a sense of humility like you are not supposed to be perfect it despite all that you have achieved and isn't it wonderful all the great things in life then the glass bottle breaks and you're like huh you know the glass that that's it right and that's why when I go to the airport later today if flight's delayed and I'm going to sleep in the airport or whatever it may be like that's not going to feel great but I am not going to get down on myself or anything else around me whether it's God or fate or people you know it just it's not right and it's not good for me either and that's another reason we don't do it that's why once you start doing it you make progress right and that's why you say you're 50% of the way there I mean that's a huge achievement and what does it tell me that the next 50% can't be as difficult as the first right so you're going to get there what percentage of people do you think or how often do you encounter this maybe as an easier question of an individual who feels frustrated or upset at themselves for the the following Paradox right which is on the one hand intellectually they recognize how lucky we are any any person I mean you know we talked about this a little bit over dinner last night you know I'm reading this book about the the the the depression the the the impacts of the Dust bow and the depression okay so you know this is 90 years ago and the people living in the middle part of the United States were subjected to condition that most of us couldn't survive I mean the abject horror of what it meant to live in the depression in the Dust Bowl um and the book I'm reading is called the worst hard time which is amazing and so you think about that and you think God that was only 90 years ago right so just what's the luck that per you know allowed me to be born now instead of then had I been born a 100 years earlier I'd be dead I would have died an awful death in that situation so I know that in my head right and then something happens that upsets me and again it almost doesn't matter what it is because you think it pales in comparison to what it would have been like to have born just a hundred years ago and then that creates tension internally because you think why can't you just be grateful for the fact that you you know you're the let's use the airport example right why can't you just be grateful that you can at least get on a plane like it's a miracle that we can do this thing and yeah so what if it's 4 hours late but then you still feel like but I'm still really upset about it um how often is a person coming to you where that's the source of the tension the difference between the intellectual understanding of what should be gratitude and the emotional feeling that is in congruent with it a lot and um and if I could could comment a little on what you said see I think that there's a fallacy there or a problem I don't know how to what word to put to it but something is not real or healthy in the framing right

[01:33:11] I do not believe that you would have just died if you were in the Great Depression in the great Dust Bowl I also don't know that you wouldn't have been happier h I I mean I don't know that yeah yeah I mean it speaks to what we said earlier right I mean maybe you know you would have barely eak out enough food and got some shelter and and kept your family going and and and you're dirt poor but everyone stays alive right or maybe not everyone stays alive but you keep alive who you can keep alive and you have a sense of wholeness and goodness in yourself despite the privation right we we when we set up oh we should feel grateful because then you set up a scenario where like you can't win right because anything you feel bad about you should feel ashamed about feeling bad about because it's not the Great Depression in the great dust bow so what are you complaining about and then I think you've inadvertently set up a situation where the odds are against you right I mean

[01:34:12] I'll think this sometimes where up until a couple Generations ago like probably everyone in my you family from all sides extending back Generations was a Shepherd right so you could look and say wow H look look how fortunate I am and look at the opportunities I have and the places that I've gone and and like and I can get into that way of seeing of like oh oh my gosh this is this is so amazing right but then I'm not giving myself room to say it is not clear that maybe I would have been happier being a Shepherd

[01:34:42] I don't know maybe if you and I were shepherds next to one another like we' have helped each other others flock out we have a a little bit more sheep our families are doing okay we have a lot of leisure time we think and talk like who knows right so look you are you you are not someone else and you are also you now and so a lot of people come with with what you said and and what I try and do with all of them is to say like this is not a framing that we massage I think it's a framing that we just throw out and we I know nothing about you by by like knowing your Reflections on what you think it might be like if you in the

[01:35:16] Great Depression what I know about you I know from now this is when you live your life now and you know what you're entitled to be angry and frustrated about thing sometimes right now do you want to modulate that and keep it inside and not let it run out of the starting box yes right you're entitled to feel you to feel bad about things or annoyed about things at times I mean like this is how this goes right just because we are not suffering we can compare ourselves to people all over the world who are suffering we're living Our Lives if we live them within ourselves and we're the we are the marker of comparison like how am I taking care of myself now how am I exercising the the drives within me now how am I serving the generative drive with me that's between you and you right now and when we bring people back to that you know that's when like think can really really really start to shift because you you then maybe stop doing something that like it's like kind of going to do something and immediately you set the odds against yourself right by having this comparison people will say well I'm not oh gosh you know but I'm I'm not in the war I'm not in the Ukraine or I'm not in Israel or I know that right but that doesn't mean that like you can't suffer now like you it's it's true true unrelated right and the other aspect is as I said like don't be an isometric exercise right like you might do them but like if this is you don't push against yourself right and and that's often what we're doing if I want to go this way can I Glide my hands this way very often what we do is we have 10 units of resistance and 11 of force right and we're doing that within ourselves instead of simplifying I mean the rule of all good mental health which we I believe undergirds Health span lifespan is simplicity doesn't mean it's simple to get to but it is Simplicity like it's really really complicated to start comparing you to the theoretical you 90 years ago like I start getting very very confused right what we all do when we do that and and again I'm not because I do this to myself too right when I just stop and think like look there's me I'm here now I mean I know my own history pretty well I you know I am capable of introspecting let me stop and think like what's going on inside of me am I making a decision am I am I upset with my myself or someone else like I've got to be able to understand this well enough to simplify it and if I'm going to beat up on myself and fog myself to get myself somewhere I want to go that's not how I'm choosing to do it it's just not good and is that why things seem to maybe take more energy out of me than they should like you know these are things if you and I both tried to work with over time then do I now am I more easily frustrated right and and I'm not getting enough sleep where I'm not sleeping as well so now I feel a little bit fatigued it's harder to take care of myself there's more inflammatory markers my body doesn't feel as good so now I'm even more frustrated with myself like what is going on here right we we just need we can stop and take stock of things and decide a path forward where we are not working against ourselves and we simplify down to what the real truths are which I'm not saying that's easy it takes work and it takes reflection and we've got to run counter to some of these established neuronal Pathways but isn't that a lot more a lot easier and a lot more likely to be effective if you're living in the Here and Now with yourself knowing what you know about yourself as you make decisions whether it's what am I going to say to myself inside of my head what am I going to say to someone else what am I going to do right now we're intentional right now in that Fran way we're living in the ego in that sense of the ego being the whole self am I most self- aware I'm aware I don't want the super ego telling me I feel bad about any frustration in me because I'm not a Shepherd I'm like

[01:38:49] I'm not having any of that that's it doesn't help me it makes things worse it's the opposite of simple right and and we can reject having ourselves be out of balance so just like our drives need to be in Balance cuz then the generative Drive is what makes you wake up with a glimmer in your eye right but but we have to be healthy you know in mind and body and these other drives the the assertion and the pleasure have to serve it the same way we have to be balanced inside of us we need some gratification right we also need some self-control how about we have as clear a lens as we can sitting in the middle of it all and another way using a lot of analogies but I don't want fun housee mirrors around me when I'm trying to see what's going on right I want Clarity around me and a lot of times what we don't realize is we create Funhouse mirrors around us and then we get angry with ourselves that we don't understand or that we walk in the wrong direction or that we run into something and in this analogy is the is the fun housee mirror the construct the mental construct that adds confusion such as the example I just gave yeah I think that yeah absolutely a fun house mirror comes into the room when you start comparing you now to the theoretical you during the Great Depression now there's a fun house mirror the funh house mirror when I'm mad at myself because something wasn't good enough and I realized that the standard I'm using is actually perfect right bring another mirror in right I'm I'm mad at myself as something good bring another mirror in if I start speaking to myself through the lens of someone who is so critical to myself right like the these are all the distractions away from Clarity and it is so easy easy like no one else brings the fun house mirrors in no one catapults ourselves out of the block so that we fall headlong it is we who do this to ourselves and we don't have to do this just as think about what humans do like we create so much and we destroy so much isn't that true the destruction in the world around us how long it takes even to create one building that gets destroyed let alone the vast swaths of the earth that we then destroy and the harm that we do to people right so just as in the universe around us there's a there's a lot more Force towards entropy right than there is to things coming together that's why these these small places where like life could be here you know this is true in our lives here on

[01:41:07] Earth it is so much easier to destroy than to create and if we stop working against ourselves as Humanity right we're trying to move forward and create is it 11 units forward 10 back well maybe we'll get that wrong it'll be 12 back and 11 forward we won't survive as a species we do this as a species and we do this as individuals where we work against ourselves and we don't have to do this right we don't have to have needless destruction happen around us we don't have to have a society of Plenty while there are single mothers with children on the streets like there is more that we can do whether it's trying to lift up the people who are who are on the verge of not surviving right who are living in Misery we can also do it with ourselves I don't want to cloud my own picture I don't want to work against myself and if I see with Clarity and I don't bring in the fun house mirrors life goes a lot better and I use a lot less time and energy making it go better and that's true for all of us it's true on a universe level it's true on a global level and it's true within each one of us how important do you think it is for our emotional health to have um sort of peace with non-existence right I I I

[01:42:30] I do not really have a great sense of that and I don't think many people do in other words as is the case in the previous example there's nobody who intellectually I mean no reasonable person intellectually doesn't understand that they will cease to exist at some point we will all die um notwithstanding all the biohackers out there but that knowledge that cortical knowledge is very difficult to process right it's very difficult to come to peace with the idea and let's talk about the best case example which is you live a long healthy life and you know in your 90s you you you die in your sleep I mean it couldn't you couldn't ask for a better existence and let's also assume that everything up until that point is moving in the right direction you don't just die in your sleep you die in your sleep having lived a meaningful life and having had wonderful relationships and having raised children and grandchildren who are wonderful people like let's let's make this the best case scenario and yet many of us I think still struggle with the finite nature of our existence do you think that coming to some acceptance of that is essential for our emotional health I do yeah I I think it's whether it's essential in everyone I'm not sure but I think it's I think it is very important and there's so many factors that work against us that that we can change so this societal idea that getting old is is just so so so so awful and death is something to be feared you know it's it's not clear that that's true and when you see when people are much older and are and are closer to death what they fear is loss of control not death right so maybe we build up a society that glorifies not being dead as opposed to glorifying Living Well right

[01:44:36] I mean that would be a nice switch right maybe we think about health span and quality of life instead of living in a society where we're so afraid of death that we just don't want to die and we're not even paying attention to whether we're happy or not right now so I think we could work against that a lot and we could work against these cognitive tricks these things we do inside of us that torment ourselves like I don't want the voice of someone critical of me living in my head okay I also don't want to be contemplating my own existence my nonexistence cuz what I do then is contemplate that I'm aware that I don't exist and I'm upset about it that's not not existing right if you don't exist you're not comp and therein lies the to me that's the that's the greatest

[01:45:23] Challenge and and I I tell you that I the people I am most envious of are the religious right or or anybody who believes in an afterlife right if if you believe in an afterlife you have a way to get around that issue and if you don't believe in an afterlife then you're stuck with that very bizarre uh idea that seems impossible to reconcile right you know I have thoughts about this and they're they're not sort of fully formed but I wonder about that

[01:45:55] I I think a lot of times people ostensibly have faith but but aren't behaving that way right I mean because we're in a society everyone's fearing death and non-existence but many many many of those people are people with professed religious values and I think often times we're taught religious values when we're young or we identify in a certain way but we don't really you know we don't really know like what do those things mean what I actually think and feel and and I think when people do have a say a deep Faith could be something different right but I think our religious values don't really work against that very much and and you know it makes me I think I I I think it was

[01:46:33] Spinosa whose definition of Faith was like the belief in something that you don't know for sure right and and it's very interesting when people say they know like this is my religious Valu I know that's true I don't think that's Faith right and I don't think our our philosophical and psychological Heritage tells us that I think that's a leap of something because like we don't actually know right so if you think you know and you don't have enough understanding or humility to recognize that there is a leap of faith then are you doing something that doesn't actually help you and this isn't me being anti-religious I mean I think faith is very very important but it's recognize and such there is something I believe but I do not know that thing I believe it now now that's very interesting why does the person believe it how do we see the Beyond ourselves as opposed to just pasting something on that doesn't actually make change because I I think what I think I'm trying to say is when when people feel very very sure of something then it makes me I worry about that and when people feel very very sure that there's nothing I also worry about that if you think about it I find it quite amazing that there are so many things that we know a little bit about that that fills me with wonderment about what else might be there if you think about things happen outside of time and space that's interesting right there have been experiments done where you or

[01:48:08] I could decide what happened in the past not figure out what happened but decide right so time space movement the impact of Consciousness upon the world around us this is all so interesting even we learn about that are going on inside of our brains you know the the The Cutting Edge of neurobiology and neuroimaging and some of the Psychedelic studies and what they've shown going on inside of us tells me I don't know what happens next

[01:48:36] I don't know that and I may have all sorts of thoughts one way or another maybe some of it comes from Early Education and some of it comes from the faith I was raised in but but like I don't know right and and that not knowing I find to be very very hopeful right I don't know what comes next it doesn't mean that I'm going to rely on anything in particular but it certainly means I'm not going to despair about non-existence I'm not sure of that right and I think that's what it tells us I think that's what Spinosa was writing about and I think what great religious thinkers not that I've read a lot of them but when they're they're writing within religions they're writing in these ways too and maybe that engenders a respectfulness I think if we knew that there was nothing afterwards I would hope we could still find a way to be respectful of our lives but the fact that we don't know what comes next is interesting and I think to me that's full of interest and curiosity and hope like the generative Drive in me gets activated when I think about dying now it doesn't all the time right I can feel afraid I can feel but but it can get activate I don't know what comes next and and I think that's interesting and you know things happen outside of space and time there's certainly not absolute and our Consciousness may you know actually change things be its own entity in the world around us and we all have different times and do we have different dimensions like this is out there in the world around us this is out there this isn't pie in the sky like there's academic studies right that are telling us these things when I think about that and scratch the surface a little bit I go huh I don't know okay that's interesting and I think it helps me to feel a sense of real interest and excitement about then living the best life that I can live because if it's all I have then I really I wanted to be good I want it to be the best it can be for me and the people around me but in taking care of myself I'm better for other people right

[01:50:30] I S I feel invigorated by that not afraid and and I think and you see that in people who don't fear death they're happy with their life they're leading life in a way that they can feel a sense of Pride and they feel humble they feel gratitude they're rooted in that and there's often a sense of not always but there's often a sense of I don't know and isn't that okay like think about how many things we don't know right can we take care of ourselves and treat every life as precious this idea that there's nothing special about any of us but there's something special about each one of us and I think not knowing what comes next and the idea that if we think there is something or isn't that there's Faith involved that that that that's a thought process that's a deciding on the part of the person that comes through interest I think that engenders us to to be better to ourselves and better to other people and I think then we stop fearing death and we stop living in this kind of pseudo Cult of like I must not die which is fed by all these fantasies in these places we can get us even in literature

[01:51:38] I think about like no exit a great play by SRA where where people are dead and they're watching themselves right you know that's interesting as a way of like learning something through the fantasy of literature right but there's a theme that runs through that that we're dead and we see ourselves with despair right and I feel pretty sure that's not happen it would really make no sense that that happens right that there's some punishment of seeing ourselves with despair like why would it be they just can't be that and I think if we're open to that we just don't know and the literature and the philosophy and the world around us it is interesting things to say but no one's going to tell us like isn't that awesome I think it is Paul I want to talk a little bit about um how a person can find a therapist that's going to help them be a guide through a lot of the stuff we've been talking about today so you know there are a few facts that people I think are generally starting to understand which is of all branches of medicine um this is one in which the interpersonal relationship between the doctor and the patient and we'll broaden it because it's not just about physician patient but the therapist and the patient the interpersonal connection matters more than it matters in any other form of care between a provider and a patient so it's great if you love your dentist it's great if you you know have a connection to your surgeon it turns out to not matter nearly as much would you agree with that statement yeah like I don't want to use like as the word but what I what word would you use for what I'm trying to say Rapport I mean there have been so many studies that show how important Rapport is and yes it is good to have rapport with one surgeon but it's not the primary factor presumably right so Rapport is very very very important and and one might argue

[01:53:37] IND indispensable and that's why you see studies that people can come at things from different perspectives like you think about the anger part okay so how Andy or Katie may come at it is hey let's talk about getting a a space between the anger and the respon resp okay they also want you to understand it too right I might come really from like the understanding so you go to a place of humility and gratitude but I want you to pause too right I mean we're not doing different things but we're doing what we're doing from very different perspectives that will feel very different if you're on the receiving end of it right and that's why when people say well if we're poor matters and does it matter then maybe it doesn't matter what those people are doing right but that's not true like the the presumption is the therapist knows what they're doing coming at the the skilled part of it from different perspectives but it doesn't matter that the therapist knows what they're doing if there isn't

[01:54:30] Rapport right so let's take that as a necessary but not sufficient piece of the equation MH what are other things that a person should be asking themselves and we can handle the following questions separately but I want to address both a scenario one you are going to seek the help of a therapist for the first time and B you have been working with a therapist for a long period of time and you want to evaluate if this is productive and the impetus for B is I can't tell you how many people I've met in my life who even to my completely untrained eye which tends to be more critical of self than others I look at them and I think what is your therapist getting paid for mhm like like mhm you you were you were having the exact same problems today that you had 5 years ago if anything you seem a bit worse and yet you tell me you're seeing somebody every week MH and again I don't say that to be judgmental I say that from a place of I want you to be better um and maybe somebody listening to this identifies with that but so so anyway again feel free to tackle those separately but what

[01:55:49] I want to understand are What are the questions a person should be asking themselves of the therapist um and per perhaps of themselves in those two situations to make the best choice a how do I find someone denovo to start and B how do I decide if I need somebody new there's a lot of specifics I could say about those things and and maybe we'll talk about the specifics I want to hear those but I think I would start though in a different place okay I would start with an overarching principle because I think the principle always applies and then it can get at a lot of these things underneath the principle right so I would ask does 1 + 1 equal more than two okay so the way that mental health was thought about um say before the end of the second world war it can our minds were conceived of as very transactional so they would say like even now like I put something out there in words you take it in then you put it into your brain you put something out in words I take it in right so there's there's even though they would acknowledge we're doing something the thought was it's very very transactional right and what we see is that's not really the truth and I think Victor frankl's writings after the second world war um were really an impetus to really see this and and led to a whole different um type of psychotherapy that was called existential Psychotherapy still is existential Psychotherapy and it does mapped to the existential philosophers exactly but there there are principles there that are around shared humanness so do you feel like one plus one is more than two when you're when you're with the person you're going to have thoughts and feelings and ideas and and that person is going to have thoughts and feelings and ideas too and and does that create something more between the two of you right and the thought is this is how we find meaning in life that when we're with someone we love for example it's not just it is us and it is them there is an us right like you're or you the other person is who he or she is but together there's something different that that each isn't going to find on their own right and that each isn't going to find with another person the in this case the diad is special the two people together are more than the sum of each of them and I think that's true for satisfaction enjoyment learning in in human relationships and and I think because these principles run wide right so the same thing that would apply applies here too right that that there should be someone whose presence and whose work with you like there's a shared humanness and you're figuring things out and you feel the greater than two of the two people in the room and I think that's a lot of what Rapport is I mean some of what report is is positive self-regard or sorry positive regard of the of the other right and and there're pleasantries and nice there ways we can build rapport but I think they're more on the surface right they're important but that's not what makes real Rapport when someone is helped I think what makes real Rapport is the fact that here

[01:58:58] I am with you and there's something different with us than than there is in just the sum of us like something new and different is here and I feel that when I come in the room to see you right and I think you feel it too when I come in it's it's a real interest in me and a real like applying of one's brain to the other and you know whether we call that

[01:59:18] Rapport or you know I just feel great about that person or man it's so Dynamic like there is something there that is the therapist really being present and and I think that that's an obligation of the therapist we're supposed to know technical things and of course like there are things that we have to learn but we're supposed to give of ourselves in a way that has us truly be present with the person if you if you figure that out whoever the person is Right thinking should I take this the should I have this person be my therapist or should I leave this therapist and try something new I mean if you try that on on for size and it doesn't fit should probably change something how long in the um context of the first scenario which is somebody looking for a therapist how many meetings with a person do you think you need to have before you can evaluate that you know I always say this I talk about this a lot you know you can know if things really aren't right you know if a person is approaching the therapy process and they really want to be there and all of that you know sometimes you can just tell if you're not going to resonate with someone like someone who's not making eye contact for example like hey you can tell or you know you just feel an awkward sense like sometimes this happens with with people and some you could know that okay that's not going to be right but again be fair and reasonable about it say do you really want to be in therapy right because because if if you don't then maybe you're going to find something wrong with everyone right but if you if you really bring yourself to the process then I say you can tell no sooner than you can tell yes right because in the first couple sessions what's going on is you're trying to build a relationship and people need to get to know one another a little bit and how they respond and what their mannerisms are and if they have a sense of humor and you know how much emotional veence is inside of them and it takes time so there's a little bit of a dance like there isn't any you know in any new human relationship so the thought is if something really rubs you the wrong way and you're looking at that honestly you could probably tell no first second third you know along the line if not give it a little bit of time you know five six seven to see do I feel like I'm resonating with this person are we really getting somewhere because again the progress and the perception of progress is not linear yeah right and sometimes it person four sessions I'm not so sure okay so I'm not so sure let's give it a couple more because sometimes by the six the person feels like it's kind of falling flat and I don't feel that there's 1 plus one is not equaling more than two or sometimes you know the stuff we did early on is kind of clicking a little bit and now it's only session six it's two more than four but they start really feeling something so you know there's a process to that but but if one just applies those principles then again I think it's also there's a process to it but it's also a process that you can really apply of I'm looking for things that are real negatives like that person isn't making eye contact that's bad right okay like or I really feel it odds like you can feel it acknowledge it right if you don't be observant be patient you know what's going on inside of you how are you feeling are you feeling helped do you feel uh uh what gets called a holding environment that that the space when you go in is a safe space right and you can be open and honest because so many times people fear criticism where they feel that they'll say something this is often true with trauma they'll divulge something and then the other person will recoil in Fe in horror right and this happens a lot where someone will just talk about you know the the worst thing imaginable talking about and they're saying it and and you'll see this is kind of known in therapy education but if you do therapy long if you see this in people like they're surprised oh my God like I said that right and then they're surprised that that the other person that I did didn't recoil from them because inside of themselves they've held that this is something shameful and someone else should recoil right because they're carrying shame from it right but if you develop enough of a holding environment enough benign regard enough real humanness with the person then that can come out of them without them having even decided it just naturally flows out because they know that they're in a safe place and somewhere inside of them they know that other person isn't going to recoil just like they wouldn't recoil just like you're saying what would you say to your best friend right right so somewhere inside of you you know that you you don't really want to be saying the things you're saying to yourself right you kind of know that because why would you say it to yourself and not someone else right but but that's different than having an experience of it right and having an experience in your case when you were making the recordings you're having an experience of a more accepting self that's great right we can also have that experience with an other who represents a more accepting self if the other person doesn't recoil that's right you don't you're not really recoiling from that either no I think that's actually an interesting example because I really felt uncomfortable sending those recordings to Katie and I think initially I said well I'm uncomfortable because I hate that I'm wasting her time like you know I'm lighting up her phone with text messages of these recordings but that's actually probably less what it was I think it was more I'm ashamed of the fact that I'm doing this and I'm ashamed of how difficult this is and you know what is she thinking when she gets this like again this is a narrative you're making that's incorrect if a good therapist isn't none of those things are true right but that's but that's the thought you're having right right so you have to know that she really wants you to send them right she really wants you to send them and she really wants to help you and she really feels good about you she sees the goodness in you right and then it lets you do something that exposes the shame right I think you tell part of what you feel ashamed of is that you're doing that to yourself right so but you know shame isn't always that yeah no the shame is that this is this is so hard to do this shouldn't be hard to do and I shouldn't yeah it's I shouldn't be doing this to myself and therefore this exercise a shouldn't be necessary and B it should be a piece of cake and it's not so now it's witness cuz think about there's competing shames right so on the one end the shame from of not being perfect right leads you to do something shameful to yourself which is to be Bering yourself look if you if you did that to someone else we would say hey that's good reason to feel ashamed right to to talk to somebody like that just cuz they broke some we say hey that's not okay so why is it that you shouldn't feel ashamed when you're saying it to yourself right shame can help us by changing behaviors right but now you have like competing shame should you be ashamed that you're not perfect and it's good that you're beating up on yourself should you be ashamed that you're beating up on yourself because it's okay that you're not perfect right like this is part of what keeps us in stasis right but then she as the person she she's not completely separate from you and that way like 1 plus 1 is equaling more than two now because she becomes a little bit of an Arbiter or a metric of like what really makes sense here and her reflecting back to you that hey you're you're worth treating better than you're worth treating better than this right and yeah this is not okay for anyone including you like you know it's it's not okay you're not the only person who gets to be beaten up this way then part of that is her seeing that lets help makes it easier for you to change because then you put the shame in the right place like right if I feel ashamed I'm doing this to myself I want to stop and if it's going to take a long time I'm going to let it take a long time I'm not going to be so ashamed it's still here in three weeks that I stop right I'm going to keep doing it but part of what lets you do that it's the exposure to the outside person who you trust because and that person becomes a barometer what's Real and True here and then it helps us get our own minds into place like oh right right okay I do get this right it is okay that I'm not perfect I do not want to beat up on anyone like this including myself like now you've got the result inside of you to do it why because you've been validated whereas before you might not have been so sure if the shame is with the lack of perfection or with the selft talk let's now talk about kind of um sort of another question around the person who's been in therapy they have the therapist um how often do you see a therapist whose Rapport is in the way that they think of Rapport which is getting along but they're not hitting the 1 plus one is greater than two um because again that's can that can be difficult to quantify but but the

[02:07:27] Rapport is such that it's almost enabling the behavior in the client or the patient and there's there's no progress being made and in part it's be and yet the the client feels like hey this is great I have a therapist I love my therapist I see my therapist all the time I go in there once a week and tell them everything that's wrong and it feels really great to do that but if you if if an objective person if you were sitting there looking at this you'd say yeah but things aren't getting better right right like so you know is there value in just having a person that you pay to listen to what's wrong or are you paying this person to help you become better at dealing with whatever it is that's going wrong which might indirectly result in less frequency of these things happening my question I'm fumbling through it a little bit but I think I know what you what what I'm asking so so question one is the first critical step in that that the person themsel must recognize that I need to re-evaluate this relationship and and if so then what are the tools to evaluate that well I think unfortunately yes in the example that you gave because it shouldn't have to come to that you know therapists are people and we know that whatever occupation you you take there's a significant subset of people who aren't giving it their best I mean that's part of of humanity too um so the therapist is is really transgressing something there that should not be transgressed um and you see this right

[02:09:00] I'm not just making this scenario sure it happens a lot because again it's you know not everybody brings their best to their work right and for some therapists it's okay they they'll let the person come and go and they they kind of rationalize well they're kind of still clicking along and you know they're doing okay in this way or that way and and they'll rationalize that what they're doing is a non-doing they're not actually doing anything and the obligation for the therapist is to know

[02:09:25] I know this person is benefiting from this I see where we're going so even if I don't see it now I might see there's I don't think there's going to be any change for the better in six to nine months okay I have to accept that from week to week because I know where we're going to get to if we do the work by the 10th month I mean it's just a more complicated situation but the therapist has to know we're either achieving something now or we're heading towards achieving something that's changing this person it's my job job to be active about that and it's my job to not get complacent or if I see that person wants to get complacent to to to talk about that with them it's just a harder job right but I think it's a therapist obligation to do the job that way now when that doesn't happen then we end up in the situation you're in you're describing soorry you're you're describing right you're saying hey this person is in this situation where things aren't getting better and I think putting a full stop to that like what am

[02:10:17] I doing here what am I paying for right and sometimes that's a good question you know what are you paying for you go buy a gallon of milk you know you're paying for a gallon of milk you go for an hour of therapy what are you are you going for an hour of I want to understand myself and make change are you going for it's an hour I talk about all the things that are making me angry the last week and then that person gives me a little bit of sympathy and I'm no less angry right you know to to really look inside at at what the person is serving and also how good does it feel comfortable does it feel it shouldn't always feel good and comfortable right there should be times when you're talking about something that's not easy to talk about or you know you're crying in therapy you're upset in therapy like it's supposed to be work right it doesn't mean it has to be work every moment all

[02:11:02] I mean there's there's a lot of fun to it too and mean I have great fun doing therapy whether I'm the one doing it with someone else or I'm having doing therapy with Gregory Hamilton has been my therapist for gosh 13 years or so now it's fun a lot too but sometimes I'm upset or I'm crying or he says something to me or I say something to someone it's like whoa that's okay got take that in like it's you know it's supposed to be work that everything in life is that way too so if it's too easy that's not a good sign if you feel sort of a threadbear that's a kind of you said it's hard to quantify when one plus one is greater than two but you do kind of know it often in human relationships you just feel good with someone there's there's something where you're more than the two of you that's why people want to spend time together it's why people become romantically interested in one another it's there's a lot of that going on in in aspects of human relationship let's dig into that a little bit more because it really is I've never contemplated that at all but um as you pointed out you take two people like you and I who were very close friends um the the it's such a clear example of that right um the the the the sort of the creative nature of the interaction but we are friends right and yet we don't necessarily feel that a therapist and patient should be friends right so what are the other what what what are some other questions a person can ask to try to get at that uh that that a creative nature of co-existence well so I'd go back to the framing of it so you think why do we how do we decide people are friends right it's not you can't quantify all of that you're like well there's something there they know something about one another they're interested in one another's well-being right they have points in the past to tether to right that's why however much I may think about myself or you may think about yourself there's something different that happens when we're together right I I leave feeling different why because I saw you not because I saw someone right it would be different if it were someone who's not you right that's that's because we have a real human relationship now we call that friendship because that's what the that's what the language applies to it but that shouldn't be different in therapy right it doesn't mean all these people are friends and they're going out for dinner together like it it doesn't NE to

[02:13:28] It's not that it's that there's a human connectedness and there's something that's greater than the sum of the parts right so if we look at friendship of as an aspect of human interconnectedness and and a human ability to see and feel and and um and be present beyond the self then that happens in friendships that happens in romance that happens in parent child relationships that happens in a therapy room and if it's not then I think there's a problem I think there is supposed to be something greater than the sum of the parts whether we say 1 plus one should be greater than two or we say there's an element of friendship in therapy relationships we can say it any way we want but it has to be more than just the sum of the parts that person has to have real regard and interest in the person have some aspect of the friendliness that friends feel when they're together the existential therapist understood that you know the brand of therapy that that when it was thought everything is transactional you could sit behind the person and it's not as if there's nothing that could ever be gained by that but like that that can't be the Baseline of it right and the what has happened since then with people like

[02:14:41] Harry stack Sullivan or uh or the the existential therapist that that came after Victor frankl's writing R May and irin yolum and they were doing something different they like we're humans being with other humans that's real and I think that that is I think that that is wonderful and when I learned that in in my therapy training when that element was added like oh it's okay to be human because I had an existential therapist who was taking care of me at the time and I also had some mentors who were I thought oh okay you know we we have to think about the other person the session is about the other person but we're both humans and it's going to help them if they see that in me too every now and then it makes sense to disclose something right to talk a little bit about yourself in the service of the other to let the person know something to let them know that you are not perfect I mean I think a reason you and

[02:15:31] I are able to help people is I don't think either one of us tries to put out there that we are not either now recently or potentially suffering through anything someone else out there is suffering through and I think there's a humanness to that that's just real and honest and by the way it doesn't feel better I think to hide behind it like to to pretend people can always hide behind something whether it's socioeconomic or it's a power differential it's a position in life but it doesn't make anyone feel any better like the truth of it is for example we do share humanness with everyone like but like anyone can get trampled by the society around us like lightning can strike us we all suffer you know we all have struggles within us so so acknowledging that like we're all human and we're trying to help one another but we're coming at it from a place place of acknowledging what's going on inside of us and that we are not perfect that's why therapists learn from their patients good therapists learn from their patients absolutely I can think of the life lessons that come why because I'm human too and I don't have all the answers hopefully I have some Education and Training that can let me help you but also helping you will help me too that's true I think about you know was talking to one of my colleagues before this podcast about trying to organize around a few different phenotypes of people that we interact with um in our practice who again um each of these examples which are characteres of course um are people who think everything is fine with respect to their mental health but there's an externality um so so kind of like phenotype one is the workaholic we've talked a lot about this person this is the extreme achiever this person is so successful on the outside that you everybody just assumes you know everything is wonderful but you know a lot of times frankly when you go from the street to the porch you realize maybe that's not entirely true and once you step in the house you realize that's not entirely true um another phenotype would be kind of the another one we've also spoken about is the the op you know the endless Optimizer right so incredibly rigid and controlling of everything in order to drive towards you know perfect health as an example MH um then you have kind of the the very anxious person who really struggles with the the fear of the future um and the fear of the future can be shortterm and it can be long-term but it can be uh and again we should have some fear of the future that would you know allow us to you know do things that are productive but but obviously I'm talking about this in a in a negative way um and and then kind of like perhaps at least for me the most difficult phenotype is the denier right so this is a person who by by by any reasonable metric is suffering but their their barriers to accepting that are so high that you know you you could almost see you could almost make a cartoon about it where you see a person who's missing an arm and you ask them if you can help them because they can't do something that would require two arms and they look at you like what are you talking about of course I can do this thing I have two arms well but you're missing an arm right there you know so um so how do you how do you think about someone be it a friend be it a physician be it anybody trying to to help and get through to any of these phenotypes to to kind of put the thin end of the wedge the thin edge of the thin edge of the wedge in there such that they can at least make a tangible step towards self-help well I think the the first thing to do is recognize okay that there's a problem right and then you go back down this idea that there are these

[02:19:44] Cupboards in the conscious mind and the unconscious mind and there there that if we go and look and scrutinize what is going on inside of us or or we have curiosity about what is going on inside of someone else that we're going to find the answer that that this is not a mystery that just like a Sherlock Holmes investigative process or math problem right one can look at it and and learn things so think about the first example a workaholic again you didn't say someone who works really hard and achieves high but a workaholic so even the the word by definition is a problem right so what are workaholic doing well often times they're avoiding something like they're that's why alcoholics are they trying to avoid something by drinking to get away from it like we understand that but that's no less true with work workaholic right there's something going on inside that person that they're afraid of that they're suffering from that they're ashamed of like something is driving this Behavior so so I think what are you avoiding what are you trying to get away from because workaholic doesn't mean you work very hard and you achieve at a high level workaholic means you're working when it makes absolutely no sense to work so what are you escaping from so so then I think there's a defense here that is usually avoidance as a defense and there's other defenses that come along with it you know the person can put kind of blinders on themselves go in One

[02:21:02] Direction feel that that's good enough but boy aren't they seeing what's on the other side of it or feeling what they would feel on the other side of it so then that becomes a point of curiosity like is there avoidance what is that avoidance what's going on inside that person then you think okay with someone who's optimizing always trying to perfect no there's there's something different going on there which is probably more rationalizing right like things you know we all kind of know that things get to a place that's good enough everyone kind of knows that so if the person is still trying to make something that's really solidly good enough perfect what's going on there like what are they what are they serving inside of themselves they're going to soothe something some anxiety then gets soothed because they do something that's irrelevant right like that's not so let's go look at like why why the why the need to focus on optimizing something that's already good enough there's other things to do in life right there's other ways to spend that time and energy why that Focus so you know it's a process of curiosity when people are very very anxious then then where that leads us is what's going on inside of them that the the they may be you know with the younger people in my practice called future tripping right or you know anticipatory anxiety so is there a way that that person's fear about the future shuts them down right so that they're not doing anything in the present and they don't have to be afraid that what they'll do won't work in the future like that doesn't go well right but but we get into those places so what is that anxiety inside what is it about why is it so high so then again we become curious about that I think you you I think you you called denial is the hardest one and when we think of maladaptive defenses because how do you get someone around maladaptive defenses you're trying to help them understand right so if you're rationalizing there's a little bit of a you know place we can grab on to that right like okay you're rationalizing some of it makes send then it doesn't right but denial can be very very cut and dry and very frustrating to come up against and um I don't know if you met Peter Grover who's a a therapist within our practice who's very very experienced Peter has a sign on his wall says how's that working for you right because that's his Mantra like that's he's very very good at helping people who are in that so difficult denial position by helping them look well let's just look like how's it working for you right let's just so because the idea is then the person's at odds with a therapist right so if you're like how's that working for you you can then together look out at it right where Lon

[02:23:27] Havens who I got to meet many years ago who who in an era when most therapists were sitting behind the patient would sit next to them and look out at the world together right so so you're trying to do that so the how's that working for you is like okay I hear what you're saying it's not saying it's right or wrong like whether you're working or you're doing this that let's just look at how it's working for you right and then you can sometimes that can't really be even answered without some introspective capacity right because

[02:23:57] I've I've I've interacted with people where maybe I didn't ask that question Point Blank but I can almost imagine that if if asked they would respond great everything's great like can't you see everything is great and you're sort of like right you know how do you I I I totally understand that of the four phenotypes described that one is hands down the most difficult I'm just wondering if the people around individuals like that if they care about them and they want to help how can they help them probe even further what you know I mean again you you you you you know you hear the term intervention right a person need at this point you just get everybody in the room who knows them and you just have that that that that you know riveting intervention uh what are the what's the equivalent of that state here it's hard you know sometimes you can come at it because the idea here is the person is not letting you see with them right so you're so you're across from them metaphorically right so what you can do is then to tell them to say to them what how you see it yeah right because is I can't impact you you're not letting me right you're you're bar there's nothing wrong that's your story you're sticking to it right but presumably if if one is having that conversation with a person again there's more 1 plus one is equaling more than two that's why you're sitting across from them like there's some emotional investment there's some respect there's some love or consideration there's something there that when you say hey I just I understand that and I hear where you're coming from and I hear it loud and clear but I just want to say to you that from from where I said as someone who knows you cares about you loves you whatever it may be what I see doesn't seem okay to me I just want to say this I'm trying to force it on you like it's just because people sometimes will remember that down the road sometimes look I can't help this person right now but what I think I can do is maybe put a seed in there that that may come about later like sometimes I'll see this with someone who's say drinking very heavily and and not acknowledging I still feel good I'm not you know I don't feel any different so nothing is can to happen now we may have a set of underlying Labs that that we can look back from and we see where those numbers are trending right so it's not hard from the outside to see but the person is like I don't feel any different there's nothing wrong right so even then sometimes you I well if I can I'll try and put in an idea look at some point you're going to start feeling something different right at that point remember this right because the thought is we're acknowledging like you can't get through to everybody and like that's okay right if you can't don't keep trying cuz like look I want to tell you how this is going to be bad for you that that person has long turned you off and you you tuned you out you can't get anywhere with him but if you do them it's okay I I get it I'm not I'm not the person who who like says you stop drinking or something that's not me that's not what I'm doing right what I can do is maybe plant a seed that

[02:26:54] I think you're going to start feeling something at some point in time this is going to start feeling different remember this then and you know sometimes people do sometimes they don't but a lot of times when people get help you do see that they've taken that inside from sometimes from someone else sometimes I'll see it in my own work where someone who I thought things ended very badly and and the person wasn't helped and they left and I tried to plant a seed and then they come back in a couple years you know I thought about that and like wow that that feels great cuz it tells you you're doing it's a proof of concept that you're doing the right thing by planting these seeds but more often than not we see someone else has planted the seed maybe that was another therapist or was another friend or someone else said that or someone said it a long time ago they read it in a book you know theide is like if we can plant seeds in people who are in denial those seeds May grow but we have to understand when we can't do more than that and stop otherwise you know we could drive the person away and prevent any help from coming that does that make sense one final question I just want to want to ask you Paul is about um how you manage internally the the challenges of what you do in the sense that you know you you you work with all sorts of people across all sorts of spectrums and obviously we didn't talk about it today because we've spoken about it a lot in the past but but you you know you're going to be very quick to look for the trauma in a person's life that probably shaped many of the adaptations that exist today and in doing so sometimes those things are very sad and they're very tragic and um I I just wonder how you you you manage the sadness around that for yourself um I I think about what it was like being a resident right you know patients would come in and they would die you know trauma victims someone gets in someone comes in in a car accident and they're dead or you take care of them and but you can't save them and those things are we don't we don't really get taught how to manage that at all I found that to be hands down the biggest failure of our of our training system perhaps that's changed but but certainly when I went through um there was absolutely no discussion even of that I remember being reprimanded for going to the funeral of of a of a patient um the idea being like you that's a line you never cross and um um you you know you have to block that stuff out basically yeah um so how how do you deal with that well I'd start by saying I agree with you I think at least in our era of training uh medicine did a lamentable job of that and and if you think about medicine hopefully selecting for empathic people or compassionate people and when a person is built that way that one plus one is more than one so you feel part of a Wei if you're taking care of someone and they die you're not that person but but magically it's what goes on in our heads we feel sort of part of them because we we we see that with people we really love who are close to us like they're part of who we are but we we see this in settings where we're we're helping people too and and I don't know if you went through this part of it I remember when you were talking I remember very vividly being an intern and having to really tell myself like I am not this person right because it start feeling like oh my gosh I could see this person is suffering and this and and like it's easy to lose those boundaries so to be able to say like here like I'm standing

[02:30:25] I'm here that person is there the in fact the only way I'm going to be able to help them is I have to know that I am not that person but it wasn't easy and I remember one of my uh co- interns I remember he and I really talking about that and we were trying to do it for for one another like okay like calm down a little bit like you're not this person let's let's step back from it catch our breath and try and help the person he probably remembers we did it for one another and I think it for me it starts with that because that's a physical separation right and then the idea that

[02:30:56] I can mentalize a lot meaning like think a lot and feel things we can all do this but like you do this when you're a therapist you're feeling what other people are feeling you're feeling for them it's easy to keep that in your mind too much then just like if we picked a word and said it 5,000 times it'll be in us tomorrow right if there's something you don't want to do and you repeat it 20 times you're more likely to do it again and the same is true when we have when we can't bound ourselves well enough from the suffering in other people this is why people have post-trauma syndromes from vicarious trauma right I mean this absolutely happens the brain is changed there are biological changes behavioral changes and all of that trauma is vicarious and this is why we see the levels of depression and suicidality and substance uses higher in people who are giving care to others so so it is so important that we have these boundaries inside of us and they have to come I think from this place of balanced drives and gratitude and humility I'm so grateful I get to know other people they share things with me I can help them I can learn from them that is such a wonderful thing that it helps me to hand to to accept the other side of it which is sometimes things that are very very hard to hear or very hard to get out of our minds and I have to have the humility that I am human too and if I keep this in my head or if I'm really mad about this things that happen to somebody we we see the the most awful things people can do to one another that you know I know these things happen I Confessor on the anger the frustration the misery of this and I will hurt myself so my obligation to myself and to the people around me that I care about in the world people I love or people I I I I know and

[02:32:43] I like them like I I want to be healthy I want to be at my best and I have to be able to maintain these boundaries and inside of me which means have the discipline to stop thinking about that right know that take stock of I'm doing the best I can for that person I'm still worried it's not where is not going to have a good outcome like am I am I doing what I can do I can okay I must there must be something else that comes into my mind and and I I find it it is easier to do that as I focus more on the balance of drives I'm being generative

[02:33:11] I'm asserting myself I'm taking pleasure in what I'm doing and I feel gratitude for what I'm doing and the humility to know that if I don't take care of myself you know it'll kill me too Paul I want to thank you again for um for not making not just making the trip out but more importantly of course sharing all of these insights in in a manner that's that's incredibly lucid and helpful um I I look forward to doing this again because obviously we will I do too I do too thank you so much for having me it's wonderful to see you and and I so appreciate being on the podcast thank [Music] you [Music] w
