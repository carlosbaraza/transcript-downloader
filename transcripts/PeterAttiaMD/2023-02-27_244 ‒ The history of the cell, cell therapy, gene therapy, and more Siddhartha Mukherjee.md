[00:00:01] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia hey Sid so great to to see you again it's been a long time since we've seen each other in person the last time we sat down for one of these of course it was in person and we didn't have video now we've got video but we're you know in a different time zone um congratulations on the success of your most recent book um for folks listening or viewing give us a sense of kind of where this book fits into the prior work we talked a great length about one of your books the

[00:00:36] Emperor of all maladies but there was a book that followed that and then of course there's this so maybe put this in the context of those books well so um it's an interesting so you know this is part of a Trilogy and possibly a quartet that I'm I'm working on um broadly called the life series and the attempts of these books is to try to explain and understand how we understand life and how we're manipulating life uh living things obviously particularly humans um and so in an odd way um the the place to begin to some extent the trilogy right now so the first book

[00:01:16] The Emperor all Melody is the second the Gene and now the song of the cell um would be to probably start with the gene now the gene being the the the least unit or the smallest unit of information um uh and then realize as you end the gene that that genes which are encoded in in DNA the molecule DNA are lifeless they don't have any autonomous life a gene is just a molecule it's a chemical and it's the it's the cell that brings it to life and without the cell there would be nothing all of that code would be useless I liken this to the the the human genome um or any genome to a score of Music um but a score is lifeless there's no music in a score it's just uh it's the code you need a musician to bring it to life and the cell is that musician and hence the word hence the title of the book The Song of the cell um the cell brings it to life um so the second book to some extent is the cell um and then the third book bizarrely enough is the first book uh it's sort of like Star Wars the prequel to the sequel to the prequel um where you learn about what happens when cells become average so that would be one way to read the book uh read the series of books start with the gene um move on to the second unit which is the cell and finally end up with the sort of dysfunctional Labyrinth cell and what happens to it when it's genes genes go Haywire a completely different way would be to read them as they appeared um and the reason behind that is that they uh progressively um go downwards I mean the first book was of course a history of cancer and cancer therapy they progressively go downwards and delve deeper and deeper into mysteries of that history you know missing pieces what did we not understand about cancer uh obviously genes and genetics um what we did we not understand about um cancer in terms of its cell biology when the cancer genome Atlas was for instance completed and what do we understand now um so um so this they can also be read chronologically from the first to the third which you would get a different kind of story and that's what's interesting about it you can read it by the way it's possible that my questions statement here is um a bit of uh tainted by a bit of recency bias because I read them in order and of course I've just finished reading the cell because you know we decided on a very last minute basis we were going to try to do this podcast last last minute for the way my podcast Works which is months of preparation so you know I was sort of you know reading the book in the period of the last week and a half which I enjoyed immensely but here's the thing I felt more surprised and in awe of the characters in this book than the previous books and that might sound crazy because you'd think God the you know decoding the human genome what a Herculean feat but in many ways the characters of this story blew my mind even more because of the time and the era in which they had to do their science there were fewer tools at their disposal is that does that statement surprise you or how does that resonate with you well so it it's not surprising um it's because um the characters in this book um are enunciating things that are I think very fundamental now with if you if you take for instance a comparison if you were to do a historical comparison with the history of genetics so you know you would start potentially in the in the scientific word you would start with

[00:05:09] Mendel um and you know Gregor Mendel of course being the the the Pioneer here and then there's an enormous period of Silence uh that follows Mendo almost 40 years in which basically nothing happens um and then you know his work is picked up by other people um ultimately picked up by folks like Thomas Morgan and others um but for a long period of time nothing happens and nothing's relevant um here what you see in this book is very different because you see a sort of continuation um of development so once the microscope is invented in the 17th century um you see from the 17th century a kind of gradual blossoming um of of the science um ultimately ending up with you know someone like Rudolph worked out um who who can make really really audacious statements that you know are missing in the history of genetics until much later um the audacious statement that workout makes is every um every function that we carry out uh regardless of its origin and regardless of what that function is is a consequence of cellular physiology we ourselves and everything that we do is cellular is a consequence of something happening in some cells this conversation is a consequence of something happening in some cell so that's one piece that's statement one and then you get the other Converse statement which is equally audacious in which he says that every um every illness is um the consequence of some cell behaving incorrectly um and these statements are made in the late 19th century what sort of mid to late 19th century then in fact almost contemporaneous with uh with Mendel so you have an enormous sets of leaps in cell biology um which is why this this book might feel sort of you know that these characters are are doing things while sort of you know genetics is still plotting its way trying to understand sort of Mendel's first very important paper and this a remarkable 40 Years of

[00:07:28] Silence whereas in cell biology there isn't that 40 Years of silence and I think also just maybe we take it for granted sometimes today but the Ingenuity that was necessary to even build the tool to permit the visualization I mean we just lost over the fact that in the 17th century we're putting together microscopes but you you actually describe in some detail what the process is like to grind the glass to create the lens to even have the window into this otherwise microscopic and invisible to our eye uh piece of physiology well it's an it's it's an incredible I tried to make one uh myself uh I tried to make uh one of Lewin

[00:08:09] Hook's uh microscopes um and I can tell you you know it was not um an easy cost it was a it was a disaster um and he made 500 of them um these are single lens microscopes and they're about uh you know this big it's about the size of I would say a half a sheet of paper um and the lens is literally the smaller than the size of your eyeball um and so you have this a sense in which you have an enormous amount of Labor of

[00:08:42] Love put into making this thing that's mounted with tiny screws and tiny little apertures so that when you look through your eye through the lens to in a droplet of water um you can actually see these you know microscopic forms so so there's a there's an enormous sense of wonder about how people even began to um to see these and how um how they found them and and what what the consequences of that of that finding were and are people who listen to my podcast are probably used to an idea that I talk about um and you have come across this now said because you were kind enough to be one of the people who read my book but I talk about this transition from medicine 1.0 to Medicine 2.0 and then of course where I hope we're going is the transition from 2.0 to 3.0 and I typically talk about medicine 1.0 to 2.0 as two big events happened and um they weren't you know momentary events they were transitions or processed one was of course the way we changed about the way we changed the way we thought right so it was the Scientific Revolution so once we introduced the scientific method late 15th century we had a new way of thinking about observation and hypothesis and all of a sudden the idea of bad humors and all that stuff sort of went away but really the big moment became germ Theory once we understood microbial agents and that we had a way to treat them we really leapfrogged into the era of modern medicine and if you look at the mortality rates as a result of that it's outstanding I mean there has been no bigger reduction in human mortality than the reduction of death that comes from infectious diseases what I had never really thought of until I read your book was that couldn't have happened without this deep understanding of the cell I mean it's it's obvious when I say it that way but in effect this book describes how medicine went from effectively witchcraft into where we are today and and of course you're gonna we're gonna talk about this in more detail by the way but but I mean does that make sense to you oh absolutely makes sense to me in the sense that it makes sense because the um the the you know the introduction of of uh of being able to ultimately see germs um and connect germ Theory with uh with human disease um as you say it took medicine from witchcraft to the modern era um you know think of any procedure childbirth um uh any surgical procedure anything that we do and think of the effect of antibiotics on that procedure and think of how important it is that that these antibiotics are now available and and the life saved I mean just childbirth

[00:11:34] Alone um uh the the capacity of saving lives to antibiotics has been enormous and has just really been transformative in terms of you know again as you say moving medicine from from Witchcraft and and and that's because what's astonishing in in in this in the piece that I write about microbial uh biology and the discovery of microbes Peter is that microbes was were imagined in the abstract uh long before they were seen so um what's interesting is you know people like Lister the great surgeon who began to sterilize his instruments um folks like um you know and I have a small biography of them in the book uh folks like Samuel Weiss um almost ignored by medical history now but the seminal wise discovered that that you know the people that that doctors were transmitting microbes tell the story you know I have it in my book you have it in your book I I'm really glad that more and more people are writing about him because it always breaks my heart when someone dies without their do and some of us is the example of that and it's it's a heartbreaking story but it's a remarkable example of this transition so Samuel Weiss was a junior obstetrician in Vienna um it's important that he was so Junior and he made a very uh important uh and

[00:13:07] Incredibly important Discovery um so Samuel Weiss was delivering children and there were two maternity Awards what one in word twos um and this is why it's important in medicine I came to listen to your patients you know the famous adage in medicine is the most important question that you ever ask in medicine when you're trying to diagnose a patient is to ask the patient what do you think the problem is um and it's the one we forget the most right doctors never ask that question but usually the patient will tell you the problem is they'll say you know I think I have an infection in my lungs or you know I think I'm you know depressed because of X or Y reasons um because I lost my father so so

[00:13:54] IL wise learned to ask people uh of us of a bizarre aberration that was going on which is that in world one the the infant the maternal mortality rates from childbirth were uh astronomically High whereas in word two same Sim similarly same people same women coming in were much much lower and he asks a very simple and he knew this because he the you know at least

[00:14:27] The Story Goes whether it's apocryphal or Not The Story Goes that um that in world one um people you know mothers would beg to to be admitted into into the the safer World while they would beg not to be admitted to the where you know they would have a 30 mortality rate or a 20 mortality rate one out of five women this is an incredible number if you think about it so some of us began to answer ask the question why and he looked at all sorts of variables um he was sort of a classical epidemiologist so he looked at all sorts of variables and the variable that he found was that in in the first word where there was a high mortality rate in in childbirth the um it was run by doctors and these doctors he figured out were running between autopsy rooms so doing autopsies on probably the very patients that they had killed um and then running and then without cleaning their hands um delivering babies essentially examining patients delivering babies Etc were two on the other hand was run by nurses nurses were not doing autopsies not touching any decaying or dead material and there was no mortality so sample wise made the hypothesis again remember this is the junior obstetrician in Vienna made this hypothesis that what doctors were doing is they were transferring some and this is these are his words some material substance from the decaying decomposing dead bodies that they had autopsy into the bodies of the women that they were examining internally and thereby transmitting that material substance and that material substance was was the source of the putrefaction or the infection that these women were getting and he insisted that the doctors washed their hands with a diluted sort of a a diluted version of bleach and he saw that suddenly now the mortality rate plummeted and so he made this argument now remember he didn't have a microscope he didn't have this is all in the abstract but he made this argument that this material substance was responsible for this what we what was then called child red fever or maternal uh infections and the transfer of the material substance could be removed by washing hands by hand washing and so he in the abstract sense he had basically founded germ

[00:17:04] Theory yeah I mean completely prescient yeah an incredible aggression and the idea of a material substance that's what's important about it um right it wasn't just bad air in a vague it was on bad air it was not you know uh bad humors it was not it was a material substance and of course if you had if he had the capacity to look down the microscope he would have found out that that material substance was in fact uh nothing else but uh but uh web germs and the sad thing we you know the the the the sort of the the epilogue to the story is the guy dies in an insane asylum basically having been ridiculed he's ridiculed he the doctors don't want to the last thing that the doctors want to do is to admit that they've been you know um uh infecting other women so he's Sam otherwise is ridiculed and he's sent off to an insane asylum and ultimately he dies um in in impoverished and and never

[00:18:05] Vindicated yeah it's um again medicine is full of these stories but but yes this is this is what it was about the book that really captivated me was this thing that I've taken for granted so so much you know of my existence in in medicine is what really allowed this this Leapfrog and frankly far more so than the genetic Revolution I mean we could sit and talk about has the genetic

[00:18:32] Revolution delivered on its promise I mean in some ways yes in some ways no we thought of course in whatever it was 22 years ago when the human genome was coded that was basically going to be an equal LeapFrog forward it turned out not to be we'll come back to talk about some genetic stuff but I want to go back to a question that you pose in the book that

[00:18:53] I had never contemplated and I have not been able to stop thinking about it and I love it which is foreign what's the evolutionary drive for multicellular life so like let's talk through kind of yeah we go from these single cell organisms that have all of their own Evolution built into them and then look at the complexity that we are today I'd love you go through this very elegantly well I mean it's the let's pause for a second to contemplate single salad organisms so they are bacteria you know uh protozoa yeast Etc they're extraordinarily successful you can't imagine how successful they are they live in virtually every environment that you can think of you know they live in boiling water they live in thermal vents they live in inside volcanoes they live

[00:19:46] I mean how successful is a single cell organism so you could the the bizarre question that you should ask is not why uh you should ask why we exist at all why is yes why what is the reason that you know we we have about you know several trillion cells or trillions of cells how did we why do we exist why not why aren't we all bacteria um and people have been trying to answer the question and the initial idea in the 80s was that there was a massive leak evolutionary leap from single-celled organisms to multicellular organisms but what's surprising is that if you look at evolutionary history and if you look at all the evidence from Evolution history it turns out that multicellularity evolved from single-celled organisms not once but independently multiple times and it's it's you know it used to be called a major transition it actually turns out to be a minor transition in other words there was a great evolutionary drive towards becoming multicellular and you can ask the question then well if single cell organisms are so damn successful why ever be a multicellular organism the quick answer is we don't know but all the evidence suggests that it has to do with um several possibilities the leading possibility is predation so it's much more higher it's much harder for um a predator to eat a multicellular organism for several reasons one of them is that it's bigger number two is that it has defense systems number three it is that it can move away from predators through specialized apparatus apparati um so that's one idea the other idea is is food and resources multicellular organisms can have you know can act

[00:21:40] ACCESS food and resources and there are other ideas about how multicellular organisms came to exist and essentially conquered the world as we know but that said single-celled organisms are still the Champions we are just a minor fixture uh in the world if you took by weight all the single-celled organisms in the world and their diversity uh you would be shocked at how successful they still are remind us what ratcliffe's experiments with yeast demonstrated I I that was I mean I I had never heard of that experiment before so it was uh you know I'm reading this like

[00:22:20] I'm reading a thriller novel well William Radcliffe was a professor um uh who studies this transition this evolutionary transition from single cell to multicellular organisms and he did this actually an extraordinary simple experiment and he sort of just thought about thought about it uh over Christmas uh with travisano his uh his advisor he said well what if we just take some yeast um and culture them and we um we basically allow them to grow and and so remember you start single-celled organisms and we just collect the sediment so anything that's multi-celled is obviously going to sink to the bottom of a flask we collect the sediment and then we allow that sediment to grow again in another cycle of evolution so this is sort of Darwin in a bottle um so we allow that to evolve another cycle collect a sediment allow that to evolve another cycle and buy about 30 or 40 such Cycles he found that the yeast had evolved and this is astonishing I have pictures of this in the book into these sort of snowflake like multi-fingered multicellular forms and really a new organism a multicellular yeast and what's interesting about them is that when he let them be by themselves so no more recollection no more sedimentation they continue to propagate as multicellular yeast so in other words a he had basically created a new life form um which is multicellular and what is even more interesting is that when he looked at these multicellular yeast they started to acquire specialized functions so you would imagine that one way that these multicellular yeast would reproduce is that one cell could butt off and create a new multi-fingered multicellular use that would be one way that these organisms could be produced but that's not how they reproduce the way they reproduce is that a specialized series of cells that sit in the middle of this snowflake commit a purposeful cellular depth and I repeat the word they commit a purposeful cellular suicide such that this the snowflake can break into two parts two snowflakes and grow out new fingers um so this organism has now evolutionarily speaking learned the word learned implies that it has some

[00:24:47] Consciousness but that's not true true this is just an evolutionary process it has created a specialized Furrow in its Middle where these cells basically can divide into two forms and what's more is that he's now practically has done many versions of this experiment he's done it with different organisms he's done with algae he's done with various other organisms and what he finds is that there's even more specialization so these um these new creatures that's the only thing I can call them one little channels to deliver nutrients they form pores they form secondary structures so he he's really sort of created a new kind of life and just by doing nothing I mean just by allowing it to evolve naturally and remember this is 30 40 Cycles uh which may be you know 60 80 90 days so you can imagine over the course of you know several billion years of History the extraordinary amount of diversity and specialization that could happen in evolution that leads to people like you and me having trillions of cells very committed to doing one thing or another thing or many other things you know because my kids who were my my boys are five and eight at this point they're as you can probably imagine obsessed with Dinosaurs so we're non-stop watching every imaginable thing

[00:26:13] I you know I I paleontologists are the most important people in the world at this point I can't help but wonder when I watch these Recreations of what we assume dinosaurs to have looked like I mean at least we know about their size how did Evolution allow something so large to be you know in existence so many millions of years ago and are we basically seeing a correction now in other words was was that just the pendulum swinging too far towards multicellular where you know boy you hear you have things that can really defend themselves that can really get away that can really go after prey but of course they're too sensitive to a reduction in food or something like that or is that just totally unrelated and had it not been for you know volcanic eruptions and things like that maybe we just wouldn't be here today and dinosaurs would be the sentient uh higher you know um higher order creature a little bit outside my my faith my pay grade in some ways but um but you know there's lots of theories uh I'm certainly not a paleontologist so there are lots of theories about the the extinction of dinosaurs um what we do know is that that that you know that these life forms were also very successful in their environments the problem was as many people have hypothesized um that um that they they sort of reached a maximal capacity of size um and um smaller mammals or mammal-like creatures um were much became much more adapted or adaptable to the environment but there are a thousand theories about dinosaur extinction um including uh changes in the atmosphere it changes you know meteors and various other volcanoes and events which you know you can read in in most paleontology yeah I just I just wonder if there's something about their size that became their downfall Beyond you know the obvious external factors and it just made me think of that when I was reading that segment about yeah there's a beautiful essay if I remember correctly by Stephen Gould um where he talks about a natural biophysical limitation on size and that's because the volume to surface area of any creature uh reaches a place in uh where the volume to surface area becomes no longer sustainable because the the the the surface area of a

[00:28:56] Preacher um does is no longer able to deliver the oxygen and the nutrients required for aerobic living yeah um I'd encourage people to read it um I don't remember the name of the essay but it will find it it has to do with the rhinoceros and what the size limits of creatures uh can or cannot be interesting so let's go back to Something in in the book where you talk about the four types of cell therapy um when you spell it out it sort of makes sense but I'd never considered this before um I think it's I think it's I think it's an illustrative framework for people to think about the era of medicine that we live in was so what are these four areas of cellular therapy you know I tried to create a typology of uh the four types of of uh ways in which we could use cells as medicines um the first is the simplest one of all which is to use a drug or a substance to change the behavior of a cell so the simplest example would be an antibiotic you're using a drug to kill a microbial cell while you're sparing normal human cells so that's one the the second one is um the use of um the transfer of cells from one body to another body without any modification the simplest example of that would be blood transfusion so you're transferring red blood cells piglets and other cells from one body to another body for therapeutic effect but you're not essentially changing the cell itself the third is the use of a cell either transferred or by itself in a dish in a bioreactor in a chamber to synthesize something so I remember I said that that

[00:30:45] DNA is inner it's a lifeless molecule if you put it inside a cell in the right context the right cell in the right context the cell will start making proteins out of DNA and those proteins could be very useful so insulin for instance you can only make insulin in cells um or you can that's how insulin is generally made um so antibodies are made by cells the you know the antibody perceptin that you use in breast cancer is made by cells so that's a third use and the fourth and the finals is the one that you know is is coming up and and now becoming more and more prominent as we as we move into this new era and that is the use of a cell where you make a genetic modification in a cell and then either transplant it or or use it for a therapeutic uh reason um so for instance uh car T cells which

[00:31:42] I'm sure we'll talk about are examples of a genetically modifying T cells and putting them into a human body um I've been doing as you very well know a series of experiments on on bone marrow transplants in which we genetically modify the bone marrow uh using crispr and other techniques and then transferring them into human bodies um and and essentially creating a a genetically engineered cells now people let's finish up a little bit on that last Point people often talk about gene therapy and I always remind them that gene therapy is really Cell Therapy uh if you put the gene in the wrong cell in the wrong place at the wrong time you get nothing you get the you get the disaster um so gene therapy is really a mechanism to put a gene inside a cell and that would be the fourth the typology as it were and then the book goes through elements of these four typologies uh examples and elements of these four typologies as medicines well let's touch on a few of them I you know because you and I don't have the ability to sit here for the next three days which is what it would take to do each of these their their appropriate service there are a handful that I really want to to talk about so let's talk about the story of of Jesse gelsinger because that is one of the earliest examples of you know gene therapy in a human we could talk about what went wrong but let's let's use it let's use Jesse's story just as much to explain the state of the technology at the time the vectors the vehicles the methods by which genes were transferred so um you know let's just start with kind of what disease did Jesse have why was gene therapy viewed as the the um the solution as opposed to whatever the other three methods would have offered

[00:33:37] Jesse so Jesse had a genetic disease uh he was a young kid I think 14 15 years old 16 maybe um he was a young kid um and uh you know I've interviewed his father I interviewed uh I've had a very very moving interview with his with his father um but nonetheless Jesse was a young kid he um had a a defect in an enzyme uh which uh is related to the processing of ammonia um and uh ammonia-related substances in in the body um and so um uh the idea back then um and we're now talking uh uh I think it's about 22 years ago yes about 2 000 yeah yeah two thousands um at at the University of Pennsylvania the idea was that if they could create a virus uh which would then go to Jesse's liver um and start making this the correct version of the gene um then the uh then Jesse's disease would be ameliorated so they created a virus um that they thought was going to be harmless um it was a variant of an adenovirus and then they genetically modified that adenovirus to now include the corrected version of the gene that Jesse had a problem with um and then they Infuse that virus into

[00:35:07] Jesse's body hoping that the virus would go and infect because viruses infect cells and deliver its cargo the cargo would be the corrected Gene um and thereby correct Jesse's disease um so that was the that was the idea behind behind that therapy let's explain two things before we go on with the story um we we didn't say this earlier so I think it's worth clarifying we don't really consider viruses in the same category as bacteria yeast fungi why is that what is it about viruses that do we consider them living things are they not living things on their own I mean they basically just can train contain DNA and RNA but they're sort of parasites in it they need us to replicate so that's right so viruses are not they don't meet the criteria of of living things um they are uh essentially uh uh a strand of RNA or two strands of RNA or multiple strands of RNA or DNA uh that have been packaged usually with an envelope and with some decorated with some proteins on top but they themselves by themselves they can't reproduce they can't make copies of themselves which is one of the reasons that they're not considered living the only way they can reproduce is they when they go and they go and attach themselves herbs to cells let's say to human cells or any other cells and then they use the reproduction apparatus the duplication apparatus and the reproduction apparatus and the synthetic apparatus that's present in the cell to make copies of themselves and once they've made copies of themselves they butt out of the cell um and then they go and infect more cells and make more copies of themselves and so forth so that's that's what a virus is and in Jesse gelsinger's case the idea was that this virus would essentially infect his cells and create now but it would insert because the wires were genetically modified it would insert the its genetic payload which consisted of the normal gene into into

[00:37:17] Jesse's liver cells the liver cells would now start making the protein that was defective in in Jesse's case it was Gene this is gene therapy and then by the abide in doing so it would reverse his his relatively mild but his his disease so what what happened then they used this adenovirus they injected him and it went pretty bad pretty quick yeah so um a rather terrible thing happened and again I have a very very moving testimony from his father um which is in the gene a little bit in this book but but really in the gene a a terrible thing happened so um in retrospect we think what happened is that um Jesse mounted a very very vigorous immune response a virus is a foreign object a foreign body um and you mount an immune response to it especially if you for for whatever reason have been exposed to that virus before and people now suspect we don't know for sure that first you know adenoviruses cause common colds because they you know in circulation um there's a suspicion that Jesse had been exposed to that virus uh the the the wild form of advice uh before um perhaps through a common cold or something like that and his immune system went music because it was now recognizing not one virus particle but millions of particles suddenly uh into his body his immune system went berserk and when the immune system goes berserk like that you basically have terrible consequences because your body is recognizing yourselves as far and the virus is more and the you know it goes on what I call a kind of immune Rampage um and that immune Rampage can kill you and unfortunately Jesse died from the consequences of this uh very hyperactive risk immune response raised against that virus and and died and in fact the whole field of gene therapy was frozen for almost a decade as we learned to slowly understand the cause of that death and how we could prevent it in other people and so I think in response the field said look we need to look at slightly more immune protected or privileged sites to to dip our toes back in the water and and so so tell folks a little bit about what's a safer place to maybe consider gene therapy as as the field moves closer to that well there are many things that have happened it's not just safe places I'll give you some examples again I'll try to create a typology for you um so one thing you can do is you can uh there are safe harbors in the body by say fibers I mean places that the immune system doesn't usually reach easily um so it just by chance that retina turns out to be one of them uh there's not a lot of immune cell infiltration into the retina so you have a chance to use gene therapy and in fact there are now several Gene therapies that have been approved um that allow you to insert um or inject viruses so that you can get um some corrected Gene that's missing or abnormal in in the retina so that's one place there's some other places in the body it turns out by coincident the testes is another place although we've not used that for gene therapy so that's one thing you could do the other thing you can do is you can actually there are new drugs that can dampen down down or tack down the immune response so you can think of the immune response as a dial what you can do is you can dial the immune response down so that the immune response doesn't respond so briskly uh to the gene therapy you can hide the virus so you can make a virus such that your body has not seen such a virus before so you can actually use a novel kind of virus that has not been that won't raise a Brisk immune response the fourth thing you can do is you can actually give the gene therapy in small doses it's called hyperfactionation so that uh fractionation small fractions so that the immune system doesn't again go berserk seeing this massive bolus of a dose of virus so those are some of the strategies and they've been very successful so that now um you know the the number of deaths from this hyperactive immune response still remain um but they're much much much more controlled than in than in Jessie jasmber's times so you alluded to an example earlier of of car T cells um but I think it's you know one of the great successes of cancer when it comes to treating uh cd19 or B cell cancers um let's let's use that as an example to explain um how gene therapy can can work in that regard well so cartesa is a very special example of gene therapy so in a car T

[00:42:34] Cell uh what happens is that you extract T cells from a human being who has cancer um you extract their normal T cells and you use gene therapy to weaponize them so that they can attack cells including cancer cells so you're essentially turning the T Cell a T cell is part of the immune system its job is to hunt out and kill uh foreign cells including cells that have been infected by viruses or foreign cells that have somehow entered the body that's their job that's the job of a T Cell it's a it's a it's a Cell It's a foreign cell detector built into your body so now you take that T cell and and weaponize it to recognize the cancer cells as foreign and then you re-inject them you grow them in a Petri dish in the laboratory and you re-inject them into the body um and you know our laboratory has done a lot of this work we are now um uh doing this in in India um the the costs of of doing this are astronomical in the United States um almost 500 000 to a million dollars uh per person we're trying to reduce that cost dramatically 24 perhaps even 50 fold in India using new technologies

[00:43:54] Etc we've treated about 11 12 patients already and we've just released the data it looks very very very good um and so they're usually used in blood cancers like lymphoma leukemia and myeloma they've not been so successful in solid tumors for reasons that we don't fully understand that we're still trying to understand but that's what a car T cell is it's a weaponized T cell that goes and kills cells in your cancer cells in your body said what what is the difference why why is there a 20 to 50 fold reduction in cost doing this in India as opposed to the United States because this is of course one of the jugular issues with oncology is marginal treatments not that

[00:44:39] I'm saying car T cell is marginal it's actually one of the few beacons of success but cancer is full of marginal treatments you know extend median Survival by two months at a cost of a hundred thousand dollars how much of that is just a structural American problem versus um sort of uh you know people that are able to go outside of the existing channels of IP uh some of it is a structural American problem and some of it is not so um obviously the structural American problem is that um for reasons that we're we are trying to still investigate uh 90 of drugs including drugs in the cancer space fail and pharmaceutical companies make the argument that they are trying to recoup the r d costs the research and development costs of those Fair drugs with the ones that are successful now that's a complicated and I would say somewhat specious argument because you could ask you could say to them well why do these drugs fail in the first place is it because drugs always fail is it because you didn't understand something about the human body that you uh therefore took this drug all the way to spend Millions perhaps even billions of dollars on the drug um so that's one reason um the second reason is so so that would be the standard argument the second reason is that car keys are intrinsically expensive to make um their success rates are incredible so these are not just one month two months survival my book begins with the story of Emily Whitehead she was seven when she was treated with cartoon therapy she's now 17 or 16 applying to college completely cured so you have a situation in which these are these are miraculous drugs um you you know we've seen people who've been had terrible leukemia essentially eradicated leukemia forever um and become cured the problem is that they're intrinsically hard to make to weaponize the T cells you need to make a virus that virus is expensive to make it's labor intensive the quality control that's required is much much greater than you know making aspirin or making any other tablet so um and then of course growing the T cells you have to grow them in an incredibly sterile environment um you know where you have to basically put on a hazmat suit to go in um it's called a GMP facility but it's a highly highly sterile environment it has to be monitored it has to be checked for you know that a single bacteria or a fungal infection in that flask of a T

[00:47:21] Cell will now basically take that entire batch away you you can't give that give those back so there are some intrinsic expenses um now you ask the question why how can you reduce the cost well we reduce the cost by several ways one is that we um basically we've learned to make the virus much in a much cheaper way we've reduced the cost of uh you know the the patent burden um by essentially I I I think by really making successful products and not spending millions of dollars on unsuccessful products so we don't have to recoup all that r d cost um we've changed the machinery um we've changed the way the cells are harvested and finally of course hospital treatment and therapy in India is much cheaper to start off with so that you know adding them all together um comes to you know almost a 10 40 to 24 reduction in God so let's now use another example of gene therapy which is maybe the harder of the problems which is you have a person more like Jesse where they have a germline mutation that results in a pathology yep and the goal is as an adult you know let's pick sickle cell anemia as an example um in some way sickle cell is so amazing that one single amino acid difference can have such catastrophic consequences on the life of a person but you want to now just change that I mean it's a single amino acid it's very you know we know exactly what genes drive that how does one go about doing that and where are we in the um in the realm of approaching success there um so um fantastic new results in sickle cell anemia um published in very major journals and will continue to get published so ancient disease as you know single amino acid mutation if you inherit two copies then you get sickle cell anemia terrible disease your blood cells in low offensive environments form sickles you get you know they basically clog up it's like

[00:49:44] Plumbing clogging up um and you get essentially what you might consider sort of micro Strokes all over your small uh the small blood vessels in your body terrible pain um associated with this um so the answer would be in gene therapy you know what if we could change the uh the the mutated Gene so there are two or three approaches that have been so far tried one is um using new technologies uh Gene editing

[00:50:14] Technologies to basically change both copies of the gene to now make them into normal so take out your bone marrow which is where blood is made um change the gene from the abnormal Gene to the normal sickle normal hemoglobin Gene um and then reinfuse that back into the into the patient so that's a gene correction strategy there's another strategy which is very attractive and and fascinating um and I'll just briefly mention it so it turns out that the fetus the human fetus um has a special kind of hemoglobin which is different from adult hemoglobin and the reason it's different is that the fetus has to extract oxygen from

[00:50:59] Mom's blood and Mom's blood um when by the time it reaches the fetus has already been depleted of oxygen because it's gone through her body so this is called fetal hemoglobin um and so um basically the fetus has a special form of hemoglobin the oxygen carrier in blood that can even extract oxygen out of mom's blood um and so another approach to sickle cell anemia is to forget about the sickle Gene problem and basically in an adult somehow reactivate or Express or make a field hemoglobin um in that case you don't need to correct the gene the G you leave the gene as it is you just make fetal hemoglobin which is very very Avid as an oxygen uh oxygen delivery machine and the cells don't sickle anymore because they don't have this this oxygen problem and that too has been successful there have been several trials now showing that if you activate fetal hemoglobin uh you can do that so just to summarize then you can either do gene therapy to um

[00:52:13] Express the corrected version of the sickling Gene that would be the gene is called beta Global uh that has been performed the second approach is to use Gene editing technology to change the the gene back to its normal form the third approach is to reactivate fetal hemoglobin um in adults to essentially correct the the hemoglobin defect and all three are being all three of them are in trials and all three have shown various measures of success my my impression is that during our lifetime we'll see a cure a permanent cure for sickle cell anemia so so this kind of dovetails nicely into I think a term that most people have heard of but I think that the details of this are pretty important and this is the idea of of crispr now I haven't had Jennifer Dowden on the podcast yet I would love to at some point so we don't need to necessarily go into the great depths of of crispr but I think some history is probably relevant especially as it pertains to the topic of our discussion which is cells bacteria and viruses or bacteria as the cells and how they interact with viruses a way to protect themselves but I now want to kind of use the story of crispr to talk about another tool by which one can can you know impart this type of cell therapy so you know the world of genetics was turned upside down in a very important way um by the discoveries of

[00:53:42] Jennifer doudna Emmanuel's property and several others I should mention ten Zhang and George Church among others and there's a history of this which is in the book um for a long time there was the question of whether the human genome is a library imagine the human genome as a massive Library um if it was printed in normal text it would contain 80 000 books a massive encyclopedia stretching across a massive Library and imagine that you wanted to make a change in one word in that Library you want to take book 61 on shelf 47 and make a change from verbal to herbal uh in that Library this was a dream of scientists for a long time and no one could do it and then Jennifer doudna shot Frontier and then assisted by Feng Jiang and other people figured out that there was a bacterial system evolved millions of years ago that could make that precise change in one word in that entire Library um either deleting that word in other words erasing it simplest change or potentially changing the word to another d word um that's it's an incredible genetic

[00:55:29] Revolution so as we move forward into this new universe we have the capacity to change the human genome in a deliberative and um I would say a a processed manner um so just take the example of sickle cell anemia that we gave before we can change that Sickle Cell Anemia Gene to a normal Gene by using this technology we can change the a mutant or abnormal cystic fibrosis Gene to a normal Gene the normal version or the wild type version using this technology so it's obviously extraordinarily important um and there are many many applications of this technology and it's exciting because we can do things that we couldn't do before involving changing genes to new genes changing genes to their wild type variants or their more common variants and so forth so um we now have have the capacity to do this we can do this with embryonic cells we can do this with embryonic stem cells we can do this with bone marrow cells we can do this with T cells car T cells the the it's a revolution and all I can emphasize is the depth and breadth of this revolution because it's enormous so two two follow-up questions the first is explain using the library analogy how this system differs from the approach that was used 20 years ago in the case of Jesse gelsinger that we described where an adenovirus was used I mean what's the difference in scale and elegance between what you just described which is in the 80 000 books you can go to one page one word and make the change versus that other approach yes so um so again imagine the human genome as a massive

[00:58:03] Library 80 000 books um printed on a page um and so the old technology the technology that was used with guest Jesse gassinger is the technology in which we uh by analogy I'm using metaphors and that and and analogies here we would insert a new page into that 80 000 page Library um so you would go into the library 80 000 books around you and you would take a page and insert a new page into that Library a foreign page the library the librarian could come in this case that immune response the T cell or the B cell immune response and come and say wait a second that's gonna it doesn't belong that's not a page that belongs and that's what happened with Jesse dozinger and other people the librarian would come and say librarian being the human body would come and say wait a second you're inserting new pages into a library that's no good um and would prevent that and it seems to me that you didn't even it was much harder to know where to put that page I mean if you knew a priority I really want that P to be between page 87 and 88 you might accidentally insert it somewhere else right exactly and the librarian would say well why are you putting it into you know

[00:59:47] Jennifer Egan's book on the Goon Squad um because it doesn't belong there you you just inserted that page new page the new gene into a place where it doesn't belong and he or she would say I I don't I don't buy this I'm not I I'm not going to let you do that that that that's absurd you're reading along with you know

[01:00:15] Chekhov or Eagan or whoever and all of a sudden you find a new page that's been taped in the virus that's carried in the new Gene the new virus um and you say well wait a second that that doesn't belong there and that was where the technology sat for years and years and years then um Jennifer doudna short Frontier and others discovered a method in which you would do just quite the opposite you would go into a page and say listen I have the right page in the right volume of the right book and I'm going to change one word the first kind of word that they could change was just deleting a word um and this was using a viral system called crispr and you could just erase a word and then more and more research showed that you could change the word and as I said you could change the word verbal to herbal uh by chaining a single letter and for the most part leave the library intact and if you were a very Vigilant library and you would say that's okay you haven't put in an extra page in you know uh Charles Dickens book you've actually gone to the right book and change the right word in the right space in the right time from one to another and that's the subtlety of what crispr allows us to do it allows us to make extraordinarily precise changes in extraordinary precise ways in a massive Library which would not be possible otherwise so you alluded to this at the outset of your description which was um you could make changes to an embryo right you could take an embryo and you could make a genetic change which now has pretty significant consequences because it is now a germline change this is different than you know if you made a change in a non-germline Cell way down the line and I guess as things would have it the first documented example of this created quite a controversy um so maybe briefly tell the story of JK and the the ccr5 Gene and um and why that and I guess more importantly is what are the implications of that um pretty unethical episode so um again I would encourage people to read the book The Song of the cell um to get all the details about it but um a Chinese scientist uh Jakey um made a somewhat bizarre decision um and I'll talk about why this is it or was bizarre um there is a gene in the human genome that um makes cells resistance to HIV infection um there are many genes but that's this is one of them the the Chinese scientists in this case uh decided hey John can decide that he was going to make a change in human embryos with Gene editing technology the technology that I just described which would make the child of a parent couple in which the man was HIV positive the woman was HIV negative and imp make that change in the embryo and implant those altered embryos into the mom so that they would be HIV resistant because of this change um the problem so sounds great on paper the problem is that their risk the risk of these children to acquire HIV because they were produced by IVF is basically zero they don't they cannot get HIV the sperm doesn't carry HIV um so if you produce a child by by this method you basically have a zero risk of

[01:05:16] HIV infection and so this is what it wasn't medically necessary right that's it wasn't medically necessary um let me take a step back um Peter the book makes a I make a very big distinction between disease and desire um disease is fundamentally linked to suffering um when we talk about disease we talk about human suffering when we talk about desire we talk about the capacity the idea or the aspiration to ameliorate suffering even when there's no suffering involved as far as we can tell now in this case there was no disease the children had no risk of disease they couldn't have any visceral disease the desire was an entirely scientific desire to create a genetically modified embryo so in this case in particular the desire was that they would create a modified embryo and that his angry would be the first in human history to create a human embryo with genetically on altered stem cells cells so uh he went ahead with this project and he created to uh girls we don't know their real names they're their names have been called they've been called Lulu and Nana um and what he obtained was not exactly what he hoped to obtain which is not that precise Erasure of verbal to herbal in a single book in the entire uh library of 80 000 books what he obtained was um a much cruder version of that um and scientists across the world were concerned about you know did he abstain informed consent was there appropriate uh use of you know did the parents even understand the language that we're using now remember because of this was an IVF procedure the risk of these children getting HIV was Zero so again we come to the question of disease versus desire they had no disease the only desire was to create someone who is potentially resistant to

[01:08:12] HIV infection so we have this situation which is very unusual where desire the desire to change human embryos the desire to push the frontiers of science overwhelms the disease where there is no disease and so the scientific world became extraordinary incensed uh about the idea that you know this scientist had had really crossed the boundary between disease and desire now if this had been some disease that the children had inherited cystic fibrosis sickle cell disease

[01:08:57] Huntington's disease some terrible thing that they would encounter in their lifetime the scientific Community would have been much more sanguine about it but these children these two twins that were born had a zero risk zero risk of acquiring HIV from their fathers because the sperm had been watched sperm don't get infected with HIV so there they they were basically um they had they had no risk of the disease so what was left was desire the desire to be first the desire to be create new human human embryos and that's what was very incentive you know that's what incense the scientists and the community of scientists you know there's probably no greater example of the relationship between science and philosophy um you know people might want a little bit of a reminder about what a doctorate degree is formally called right a doctor of philosophy and so when you think about this question it it becomes kind of difficult right and I and I think um in in Walter isaacson's biography um of Jennifer doudna I you know I think this topic is explored in your book this topic is explored um where does one draw the line right so you know Huntington's disease is a great example in the sense that you have a genetic you have an acquired genetic mutation that is a hundred percent penetrable in a devastating disease that shortens life and leads to immense suffering would we find many philosophers of science who would say that it is wrong to alter the embryos of uh adults who have Huntington's disease or carry that trait that Gene to prevent it from going to their offspring which by the way if you play the thought experiment out would eliminate

[01:11:04] Huntington's disease altogether because these are germline mutations like how does how does the scientific and philosophical Community merge over questions of that nature and then of course just to tell you eventually do we move that further to APO E4 LPA other thing other other genes that are not as penetrant right so ap4 is a risk factor for

[01:11:26] Alzheimer's disease or early Alzheimer's disease just to give you an example of how devastating it can be um for particular people who have combinations of AP board and other other genetic mutations that increase their risk for early Alzheimer's disease but um I think the scientific Community would say for Huntington's disease the side of the community would say listen this is a devastating disease with a huge pensions by benefits we mean if you inherit inherit the gene the chances that you'll have the disease is very high sometimes that's not the case right so you might inherit a mutation in some

[01:12:19] Gene whatever it might be but you might not get the disease bracko one is a good example you're right you might inherit one gene but you never may have you may Escape having breast cancer in your lifetime um Huntington's disease is a very high penetrance so in other words if you inherit the mutation the likelihood that you'll have a disease is very high um I think the biomedical Community would say that for diseases like

[01:12:50] Huntington's disease it's probably worthwhile um doing an intervention of whatever that attraction might be but the biomedical Community would say that for in this case in HIV yeah this was obvious it's it's it's not work it's not warranted and the place oh sorry go ahead and and I think that that the biomedical

[01:13:18] Community would say it's not necessary it's not part of the it's it's not part of the Continuum of disease versus desire it's it it it it it moves towards desire without moving towards disease I think the other examples of things on the clearly desire Spectrum are pretty obvious right like enhancing intelligence or physical traits like strength size Etc of all of these areas the one I find most interesting is around Mental Health right which is we understand for example autism and schizophrenia have an enormous genetic component um on the surface it might seem like hey wouldn't it be great if fewer people were born with Autism and or schizophrenia but it's really nowhere near that simple is it and there's a Pandora's Box upon which we have no idea what we could lose as a society if we were to sort of sterilize quote unquote some of these conditions um you've obviously touched on this and I want to come back to sort of mental health because in some ways where we're going to go next in this discussion I think is to the last cellular uh territory right the the the cells of the brain to me that's kind of like the most complicated cells of the body in a sense and of course this is one area where it's very difficult to appreciate a phenotype under a microscope or in a scanner um and so I think part of it has to do with the complexity of these genes but but how do you think about what might be inevitably questions that

[01:15:05] Society faces around the use of this type of precision Gene editing when it comes to genetic conditions of the of the brain well the brain is the most complex of all organs and um it's important to understand that complexity um what we know about diseases like autism and schizophrenia is that they are broadly speaking [Music] um two kinds of genes in the entire

[01:15:41] Spectrum of genetics that have to do with mental diseases one kind of gene is what I call a shabji meaning it pushes you really hard so think about height forget about autism for a second think about height height is a genetic has a strong genetic component tall parents tend to produce tall children short parents tend to produce shorter children so we know there's a general component to it now there are genes in the spectrum of controlling Heights that are very powerful shab genes they shove you in One Direction or the other so one example is Marfan syndrome Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder a single

[01:16:45] Gene one gene if you inherit copies of that Gene you will likely be extremely tall and you might have other medical and other complications but you will be tall for sure um there's a story that Abraham Lincoln may have inherited my fans uh the marfanji okay so that's a shaft Gene um those are relatively rare in the human population of very tall people the more common uh variant is what I call uh not genes nudge versus Sharp nudge genes move you little by little by little by little by little towards increasing Heights and there may be hundreds they may be tens of hundreds of genes that may increase your height little by little by little by little by little until you get five feet ten inches five feet nine inches five feet 11 inches six feet etc etc it's on one gene but hundreds if not tens of hundreds now transfer that same idea to Mental Health okay there are certainly genes in the human genome that change your neuron physiology the physiology of your nerves that are shoved genes in other words if you inherit them just like Marfan syndrome you are likely to get much more likely to have mental illness in whatever form it is uh they're relatively rare and they are inherited in families there's a great book um on this um written recently about a family that has multiple kids with schizophrenia

[01:18:59] Etc [Music] um I think it's called Fallen River Road um correctly okay but most mental illness just by analogy with height is not the consequence of this shove phenomenon but our consequences of what I would call Death By A Thousand Cuts small nudges that would push you towards depression schizophrenia autism

[01:19:34] Etc and in fact we haven't even found those genes yet even though we know they exist in some cases we haven't found those genes yet so the the capacity to change those genes is very limited because you know the examples that I gave you or Jane editing Gene alteration technology are limited to one gene two genes three genes but it's very very hard to find a way to change those genes hundreds potentially tens of hundreds of genes in the mental health Spectrum so it's not as if we can all of a sudden wake up one morning and say I'm going to change your mental health or change the mental health of your embryo based on the understanding of our shop genes because it just won't happen so let's now dig into this complexity issue around the brain um you know it's uh

[01:20:42] I I've tried to explain this to people and I've never been able to do a great job of it you do a great job of it in the book describing it's a mystery right and you came up with a way to describe it that I thought was fantastic which was and I want to make sure I'm getting this right so correct me if I'm wrong you said there were two types of problems in science there are the i in the sandstorm problems versus the sand in the eye problems and as the cellular biologists and neurobiologists were getting deeper and deeper into the brain and it really seemed like they had figured out this thing these axons the the movement of electricity these Action potentials they were figuring this out but they had a little piece of sand in their eye uh what was that piece of sand and and again feel free to expand on in this if I haven't if I haven't provided an eloquent enough setup but it was it was a beautiful description um it's um um it's it's a fanciful description and it's uh it's an important distinction um and it's a philosophical instinction um the i in the sandstorm problem is a problem in which you encounter something in medical Sciences where the information just doesn't fit um it's it's being in a sense form and I give the example when we made the transition in physics between Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics and einsteinian understanding so in other words you reach the place and all of a sudden everything didn't fit the the bending of Lights the presence of uh relativity

[01:22:39] Etc Nothing fits so you needed a completely new Theory uh a new paradigm Adobe shift in Paradigm paradigmatic thinking that's the eye in the Sandstone problem so in other words there's sandstorms everywhere and you can't make sense of the real world um that's one kind of problem and I'm interested in those problems this the the sand and the eye problem as

[01:23:11] I call it is is a different kind of problem the sandstorm in the eye problem is when everything fits except one fact and it's very important to understand that both of those are really really interesting because the sand in the eye problem says that our theory is almost right but it's not right because there's something a fact that won't fit and the particular example I use is is neuronal transmission so so when people discovered neurons in the brain they figured out basically by looks looking at an anatomy that neurons in the brain weren't that there was a space between them that nerves weren't just wires if you were an electrician filling out an electrical uh situation in an apartment right you what you wouldn't do is put spaces between the wires so that all of a sudden this that space would become a communication between wires you just hook the whole apartment up but when people like ramonica Hall and other scientists figured out how to solve this problem they understood that all of a sudden that that nerves have spaces in between them in fact they had a name for these spaces it's called a synap a synapse and that is an eye in the sand problem because you say to yourself wait a second if the nervous system is just electrical wire is strung together why would you place a space between two electrical wires and the solution to that problem turns out to be extraordinarily important for

[01:25:16] Neuroscience because what happens between nerves is that an electrical conduction moves between from one end of a nerve to the other and then and here's the kicker it changes from an electrical conduction to a chemical signal between one nerve to another and that chemical signal re-sparks or Sparks and the an electrical conduction so you're going chemical electrical chemical electrical chemical electrical and you could say what mad person would ever devise um or what evolutionary process would ever devise a system like this and the answer is the reason is very important because what you're what your nervous system is doing is in that transmission between electrical chemical electrical chemical electrical chemical what your nervous system is doing is it's putting weights so that in the chemical transmission and in an electrical impulse could come down a nerve but let's say there are 10 nerves or 10 neurons nerve cells that are impinging on one nerve cell you could assign a weight as to how much this one was transmitting versus another one and by assigning those weights by assigning those calibrations you could say one is louder than the other one is softer than the other one inhibits the other and it's those combinations of inhibition loudness etc etc that allow profound things like sentience and conversation and

[01:27:24] Consciousness and so forth the analogy that's very important is this is exactly or similarly to how and I said it's an analogy this is exactly your similarity to how neural networks work there are there are ways put on how one layer of communication communicates with the second layer of communication in other words some are louder than others some are softer than others imagine discriminating a dog from a cat you could say that a very loud signal in that discrimination if the animal happens to bark you know that for sure that's not a cat that's a very loud signal a very soft signal could be the weight of the animal some dogs are lighter than cats a very loud signal could be the way that you know the snout of an animal is fixed with the head of the animal dogs have a particular snout head combination cats have a particular standard combination so by adjusting the weights of these combinations we think by analogy that this is how the brain can discriminate between dogs and cats um we don't know this for sure because this is an area of science that's still in process but this is a Classics example in the 1950s of the idea that why on Earth would you take an electrical signal convert it to a chemical signal and then convert it back from The Crucible the answer is because it was just an electric boot signal you know we'd be a box of wires and a box of wires without the weight between individual signals between the wires is a useless box because we don't understand or we cannot understand how to construct a Learning

[01:29:39] Network between these a box of wires whereas we can understand how we can construct a Learning Network between electrical and chemical stimulation because we can modulate the strength of that chemical simulation such that we can really actually learn a process does that make sense it really does I mean another way that I like to explain it is using music right which is the electrical signals that travel down the axon are digital and maybe because I'm an engineer I do tend to think in terms of digital versus analog processes but if you explain that look digital means it's either completely on or completely off there is no modulation and imagine an orchestra that every instrument could only play at one maximum decibel level or not at all you couldn't have any modulation of sound it would be a very awful sounding music but if now each of those instruments can go up and down in

[01:30:46] Crescendo and decrescendo and modulate you now basically have kind of the analog adjustment of music that's that's how we make songs and I think right that's probably a cruder analogy but I think it kind of also gets at this point which is I mean again it comes back to how did Evolution figure this out how much trial and error went into producing something so remarkable so brilliant right I mean like you again you wouldn't think to engineer this system necessarily well I mean I think the the the reason

[01:31:23] Evolution figured it out is is again learning um uh a purely electrical system uh which is sort of like saying you're playing some music but you don't have any modulation yeah um you know you're you're listening to a score and the score has no modulation right so you play everything at the same volume at the same tempo at the same time that's on music yeah that's not the song of the cell what evolution figured out and by figured out I don't want to put a anthropomorphic idea on it but what our evolution converged on is the idea that music has Tempo it has space some pieces are software some pieces are louder and by altering this loudness softness as we move along in our neurons that we can produce not just a mechanical um output of the score but but real music and and and your musical analysis is very interesting because that's what we're producing we're producing not a mechanical output of the score we're producing a learned output a mature output of the score and that mature output has to do very much with you know modulation some parts are louder some parts are softer some parts speed up in Rhythm some parts slow down in rhythm and that is ultimately the music of the cell but also the music of the brain so there's many systems we haven't spoken about but there's one we would be remiss not to speak about because it's near and dear to both of our hearts so you um when you went to Oxford to do your PhD as a Rhodes Scholar you ended up in a lab where you learned

[01:33:32] Immunology which of course would come to serve you very well as in oncologist and a hematologist today I want to talk about a couple of things there first is you spoke of course of your Mentor Enzo in the lab help us understand what it is that was sort of bestowed on you from an education perspective from a learning perspective as a doctoral student that we don't really get in medical school I mean you you know you would go on to Harvard Medical School you'd get a great medical education but

[01:34:10] I think anybody who spent time in a lab will understand that there's just certain things that can't be taught in a classroom you have to learn things by being in a lab if that's the language you want to be able to speak what are your what are your Recollections of that that period of time especially in the beginning when presumably the learning curve was very

[01:34:29] Steep and you're drinking from a fire hose and you don't know much of what's going on but you've committed to this path of becoming a scientist first a physician second it's a very different kind of thinking process um uh I like to make medicines and when I make medicines I like to make medicines that are important for for human life hopefully for saving lives I've talked about some of them um and we we've spoken prior podcasts about some of the new medicines that I've been involved in inventing um textbook knowledge in medicine is important and biology is important because it lays the groundwork and the foundations of what we know and what we understand but textbook knowledge only gets you so far because when you come into the actual laboratory you understand that there are things that are predictable there are things that are not predictable and then you get into these eyes I in the sandstorm and sand in the eye problems um which are very important um you you learn to recognize failure you learn to recognize how to troubleshoot your way out of failure um none of this is in a textbook open a textbook of biology any textbook or biochemistry biology and try to find me a section on troubleshooting you won't find one troubleshooting your way out of failure is a the most standard way that we think about medicine and biology run a clinical trial how do we select a patient so let's say you're running a phase one phase one two B clinical trial I I run I have six open trials right now how do you run a clinical trial read a textbook nothing will tell you about how you select a patient for a clinical trial how you manage a patient with uh complications from a clinical trial there is no information anywhere in that textbook about running that trial so similarly run run an experiment which will set you up for a clinical trial there is no information in that textbook about how to troubleshoot how and where and how to do that science that allows you to make it into human medicine um what if for instance you suddenly find that um the medicine that you that you're working with are you trying to create um isn't pure that there's a contamination um how do you how do you remove that contamination there is no method you can't find a textbook and so what you do is you ask your peers who've done this before you and you say what did you do and that's not in a textbook that's not in any book that's not in the book that's ever been written and so I want you to write about that I wanted to write about that process of learning by doing learning by being learning by experiencing and that's why that whole chapter exists in the book there is a kind of learning that we do by doing that would be by being that we acquire by acquiring that is not it cannot be found in any book or textbook in the medical sciences and there's no way around it you know there are a couple of really personal things I want to I want to ask you about some of them for selfish reasons I want to start with writing um for all the times we've had meals together I don't know how this hasn't occurred to me to ask you but how and when did this and I and when I call it a gift

[01:39:06] I don't want to undermine it Sid because I don't want to suggest it doesn't require an obscene amount of hard work but the reality of it is if I spent the rest of my life writing I would still write like a child compared to an adult in the way that you write so at what point in your high school undergraduate Etc did you realize that you had a brilliant way to write and I and I will say this I think you are hands down the best medical writer I mean best writer who happens to write about anything that has to do with science and medicine I mean it's really it's outstanding Sid well thanks for the compliments uh you know writing is not an easy process for me um but it's also a a somewhat weird process for me and by weird I mean I

[01:39:57] I throw in everything um in the next book that I write maybe this conversation that we're having or some aspect of this conversation some question that you asked in this conversation will find its way into the book so um I I I I I have this policy in which I don't make any uh that there's nothing that's outside my box it's all part of the Box all part of the whole story so um again I I find that that that writing is a way for me to think a way for me to work through my thoughts um and the analogies and the metaphors and the the metaphorical parts of my writing are really not in service of writing they're in service of making me think they're in terms of making me understand why a certain phenomenon is related to another phenomenon

[01:41:11] I draw from history I draw from mythology from Philosophy from our conversations from interviews and everything goes into into a book um and it's in some ways I feel as if I had to invent the genre because you know it was so siled medical writing was about medicine it wasn't personal it wasn't I mean there was sharp distinctions between memoir and case histories there were sharp distinctions between you know uh deep history and an interview or journalistic writing and I said to myself you know these distinctions are arbitrary they are they only exist to serve a kind of secondary purpose why not erase all of them and make a new kind of writing in medicine or in in life because the the most important thing that I think people told me about medical writing was like was that when people read writing about medicine they want to enter your Cosmos you don't want to enter your world they want to know what it's like to be like you um and so I said okay uh I'll show them what is it like to be like me well it's like to be to experience intense um it absolutely intense exhilaration when a clinical trial is successful absolute depths of depression and crisis when a clinical trial fails um absolute anticipation absolute apprehension absolute admiration for people who on Whose shoulders I stand that's what it's like to be like me and and when people said to me show me your world I said okay I'll show you my word but I'll show you my word in in a way that that's like to be like me what is it like to be like me I I I am like you I have terrible days I have very good days

[01:43:56] I have exhilarating days um I make inventions I those inventions work some of them don't work um and all of it is wonderful and terrible at the same terrifying at the same time I want to bring you into that and that means I will combine Memoir journalistic writing traveling writing philosophy mythology and everything I'll throw everything in there so that you understand what it's like to be like me there are two things you talked about in the book Sid that were completely unconnected but immediately in my mind we're connected and it probably has to do with my own world um as you know said I think a lot about the end of life I think a lot about how we can delay and push off the end of life and one of the things that I think a lot about is how quickly life can vanish in a person when they fall and an older person I don't mean a 10 year old and these two things that uh you write about and again totally different parts of the book run you you talk very openly about your own depression that really kind of kicked in a year after your father's death which resulted from a fall and near the very end of the book you talk about the end of virtual's life which I didn't I was not aware of how virtue died I I was completely unaware of that that he ultimately died as a result of a fall and a broken femur and within less than six months he was dead which is unfortunately far more common than people realize I mean it is the leading cause of accidental death and the mortality is you you know said from a person over the age of 65 if a person at that age or above falls and breaks their femur depending on the study it's anywhere from 10 to 30 percent mortality at 12 months and you do a very good job of explaining the why because a lot of people when confronted with that fact simply can't understand it and I was again confronted by it just two days ago when um the the swim coach of Stanford while I was there and I of course I didn't swim at Stanford but but many of my friends did and I sort of knew him and I got to know him later after he had retired um and he fell two weeks ago broke his hip and two weeks later he's dead never really recovered from the surgery that's a very extreme example it's it's it's interesting to me but you know um what I what I couldn't believe was how you tied it back to this cell right which was here we have one of these

[01:46:49] Giants of cellular biology who Falls and dies but it's actually the result of a cellular process one cell you know it starts with the the osteoclast and the osteoblast and the Matrix of the hip and ultimately it leads to organ failure um that's not a that's not a leap that I think is easy to make it's not it's not obvious well it's it's it's obvious when you think about burkhar's own idea that the body is a citizenship yeah well said um and the citizenship Falls when one part of this essential Falls imagine a citizenship in any in in any capacity right all of a sudden your Bureau of

[01:47:38] Transportation decides to take a leave for 20 days the the trains in New York City stopped running to the train stopped running and therefore people can't go to work uh people can't go to work and the economy collapses the economy collapses and all of a sudden people who are dependent on small changes in their lifetimes wage workers collapse um and then the the entire system the net the network of systems collapses all because you know the Department of

[01:48:21] Transportation closed down for two days um that's what happens in the human body that's the liability in some ways of multicellular existence there are many advantages we talked about multicellular existence as advantages but they're also liabilities because you depend on your pancreas for insulin you don't depend on your brain your brain doesn't make insulin you depend on your brain for senses and Consciousness you depend on your muscles for movement your brain can't produce movement with our muscles and so there's a citizenship that that bodies develop and have developed with each other so that we together perform as organisms say it again another personal question how much did you weigh the pros and cons of writing about such personal matters as your own depression

[01:49:18] I mean we we do still live in a world where it's not entirely clear to me why we view depression different from hypertension um you know for example if a person says I have hyperlipidemia and I I take 10 milligrams of Lipitor a day I don't think anybody bats an eye but if somebody says I'm really struggling with depression and I take an antidepressant it just has a different valence to it for some reason I don't again I don't know why that is I really don't um but in the in the in the presence of that knowledge you still chose to talk about this [Music] um why well Peter is a very conscious Choice it was not unconscious I talked to my family about it um and I made the choice after that conversation um

[01:50:14] I agree with you I think that depression it can be um what's called an organic disorder a disordered in mood regulating neurons in your brain just like type 1 diabetes is an organic disorder a disorder in the inability of pancreatic beta cells to secret insulin um the reason is different I think is that we associate a kind of victimhood to mental disorders um and that kind of victimhood is punitive it is it it blames victims for being victims in a way that you know you don't say that oh you know you're hypertensive because you um have genetics or behaviors etc etc that are related to your hypertension but depression and mental disorders grief depression and perhaps even more complex disorders schizophrenia have a sense of blaming the victim and the victim being the person who's um the the experiencing the disorder um that victimhood I think has to do with the idea the brain is separate from the rest of the body it's a special order and yes of course it's a special organ there's no doubt about that but on the other hand it's also an organ that has physiology just like your pancreases physiology just like your heart has physiology and so what I want to get away from is this idea of special victimhood um and talk about the brain as a cellular cluster which is just a cellular in some ways just a cellular cluster like the pancreas or the heart or the liver is the cellular cluster and thereby remove this or defend or even challenge this idea of victimhood and and responsibility because most people who experience severe political depression experience it as a consequence of of course of environmental and emotional stimulation the grief of dying the grief of that situation

[01:52:57] Etc but they but but there are neuronal or nervous nerve cells and nerve cell circuits that push them in biochemical and chemical ways towards the state in which they cannot function um and I want to highlight that that absence of function if workout was alive today workah would say that absence of function or that dysfunction is not dissimilar to a person who has a failing heart um or a failing liver because that function is a dysfunction of mood regulating circuits and neurons in the brain just as type 1 diabetes is a dysfunction of of insulin regulating cells in the pancreas and that idea again is actually very important and I think radical um in in this book and in all my books

[01:54:12] I I agree with you completely I think it is entirely radical and it's I think very difficult you know I I I spoke about this with Carl deseroth um if you haven't read his book by the way it's a fantastic book as well I haven't I've read this book it's yeah it's incredible and and Carl was a classmate of mine in medical school and he was equally brilliant um then as as he is now but but he talks about this idea right which is it's this entire field of medicine I'm referring to Psychiatry for which we have not one biomarker for which we have not one radiographic finding that lends itself to a diagnosis and so in the example of that failing heart and that failing liver I mean we have a menu of things to Aid in the diagnosis in fact it's much easier to make that diagnosis today than when

[01:55:04] William Osler had to make the diagnosis 125 years ago I mean today a medical student can diagnose a failing heart and a failing liver given enough data and yet there's still this black box inside of our brains in some ways and um I I think I just you know I find it very interesting and I I can't help but

[01:55:30] Wonder where we will be in 20 years like when I when I think about oncology today and I think about what the wish for oncology is in 20 years and I think about Psychiatry today and psychiatry in 20 years I feel like there's even more potential in Psychiatry and of course I think the potential oncology is enormous well I I think I think you you've hit the nail of the head which is to say that you know biomarkers will help and our are always helpful

[01:56:05] But ultimately it's a clinical decision um when you see I always tell people you know um who haven't been in clinical medicine when you see depression you know depression you know that that this person has a dysfunction of the neural circuits that regulate mood just like a patient with type 1 diabetes has a dysfunction in the neuro in the cells that secure the insulin um and even if there are no biomarkers you know it this is what humans can see about human other humans um there's a there is a disproportionality or a uh this um a a disconnection between the level of grief that a person experiences and the level of grief that persists at the level of honoree the level of um psychomotor inability to move um that a person experiences when they're when they're clinically depressed so so I think that that there are even in the absence of biomarkers

[01:57:28] I think there there is a new age that is coming um and and a respect I think for the autonomy of patience who experience neurological and psychiatric diseases and I think as you've said before desert writes about them um very carefully and very thoughtfully there are many people Andrew Solomon has written about um about all of this and I think it's very important because you know we could find therapies for these some of them may be related to things that you and I are very interested in like alterations in diets alterations in diets plus medicines alterations in in human physiology that could reset brain circuits electrical stimulation as Helen mayberg and others have been doing and to treat the problem as if it was you know just a problem that is sort of an active phenomenon is to minimize what the problem is

[01:58:34] Sid there's so much more I um wanted to talk with you about but as not surprisingly we we've we've gone pretty deep in a few things and there are topics like the entire immune system the epigenetic phenomenon and how we get into cellular reprogramming and yamanaka factors I mean there's we got through about half of what I wanted to talk about so I think the only reasonable thing to do here is to say once the book tour is behind you once we've both got a little bit more breathing room we should sit down again and do part three where we where we talk about some of these other factors you you have a wonderful way of explaining complicated ideas um and and frankly I think perhaps the single most important thing I wanted to talk about today which was to bring all of this around the future of Science and the culture of anti-science that is that is propagating

[01:59:26] I I I I hesitate to not touch on that now but I don't think we could do it justice with a glib and short discussion and I'd I'd I'd I'd with your blessing like to postpone that as as yet another topic we can explore uh hopefully in 2023 would love to um and and good luck I love your podcasts and I have loved being on it so well thank you Sid and uh congratulations again on another

[01:59:51] Masterpiece and um I'm looking forward to uh to to helping to spread the word so that many more people uh enjoy the uh or experience the joy of reading your work thank you Sid [Music]
