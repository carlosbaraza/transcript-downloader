[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter thea m.d. calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'm your host Peter Tia I guess this week is my friend Apollo Oh No for those of you who might not recognize Apollo which I would guess is not many of you Apolo Anton Ohno is an eight-time medalist in the Winter Olympics across three games 2002 2006 2010 in short-track speedskating which is one of the most intense crazy sports to watch we're gonna have lots of videos of it in the show notes and if that weren't enough he also went on to win

[00:01:12] Dancing with the Stars which sadly we don't get into in this episode though I wish we did because we were talking about it over dinner and it's simply another manifestation of the type of drive and determination that he brought to his sport he brought to that show as well he has a really unique upbringing he was raised by a single dad and his father who was an immigrant played just an unbelievable role in his life through the good times and the bad which I know might sound like a bit of a cliche but the level and the detail at which we go into it in this podcast I think his is quite inspiring there is no question that at least in my mind that had Apollo have been raised by somebody other than his father it's very hard to imagine he would have achieved the success that he has achieved his father's role in his life has just been unbelievable and I think that's a common theme we see in the people who are the greatest one of the things that I didn't really fully appreciate prior to this podcast was how this entire nation of South Korea basically grew to hate him in ways that are almost to describe following a very controversial race in 2002 we go into that in great detail so I'm not gonna go into the whys and the what's now but the story is incredible both how he got to that point of being so despised by an entire nation and also how he basically went into the belly of the lion to confront this head-on and ultimately the the finish to that store is is as remarkable as how he got there Apollo has been known even inside the circles of Olympic athletes as having kind of a surreal approach to training and we're gonna link to some videos including one that is my absolute favorite with some of his training routines but his discipline his work ethic or legendary once that switch was clicked you know he spent the early part of his career basically riding on talent and then just realized nope I'm gonna go all in on this I never want to finish a single race and have a single regret his determination character responds to adversity I mean they really they're certainly inspirational to me and frankly I think this is of all the podcasts I've ever recorded if I was gonna say to my kids I want you to listen to one this is the one I want them to hear at least of all the podcasts I've done so far because this to me is really about grit and I feel very strongly that that's arguably one of the if not the most important one of the most important things we want to be able to instill in our children as a sense of grit so hopefully this will serve to give my kids a lesson on that and potentially for yours as well the parallels between Apollo's life and

[00:03:44] Rocky Balboa are just amazing to me and I can't resist making those comparisons a few times and not withstanding the fact that his name is also Apollo and of course Apollo Creed though spelled with two L's is the fictional character that is is one of the most important antagonists of Rocky Balboa that that's not lost on me but if I were to sum up one rocky ISM that sort of explains

[00:04:08] Apollo's life it's the it's the one where Rocky Balboa in the sixth installment of that movie series is explaining through his son that it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward and obviously I love that as a as a metaphor for life but I think it's illustrated here

[00:04:27] Apolo it's just a great storyteller and he sees a beautiful speaker and I think that's reflected in the fact that this interview goes on for almost four hours it would have easily gone on for six or seven had we not already made commitments to do other things that evening so I hope you find this interview half as interesting as I did I think the shownotes will have some really great stuff in them and there's gonna be links to some really cool videos that we allude to including not just races but some of the other stuff that goes above and beyond that lastly just a couple things on some housekeeping every Sunday I send out a weekly email that has been getting great feedback from the people who subscribe to it so if you don't subscribe to that please do if you end up thinking it sucks you can always unsubscribe from it secondly we've got a team of both Bob

[00:05:11] Kaplan and Travis Jensen who do an incredible job putting together show notes again the feedback we get is there is no podcast out there that puts together show notes the way we do it's basically a full-time job for one person a part-time job for another person and I believe that that shows in the volume of stuff that we're putting out there so if you're enjoying the podcast at least take a look at the show notes because you'll probably find something else that you might have missed or that becomes more clear lastly if you are enjoying this please head over to a podcast reviews give us a review if it's favorable great if it's not please at least be constructive in your criticism so that we can figure out how to make this show even better without further delay here is my guest today Apollo oh hey Apollo thanks for coming down man thanks for having me kind of funny that we're doing this now as opposed to way we were supposed to do the original plan the original plan though as I mentioned is very memorable and I'll never forget it the fact that you know we have a nice dinner we're chatting or getting the rhythm okay know just follow me when I shoot this place it's right on the water we're in Malibu it's perfect it's very quiet guys we have a problem I don't have keys I locked myself out yeah the only saving grace is it could have been a lot worse if I'd killed myself or broken a bone hopping that fence to crawl around the back of the house to try to get in that would have been no you seem pretty athletic so I was like he's okay if you were struggling over the first fence I was like okay may he's got it he's pretty good what was that you held the light for me it was awesome thank you yeah now on lighting and grip yeah I'm the main act here yeah

[00:06:51] I do the fence hopping I do this I do the wall scaling but yeah I need to get rid of that Elmo guy is his lighting skills are just below average bottom of the rung so by the way like all guests who come to my house yet they have to drink topo Chico is that your first topo cheek it was my first it was nice

[00:07:07] I love the glass bottle I love the fact that you love it and you're so passionate when you give it to me it's like you're giving me keys to the house for the weekend it's like tell me how it is after you're finished well I like the fact that only halfway through the first bottle you asked for a second so you've got that other that's nice yeah it's a strangely addictive quality yeah when I first got into it it was out of control hey I was like why am i drinking six of these a day it's to become an expensive habit cuz they're hard to find well man there is so much I want to talk about and I think we'll hopefully be able to get too much of it though probably not all of it just by the nature of the depth we'll probably go into on some stuff but let's for lack of a better plan or strategy let's just go back to the beginning so sure you grew up in the Pacific Northwest yeah I grew up in the Pacific Northwest I was a very high-energy kid one who was mischievous because I think just had tons of energy my father was working most of the time to provide so that you know we didn't struggle too much more than what we already did which I didn't know at the time and you're dead grew up in Japan came to the US so you remember how old he said he's about 17 and a half years old when he came from Japan to I think he landed actually in Oregon originally and he just started his life he didn't speak a word of English he didn't really know anything about the American culture other than what was kind of fed to him when he was in Japan the only focal point he said that he had was it he just needed to get outside of the protocol like lifestyle that was existing within the Japanese culture I think that to him meant going to the place that was a complete 180 and that was the United

[00:08:43] States so he left on his own at seventeen and a half he left on his own against my grandmother and grandfather's wishes who which you know they wanted him to go to school study eventually work for a university and just kind of follow the same path that most I think Japanese follow right this is what you're supposed to do this is what you will do and this is what your life is going to be on a day to day basis and something inside my dad just said I don't want that I don't want that type of future and he came and he risked a lot right he didn't have any money he just had nothing he had a camera in which he sold upon his arrival and that's what he used to begin his life so

[00:09:19] I mean I can't even imagine how difficult that must have been coming to the u.s. not speaking a word of English in a time where Japanese were not exactly the most accepted people in our country and then trying and he used to tell me that he was like oh I was you know I was a I was a bartender I was like how could you be possibly be a bartender if you don't speak English and my dad's like really short too so I can only imagine what that looks like and also the grief that he probably got from all the people who are ordering drinks that he would probably mess up so he said that he liked slam his head against the you know the door like many many many times you trying to figure it out and he did yeah it's not exactly a forgiving crowd right like six drinks in when someone gets their drink screwed up they're less likely to be empathetic yeah to the guy struggling yeah yeah I'm sure it was really challenging but and then my dad like weirdly he said that he was studying I think he was sitting accounting and then someone asked or he was walking by like one of the classes was hosting like a haircutting competition and that's when my dad said oh that looks interesting I couldn't use some extra money let me try that so he ended the competition essentially like got in like third place or something like randomly and then began his career to pursue being a hairstylist which is really really if you knew my dad it makes sense now but even when I hear the story it's just doesn't nothing adds up and he begins his life and he actually was and started a pretty interesting career as a hairstylist and more than a barber I guess you could say and was starting to travel the world had some success and he said that everything was changed obviously when I was born and upon my arrival both my father and my mom I think they were obviously going through some conflicted times and so they divorced my father took full custody of me and Pete didn't know how to raise a child is only how old was your dad do you remember when you were born I don't know because my dad's tell me he's been 35 since I was born so this is yeah which is kind of fun it's a great anti-aging strategy yeah yeah and he looks great too he looks not his age at all so he I can't even like my dad his only context for raising a son was the fact that people would come into a salon and that was his basis for conversation like as your barber or that or your hairstylist like that's your kind of personal psychologist if you've been seeing this person for like 10 plus years so as he's going through this process of raising me he's basically getting all these women who come into a salon like three parental guidance advice on a daily basis and I think he started taking it because that is kind of unusual when a couple splits that their father would take sole control do you know much about that and in terms of has your dad talked to you about because

[00:11:58] I but you know yeah I know you've told me before that you don't really have contact with your mom I mean you in fact you've never had contact with your mom since she left right correct essentially what my dad says is he is I was the better suited to take care of you and I also felt even though I knew nothing about raising you I would do and

[00:12:15] I had the ability to do what it takes to raise you properly at least that's what I thought at least provide some form of kind of security blanket for my own one and only child and that's exactly what he did and so it is interesting I never met my mom even when I have a conversation like with my girlfriend she's like haven't you ever wanted to just meet her and it's really strange when I say it but I never think about it right so I grew up in a single-parent household everyone in my neighborhood pretty much was Singapore household in some capacity or they were raised by their grandmother grandfather I didn't grow up in a bad neighborhood by any means but that just was very normal where I grew up and so to me I never thought about it right and I never understood what that was like having two parents I didn't I didn't know and so my dad did an excellent job obviously raising me but there was never an inclination or I want to actually meet her and I think as I get older there is more questions of I'd like to know from her perspective what happened and you know I think we all have those kind of interesting thoughts and moments where we want to just just divulge and just say like man like I'd like to know my other half right my mom was adopted which I found out much later so her background and ethnicity is also somewhat mysterious which is why my kind of fascination would try to understand my own genealogy and background in historical context have you been able to dig into that through because the problem is if you're using stuff like ancestry you have to sort of have enough information to put in the system yeah yeah exactly this was maybe in 2006 or something I think it was maybe 2005 NBC was doing a show called who do you think you are it might even 2003 I don't remember but

[00:13:54] I remember during that time essentially what they would do is they would ask for permission they would then find out every single thing there is to know about one side of your family so you say okay I wanna know my father or my mom and so I was really interested in my Japanese heritage and so I had asked them to start really diving deep on my my father's side and then they you know they had travel to Japan they started talking to people in Japan and for people who know Japan is such a small but highly protective Society especially when it comes to personal records and they essentially gotten they got zero information and for whatever reason so they're like we know that you have probably some like samurai blood from this yeah some Naga clan in your in your grandmother's side of the family but that's really all we can get out of this thing Wow so I was like kind of disappointed but to go back my relationship with my with my mom was there was none for all you know you could have half siblings of course your mom was presumably quite young when your parents split she could have very easily remarried and yeah and she still keeps in contact I think it's been many years but she was at least until my very first Olympic Games in contact with my father and essentially said and called him after she had heard that I had won my first Olympic gold medal I'm very proud of him I've been following him she lives in the Pacific

[00:15:09] Northwest region so she obviously saw my face on newspapers and on television leading up to the Olympic Games so I think she felt very proud but she did mention one thing to a dad she's like I just I feel this point in the life in both of our lives I don't want to disrupt his path mm-hmm and maybe when he's ready he'll seek me out or something of that nature and so that's kind of always been in the back of my head I also have this like weird protective side of me because I have so much love and respect for my father in everything that he did I don't want him to feel like he was less than if I go out and reach for my mom right no does he thinks I'm good no I don't think so but that was inside me from a long time and so when you're racing about a household I think you're skewed in multiple ways and they create little small micro traumas psychologically that maybe you don't recognize when you're younger or you're missing some elements which makes you more dependent maybe you're more alpha maybe you're less yeah

[00:16:03] I don't know what that is but for sure it definitely I was not the most equilibrium based athlete in the world and I think a lot of athletes are like that right I think there's always something that happens early stage and for me it was always like my father would always teach me that you can always be better you can always be better you can always be better there's always another level to go to perfection is is seemingly unattainable but that's your goal and you don't stop until you get there and that was like so drilled into me psychologically from a young age and it was never like no it wasn't like super Tiger dad although thinking back he was very he did push me extensively and get that feeling when I was a kid but it definitely taught me a lot about like my ultimate goal is to probably make him happy and have respect for what I'm doing and also I want to achieve that perfection and I never did

[00:16:55] I have had races where I would called the perfect race but now when I look back and like I was far from it right but I think that psychology was started from my father and watching him in his work ethic and you know I was always athletic as a kid growing up in Seattle and I had been you know I was a swimmer and I did track a field and I wanted to play football he said no I wanted to box he said no I saw this crazy sport of short-track speedskating and I was actually at the time I was swimming a lot and my father wanted me to go to

[00:17:24] Stanford or Michigan full-ride that was his goal right and we were getting these weird like conversational actual snail mail letters I remember back then basically telling my father if your son continues on this path of excellence in swimming we would love to have a conversation about having him become accepted into this school this was some

[00:17:42] Stanford I forgot what year what was yours broke it was brush stroke and backstroke were my two so I was 1,500 meter breaststroke do you remember what your best hundred us work was I remember but I do remember my 50 meter backstroke I broke like some 20 years state record and one time I remember because the guy who record who I broke at the time he was still like he was excelling and my coach the time bill Christiansen brought me up there and he's like oh you know this is the kid who broke your 20 year record and the guy's like wow well what's interesting is you know usually backstrokers don't make good breaststrokers and vice versa because backstroke and freestyle or long axis strokes breaststroke and fly or short axis strokes in your case though I can see there's an interesting thing which is your legs are so freakishly strong and those are the two leg driven sports those are both what we would call rear-wheel drive sports versus front-wheel drive strokes so it's interesting to think that you would be perfectly suited to do that which means you would have been probably a really good in IM ER as well yeah I was I was decent my hundred-meter item I don't know any my times look we're talking like when I was 12 13 years old right so yeah a lot can happen between that in college but yet still I mean that there was something there I want to go back to something you said a moment ago right which was at a very young age your dad sort of instilled in you this I don't want to put words in your mouth I don't think you said it as the need to be perfect but a quest for perfection you know I talked about this long with my daughter which is this idea of mastery which is that this process of trying to master something that you'll never actually master because that's technically not feasible is the beauty like that's the thing and you know books that have been written about it's usually written about athletes but I think it can apply to musicians or any number of other fields they talk about the the common bond that seems inherent to many of these people who have achieved greatness like you have is this love of practice did you sense that early on did you enjoy the practice or were you more task or goal oriented as far as the outcome early in my career I would say that I wasn't I didn't enjoy the process as much it was based on sheer talent and this is I'm talking from the age of 14 until I was probably about 17 and you started skating at about 30

[00:19:58] I started skating I actually started really really skating at 12 mm-hmm I started really training at the age of 14 so he started swimming what like is at five six year old but I swam locally and you know local competitions and state competitions and then when I saw the sport or track speed skating in 1992 and then in 1994 that's when I said wow this this is an amazing sport

[00:20:18] I used to inline and quad skate like on the side that the nearby local skating rink I feel like I could do that it seems pretty easy it also looks ridiculous right these guys are wearing these when you're like 11 12 years old and you see these guys skate it looks fake and then when my father drove me north to Vancouver BC I saw it live because the Canadians they obviously loved winter sports I was like this is the most incredible sport I've ever seen in my life it doesn't make sense how these human beings can be leaning over these impossible angles on a blade that's one millimeter thick and they're wearing outfits that resemble Superman without the Cape like literally that's alluring and they just have helmets on I was like this is perfect like I have to do this sport right Superman without the gate yeah now that I think about it there's a like why don't they just have the capes on it with you so much yeah yeah that'd be cool actually well I want to come back to the evolution but let's pause for a moment and have you explain the difference between short track long track inline all of these different types of skating sure so inline skating is predominantly done outdoors and they skate and they have competitions all around the world now they have velodrome like competitions but it's in so if you ever seen a velodrome track for track cycling inside of that as a warm-up area that's where inline speed skating competitions are being held in places like Bogota

[00:21:39] Colombia which is by the way Colombia is huge into inline skating I don't know why or how but it's been huge there and so I being growing up in the Pacific Northwest and having rain be a very big part of our culture I did indoor skating so think of your imaginary like roller rink and you have four pylons right in one for each corner and you basically skate around and you're on like a rollerblade but it's got how many wheels per the blue I started out in quad skates so two in the front two in the back okay right and then it's just basically just speed skating so like if you've ever been in a roller rink growing up as an American and it says okay it's time for speed skating and everyone goes out there they play a song

[00:22:16] I mean just get around really fast and they finish right that's literally how I learned and then someone in the local roller rink was like hey you should try out for our two club knows okay that looks that seems fun and my dad at that point was like anything I can do to create more fatigue in this child I'm in

[00:22:31] I just want to get him exhaust as your dad is working non-stop he's working all day long he comes home he's exhausted and I'm like this kid it was just completely berserk out of control like I just I never get tired I could just run and run run run around just an insatiable appetite for everything were you getting into trouble at all absolutely absolutely it was very mischievous and environment has a lot to do with that but for whatever reason I was I excelled pretty early and some gifted programs when I was a child and my dad was very much a a proponent of pushing education and cramming it down my throat and being like look take this test until you pass it basically how did your dad have the time to even over see how you were doing in school and overseeing your you know looking over your shoulder while you're trying to get your homework done like how how did your reflect back on what that even meant I don't think he really could write I think he did what he what he could yeah I most of my childhood was spent my father was not there during the day so I would go to go to school on my own I would come back on my own and until he came home and I couldn't come back from school at 3 p.m. or something like that until 7 8 p.m. sometimes 9 10 p.m. he's not there and I'm alone in the house I had to cook for myself than you're myself 8 9 years old yeah I'm very very young so at a very early age I was very independent

[00:23:51] I'm just relying on myself to kind of succeed I didn't think anything other at the time like I just latch key kid right had no idea but that hates that word saying I'm like that that's pretty much what it was you know there's no way I can remember many many nights it's like dark outside and I'm like where's my dad you know like this is weird but that's that was the reality and and thinking back like my dad he put aside every single want he had in his life everything and it was all about me and for that like I feel obviously eternally grateful but also I learned so much from such a selfless man I get it like I'm his son

[00:24:24] I'm the only son of everything he has everything he wants to do he wants to see me succeed I didn't recognize it when I was that young I do now so every waking moment was like how do I create more experiences for this child how do I take you know my son - we don't have a lot of money so how do I take him to nature and experience things that are free right how do we go out and we can draw we can create something in the sand

[00:24:49] I can go and appreciate the ocean if that takes us a drive I mean we used to drive to all competitions like we would drive from Seattle to Prince George Canada that's a far Drive in the middle of winter to go skate one day competition against Canadian kids who I don't know I'm the only American there and my dad is like basically driving for two days straight with no sleep just so

[00:25:10] I can have that experience when you're that young you don't recognize how much of a sacrifice it's incredible right and then like I think about now I can't even do that now like I'm I feel like vibrant and peaking at this 36 year age right so I just have a tremendous amount respect for my dad in terms of dedication sacrifice just cuz he's is one of the peasant he didn't know what was good what was bad he just tried you everything so going back to the skating so that's what inline is and then talk about the different disciplines of skating on ice yeah so you've got there short-track speedskating and then there's long track speed skating the long track is the one that's been around forever like that's when we go back and see the Olympics 50 years ago correct that was long track correct so long track speed skating is what most people think of as predominantly being on an outdoor ice surface that's a 400 meter oval so imagine you just had a track-and-field track and you basically just you just it froze over during the winter and you poured ice and that's your and you uses an boney that's your track long track speed skating has the 500 meters it has the 1000 meters the 1,500 meter the 5000 and the 10,000 it's sort of parallels running yes distances yes but you also in long track speed skating it's all about time so you've got your own lane no one interferes with you you know you can have some moments where your pair which you're skating with is you know he's in front of you you can basically eat a little bit of draft on the back end of a straightaway but for the most part it's it's you against the clock and there hiding right you can't like as soon as you stop skating you kind of immediately sort of slow down really accepting me like some gliding but the most part like time trialing just like be on a bike there's no hiding this on cheating and when I first started I actually started out how I started out doing long track as a proponent because that's what everyone does in Calgary and in other parts of Butte Montana I would skate so that's long track speed skating this skate itself used to be a fixed boot and a fixed blade meaning there's imagine a shoe and then on your heel and then again on your calendar on the ball with a ball your foot are these two cups that basically just they just lock into the bottom of the shoe and then on the bottom that is the skate and how long is the blade the blades about 17 to 18 inches long it's again it's only about a millimeter thick a little bit thinner than a short track blade the actual bend and rocker of this skate is different but it's a relatively flat blade correct it's very flat I used to play hockey growing up but I was a goalie and goalies have a much longer flatter skate than the skaters the skaters have a very rounded blade and so when your goalie you have all of this equipment on so you're relatively slow but in a straightaway a goalie even with all those equipment can generally skate pretty fast even relative to the regular skater just because you have more blade on the ice so I'm assuming I don't know how many inches it is but it's obviously much shorter than what you're describing so when you have what 17 18 inches of surface on that ice that's a that's a ton of contact right a ton of contact but it's it's only in between the two cups at any moment and even shorter actually of the time of which your your blade is touching the ice we can get into those details in differently but that's long track speed skating they then evolved to a clap skate which means that the rear heel of the blade was in touch with ya and detaches so that when you push the blade actually still stays on the ice as the heel comes off so you get like a 5 to 15 percent additional advantage every single time you push and

[00:28:34] I was I watched that phenomenon come on come with you an impact did that have on times it changed everything it changed who was good it changed who wasn't good at change which countries were really strong for a period of time because people couldn't understand how to skate in a clap skate mechanism because the technique is so much different and it really became a lot to do with the type of equipment that you had and your ability as an athlete to transfer your power through the clap skate mechanism you could be the world's greatest on a fixed skate mechanism go to the clap skate and not even make the top 20 so it was a really difficult learning curve for a lot of athletes and a lot of people started just to just basically give up and they just they just dropped out what year did that transition take place this was 1995 when we really start to see it 95 96 and 97 was when that was the peak years of the clap skate what drove that technological change was there some whispering that oh this is politically motivated to change the power structure within this forward and because which country's prior to the 90s were the most dominant in long track I would say with the exception of the Americans right it's always been the Europeans were always the best a couple of Japanese but for the most part it was always the

[00:29:47] Europeans meaning the Netherlands some of the Germans and some of the Russians though Eric Hyden in 1980 has anyone ever matched that feat no one has ever matched that I don't think anyone ever will match that feet and that feat again was he won five gold he won the five heard the thousand he went all the distances in one Olympic Games which is it would be like Hussein yes there's no there's no way to explain that I mean I lost this thing to that that I would see in recent times as

[00:30:15] Katie ledecky winning the 200 the 400 the 800 in the Olympics if there were a 1500 which there is in the world's but not in the Olympics don't get me started on that she would have won that as well right but you're right I mean it's sort of like Prefontaine at one point holding the American record in everything from I think the you know 1500 to the 10k then of course to win the gold in all of those is Americ was a specimen he was a very special genetic human being it is aside from that his work ethic was astronomically high and he was a completes this guy was a savage when it came to training he would bury and still does by the way bury most people on a bike and he doesn't train anymore he's just his ability to taller a pain and threshold and lactic acid is like when I like when you watch a racehorse and that racehorse is obviously in pain but doesn't slow down it's very similar and when I was growing up Eric Hyden was the king and it to be honest with you he's to me he's still the king I tell him he's still a king because what he did was so ridiculously difficult and my sport of short-track speedskating by the way is very different than long track yeah I want to come to that but before we leave Eric

[00:31:31] Heiden I mean one I know we've talked a little bit about some of his training I want to hear more about that later on but my one connection to him is of course he went to med school at Stanford which is where I went and when I was in med school you know I used to ride my bike a lot and there's this very famous

[00:31:44] Hill near Stanford called old la Honda which is sort of the benchmark Hill for cyclists and anyone listening to this who rides a bicycle in the Bay Area knows old la Honda and not only knows it knows their time up it because that is the metric that is the equalizer it's about three and a half three point six miles it's got a number of switchbacks it's relatively steep I feel like it's almost seven percent grade on average and I believe the benchmark time is about 20 minutes so if you're below 20 minutes you're allowed to call yourself a cyclist if your takes more than 20 minutes you know you ride a bike so it took me a while to break 20 minutes my roommate in medical school name's matt mcCormick he was about 17 minutes 20 seconds which was exceptional he was certainly the fastest of any of the people that you know I knew on a bike

[00:32:33] Eric Heiden apparently was about 14 and a half minutes up old la Honda which was and remains to my knowledge the record up that hill and I used to I had a model that I built that would calculate how many watts you needed to average to go up that hill and I forgot I don't think I've ever plugged Eric's time into it but it wouldn't surprise me if that were a 600 watt effort given his body weight he's a big guy eric is very big and heavy quad dominant athlete so I mean I should go back and do that but I think for someone Eric's weight to have gone up that in 14 and a half minutes it's hard for me to imagine he could have done that at less than 600 watts which anybody who's ever stepped foot on any sort of ergometer knows that like anybody can hold 600 watts for 10 seconds most people can't do it for a minute and very few people can hold 600 watts for a minute to hold it for 14 and a half there's so much power and then of course he became a professional cyclist right any I think he rode in a couple of tours yeah yeah any time he wrote for 7/11 and yeah and he's he's an orthopedic surgeon now and

[00:33:36] I've never met him or know him at all but it's hard for people who don't follow that sport myself included to really reflect on what it would mean to be the best in the world at such a broad range of distances because those are physiologically completely different events I mean the 500 and the 10,000 have nothing in common really no they're completely different energy systems they're different technique different energy system different I didn't even realize that so did of course that make sense different technique right it's the difference between someone running 200 meters versus someone running 5ks different equipment involved

[00:34:08] I mean it's there's so many things that are so and in the 80s I think sports science was especially in speed skating was never a huge part of what we did like track and field and like cycling which are in my opinion at the absolute pinnacle of pushing that that red line right of utilizing science and what we understand of the sport speed skating is a very unconventional it's a uncomfortable position to be in it's not natural to speed skate being in that position especially is a long track speed skater so you know to train for that what is and it still is really really excruciating and there is no balance right we only turn left so you know there's lots of imbalances aside from from physical being and but Eric was a huge part of that motivation to train like an animal as was Lance and a lot of the other guys who least I looked up to as being superhuman not only for their accomplishments but the way that they mentally attacked pain and training because that that's where you win your your actual wars in the training part when you get to the competition you can't do anything so if you didn't show up ready you can't hide that you know in my cell you can only lose it by showing up with in the wrong headspace but the right headspace won't win it if you your likelihood of doing very well is dramatically much higher if you pair and

[00:35:34] I think that goes with pretty much anything so I I was really interested in that psychology of what makes up someone like that so I you know what the Eric Hyden and many other athletes who train to the same tutelage of his original coaches and I believe her name was Diana Holum she was based in Milwaukee in the

[00:35:54] Madison region of the Midwest and her training methods were very unconventional and they were obscene and they probably would be deemed very you know almost punished they're on par with waterboarding today it's like yeah like not allowed to do that training yeah okay Eric here's we're gonna do since you're you know and by the way like we had a hundred athletes to start only twelve remain that's our team now we start training together so you can imagine as the other 88 got broken yeah broken very early or they just didn't have the you know the ability to recover based on peer genetics at this time and that's how we train back then and watching and hearing these stories about

[00:36:32] Eric going up the Lake Placid ski hill with a large rope tied around him and that is tied to a tractor-trailer truck tire right and he's just doing hill sprints up and down for like three hours and he just he was he just did crazy stuff like Rocky style training and that mentality like I mean for me as an athlete sports science is amazing and I wish I concentrated more on it but that psychology was what I was actually really really really interested in that's what I loved I love to do stuff that people thought was completely obscene and crazy and you know like for me like I would say 80% of my career all my races were one ever before I got to the start line the other competitors were racing for a second and they just they just knew that I was like just completely off my rocker I was not in the same head space as em I was different I didn't talk to anybody I was and I wanted to create that kind of bubble right and I got that from these kind of legends who I looked up to there's a video that will definitely make sure we link to this I have a feeling this podcast will have more links to videos than most of ours but there's a video that I remember seeing there's like pretty sick seven minutes long and it had some snippets or highlights of some of your training and actually was discussing it with Lance Armstrong once we were having dinner and I was like dude you got to see this video of what Apollo is doing and you were doing

[00:37:55] I think single leg lateral jumps of two steps at a time yeah yeah most likely I feel like I've done some crazy things in my day I just don't think I have the explosiveness single leg that's the thing most people don't appreciate how much of a reduction you have in power when you go from two to one leg right it's not half the power you're losing way more than half when you take that second leg away and then adding to it that you're doing it will hat orally yeah like it's and and I remember in the video it says yeah this is basically a 48 minute set yeah that was probably following like a nice session yes alright session that's what you do those I mean how often to someone get injured doing that because the thing that struck me is like look you can be the best stud in the world you can have the toughest head in the world but at some level your ankles gonna catch on that stair and you're gonna fall over a ladder like you're always just one millimeter away from breaking your ankle you're looking at me like no that would never happen never saw it never thought about it definitely the risk is there but then he

[00:38:56] I mean then again you know in short track speed skating I mean we skate together every day sometimes twice a day for four to six hours a day and we're inches from each other and that blade is literally this close to my face now this blade gets this close to my face it's just for reference that's like like that's 12 inches from your face is where you're putting on blade every day every crossover every lap is that why you have such a smooth shave the sport was very dangerous and I used to do really dumb stuff like we would have at one point in the is you the

[00:39:31] International Skating Union implemented a rule that had to have you had to have a neck guard to protect your neck and all major arteries on the body needed to be covered with a cut proof material like Kevlar and so everyone was wearing these cut proof material inside of the skin suit so is basically sewn into the skin suit the racing suit and I hated the feeling of the Kevlar didn't stretch

[00:39:56] I used to cut mine out so I would Ray is a completely legal right but I used to cut mine out and I used to race we call it racing naked right so you'd race naked so if I fall with another skater the likely the boys hot is like 80% when I and you're done like that's one time you're done but you know when you're young and you're dumb

[00:40:13] I did many many dumb things like that but now they actually check before you get on the ice you know they see if you've altered this consume so what year was short track a demonstration sport was it 90 to 88 in comedy eight okay and so what was the impetus for creating this new sport you know I'm not sure because the sport actually has been around for a long time and people used to do short track speed skating outdoor in New York City I think in the 60s I see so it's just one of those things where the sport had been around forever and it was like now we're just gonna bring it to the Olympic level yeah and it was you go from long track speed skating which is all about time it's imagine like you're watching a track-and-field race but no one can ever go outside their lane you know and we see that no hundred meters but imagine like a mile you can't move these is the lane you're given and there's only two people on the track of the time and everyone was basically just as time trials so that was like not that interesting to me and also I just like the fact that racing was so much more it was just more intimate right and it was psychologically a huge part of what I wanted to race against other athletes and out smart or out strategize them and

[00:41:16] I liked that moment of risk and so short-track speedskating is very different than long track speed skating so you go from a 400 meter oval outdoor to and long track is also indoor but to a Olympic sized hockey rink and the track is a hundred and eleven meters around at the inside at the tightest perimeter right that's the actual track size and you've got instead of just two people on the track at a time going for against the clock you've got five to six sometimes seven to eight skaters on the start line at once all racing and jockeying for position and drafting each other and passing on the inside and outside and grabbing each other bumping making mistakes and you know leaning over these angles because it's such a tightly held oval inside our skates are set up differently we don't have a clap skate it's a fixed skate we tried using clap skates in 1997 in 1998 but it just it was the sport is too dynamic and there's too much weight transfer from the from the ball of the foot to the heel the foot wear you know sometimes I would lean so far forward on the ball of my foot when I'm coming out of a corner my he would lift off using a clap skate and so it was just very very dangerous you couldn't you couldn't use that now I mean so truck speed skating is one that the blades are so offset so imagine this is my my skate instead of having the blade right in the middle the blade is actually way over here on the on the left side on both because there's always going left because you're always going left and you're leaning over so much at these angles that you need to have that additional offset to make sure that you can you know still have enough pressure on that leg and also be able to maneuver it properly so wow I never even realized that in watching that that your blades were not symmetric on the bottom of the boot so then I'm is straight they're actually even sometimes tilted depending on what you like as a skater and your technique you as the skater have some say in that degree of tilt you have all the say-so your control over your equipment is the one thing that is a huge part of short-track speedskating that if you don't show jack speed skate which I'm assuming no one on this listening to the podcast does it's such a huge part of the sport it would be the difference between me feeling like I could never lose and me feeling like I'm not gonna make it into the quarter-final like if my equipment feels that far off it just feels you just feel like you lost all your power maybe I can use an example so imagine you're a boxer and you've got boxing gloves that way you know two pounds each and then imagine the next time you put the box and clothes on then out ten pounds each that's that's what it feels like how much difference it feels like as an athlete when your equipment isn't is not dialed in or and then small things like the ice temperature the grip of the ice meaning like your perfect body weight and the amount of power that you typically generate in the corner and they wet the ice don't they to give you guys more grip yeah so the angles you're at are ridiculously poor actually hot water in the corners of both sides of the track and we actually were actually skating on top of the water we're actually not digging the ice if you saw what's giving you the grip if you're not gigging digging into the ice you technically are but most of the time you're on top of the water so the grip is a combination of both the the way that our blades are said there's such a hardcore and in the blade that when you lean over on that one point one millimeter piece of metal the blade will flex to a certain degree and and some of that Bend comes out and what's remaining is still a curve that allows you to hook yourself around that corner oh I see Wow so if you laid that blade in its maximally flexed position on a flat surface from end to end could you put like a dime underneath it does it have that much

[00:44:50] Bend or curvature in it not a diamond you can see it's like if I had my blade here I should have brought my skate and I didn't put any pressure on the blade and I just later no no no the only ends of the blade will be touching the middle part in between the two cups which I mentioned which was all in the heel that whole area doesn't touch the ice until I put a lot of pressure and then the ends no longer touch in the middle touches so we Bend our own skates we rock or our own skates it's very you know it's very technical we use a radius machine which measures one one thousandth of a hair in between these two areas which is about I think it's about like 4 1/2 inches across the blade and we mark it and so you're born in what 80 80 to 82 so when you're 10 years old this is a demonstration sport in the Olympics so by the time you're 13 it's about ready to become a full-fledged Olympic sport and it's sort of its in the crosshairs now for you which is it's a sport that you're passionate about your dad's like fine let's let him do this because it's better than him getting a concussion every day when you started I'm just guessing you were quite naturally talented to begin with because you alluded to it earlier that you didn't really start training until you were 14 so there was this year when you were just getting by on talent yeah actually further than that so you know from 12 till 14 my father took me around to small local speed skating competitions and I was winning most of them even the ones internationally which I say internationally I mean just going to

[00:46:17] Canada and I wasn't getting any competition in the States I was getting all of my challenge from racing against other athletes inside Canada and I had beaten pretty much anyone west of Toronto and now it was a time where the only remaining place for me to compete in Canada was Montreal because that's where the real skaters came out of I see so it's the it was

[00:46:39] Montreal not Vancouver that had the epicenter of skating yes and like Fredericton and a few other places Quebec in Quebec City was a big producer of great Canadian short track speed skaters something about Quebec growing up I was really serious in martial arts and boxing and yeah like the national championships were always in Quebec or Ottawa like someplace close to him back and the Nationals was the only time you would face these guys yeah they were like a different breed man they're different breed they were really really tough dude yeah they're tough guys yeah and I had lot of respect for them the Canadians to me were always very very strong in the sport and they still are today you know short-track speedskating is not like cycling we've you've got all these different athletes from all these different countries all over the world at the time there was only a few really really strong countries and short-track speedskating the US was not one of them by the way so so after so in 92 in the demonstration year that's sort of the moment when it I guess presumably after 92 people say well okay we're gonna take this sport seriously now the countries are deciding how much do we want to invest in this in terms of our athletic programs correct did the United States at that moment did they do well enough in the demonstration games to decide let's put some resources into this we did okay we weren't definitely weren't dominant and we weren't on the podium I mean on the women's side

[00:48:00] Cathy Turner had won a gold in 92 and again in 94 other than that there was no real funding mechanism we were there but you know at the time people were training in the U P they were training in Marquette Michigan now were you thinking because now by the time you get into the sport it's 94 mm-hmm which means there was another Olympic year because that was the 94 was the year summer and winter offset if I recall right that was the whole Nancy Kerrigan the Italia Harding year wasn't it that makes me feel old because I remember that like it was yesterday were you thinking I want to go to the Olympics or were you just thinking no I just want to keep you know sort of beating whoever

[00:48:35] I'm skating against and I'm gonna still be a swimmer I knew that I didn't want to swim yes around that there on that time of your kissing Stanford and Michigan goodbye I knew at that time that those were not in my path looking back I'm very interesting and I'm pretty sure I would have not gotten a full ride to Stanford if I had pursued and maybe I would have but I you know obviously I didn't so you know at the age of fourteen I was winning quite a bit of competitions locally in domestically in the United States and I was essentially being scouted by a few of these junior development program coaches who at the time that junior development program was in Lake Placid

[00:49:13] New York the same place where the 1980 games were were hidin won his you know amazing five medals and the Miracle on Ice from the US beat the Soviets in the semi-final then went on and won the gold but that's where I was gonna have to move to and these coaches Patrick went on at the time came to my father and said we we actually have a lot of interest in bringing your son early you have to be fifteen years old to be admitted into this program I was only fourteen and was this a summer only program or is this and I gotta get where you'd actually go to school it's a real

[00:49:43] Academy like you you actually literally move there you go to school there and you train to be hopefully the next stage would then go to the national team and train to go be part of the Olympic program okay I don't know what any of this stuff meant right so they approached your dad approached my father they approached me I wouldn't even know what that I was like okay that sounds not fun you know all the others have a country like I want to stay in Seattle we've got you know very few sunshine days a year it's the summertime like I don't want to go there this was 1997 the summer of 1986 and they essentially said you know we we want Apollo to come and what do you think and my father was like absolutely

[00:50:19] I gotta get this kid focused on something you know I kind of alluded before that I was pretty much devious as a kid I had difficulty concentrating and staying on task to one specific thing and are you one of those kids that today would automatically get this label of this for sure I'm sure I would have been loaded up on Ritalin all day were all kind of stuff right so which my dad was always he didn't wouldn't care if I even got that diagnostic he would never allow that for some reason my dad's been like 20 years ahead of the game in terms of nutrition I don't know where he learns this stuff but anyway a different topic he's got good lineage right I mean if you you know just just follow the okinawa and you're pretty much gonna be okay yeah yeah yeah dysentery ins my father then approached me and I remember this very clearly he's like look you've got this incredible opportunity to train in

[00:51:02] Lake Placid New York you potentially could go on to be a part of the Olympic team which would mean that you would make the 1998 Olympic team in Nagano Japan and compete your grandfather is still alive I'm from Japan this is your heritage you had this is this an incredible opportunity wait was that a real possibility that was because you would have only been 16 right I would have only been 15 15 in that for those Olympic Games correct I mean for a men's sport to go to the

[00:51:33] Olympics at 15 is almost unheard of it's not unheard of for women but for men that's really yes that's amazing that they thought that that was a chance right yeah so that was that was the end like Michael Phelps went to his first Olympics at 15 what most people don't realize is he was fifth in the 200 fly was the only of any one four which was still unbelievable it's hard to believe that a 15 year old boy could have gone to the Olympics and placed fifth in the world at arguably the second most grueling race and swimming if not the most grueling race and swimming he went on to break his first world record before his 16th birthday if my memory serves me correctly making him the youngest male athlete to ever have a world record in a time sport yeah Michael is not human I'm the Michael for years he's not human doesn't matter what he says any trains they gonna need a monster but he also was just not he is put on earth to be in that water I think he told me one time because I'm more comfortable in the water damn my bed it's more comfortable for me to be I guess there's like a sense of weightlessness right you know but that's amazing well actually you and

[00:52:36] Michael have something in common which is you are both the most decorated Olympian in the United States in the summer and winter games Michael of course also being the most decorated Olympian ever but I don't think any US Olympian is more decorated in the Winter Games than you are they it's arguable and subjective right I I had an amazing career and I was very blessed to be and when one that many medals but I also had the opportunity to win a lot of medals too right so look I grew up in the

[00:53:00] Olympic Training Center with these wrestlers they only have chance to win one right all right yeah no if certain sports are amenable to any more medals that title is me has been kind of tasked over and over again and I smile when I hear because it's amazing right but I still look at Eric hi Bonnie Blair and they're very good friends of mine and I still consider them to be like you know really on top of the podium so okay so it's summer of 96 you're basically being brought in 18 months before what could be your first

[00:53:28] Olympics correct so it is it is the summer of 96 opportunity to move to be part of the junior development program my father says you got to do this I met a mischievious age I didn't recognize my own Talent he says yes I say no he says red I say black like I'm always the complete opposite of what my father is saying and so you know he essentially perhaps packed my bags tries to explain to me the incredible importance of what I'm about to embark upon and then drives me to SeaTac

[00:54:01] Airport drops me off waves goodbye and then I wave goodbye I had a plan in my head already what I was going to do next and I walked right to the payphone which we used pay phones back then 96 but put a quarter in it yeah exactly and I called my friend I said I'm supposed to go to New York today but I'm not come pick me up from the airport and then for the next like I would say eight days I was bouncing around from like well like they're almost like 11 days actually bouncing around from house to house all while my father believes that I'm still in Lake Placid but I'm so angry I never called him and he hadn't got a call from them what did the coaches do when you show up so the coaches called him eventually I think this is probably like on day six or something like that right okay mr. Ono you know very curious the offer is still wide open we just ever heard from you do you have plans I'm still attending and my dad oh my god you lost my son and you know all these things and he figures out somehow which house I was at picks me up he's very angry obviously because essentially I was running away as a kid and you know my dad he's got this like sense of wisdom and he's noticing these like small little habits that I had been doing as a child that he really really try to Train out of me and he thought that by placing mean this kind of single discipline sport of going in circles would do a lot psychologically from a beneficial perspective I didn't know anything about that time all I knew is I didn't want to go why do you think you didn't want to go I mean you had been successful yeah do you think on some level you were afraid of going and finding out you might not be as good as you thought you could be I don't even think it was I don't even think I got that deep I think it was just I just didn't literally didn't want to go I wanted to hang out with my friends in the Seattle area and it was that it was that simple and also stupid that I was gonna be throwing away potentially because I could have very easily just said no I'm not gonna do this thing and done it again right and just never went to New York and then we would never be sitting here talking about this so Incred again my father who the second time he comes and takes me the airport gets in the plane and we're the second time meaning it's still the summer 96 it's just two weeks later so first of all I mean that's pretty interesting that the coaches there didn't say well forget this kid like he just failed the test right like the test was do you have the mental fortitude to even show up one day one coaches were like we have to have this kid this kid is he is gonna make us beats getting like amazing those are not my words these are things that are trying to tell my dad which he tried to kind of tell me to me but you know when you're 14 and you don't agree with anything your father says it doesn't make any sense and so again this time he accompanies you there oh he makes sure so he flies to I'll be in New York we take the drive at Lake Placid he gets out of a car he shakes Patrick Whelan's hands as good luck and he walks and goes home you know and Patrick runs like whole like I get this this Calvin and Hobbes character in my life I don't need this kind of heat and but Patrick actually turned out to be an incredible coach and mentor and guy at first night

[00:57:01] I was just so awkward and weird I mean you're I mean I'm a 14 year old kid I'm living now in a dormitory I've got roommates from parts of the country I um I've never heard of a recognized and they're all short track skaters or it's short long means they're both okay in the in the Junior Olympic program and then Lake Placid Olympic

[00:57:21] Training Center you've got lose you've got bobsled you've got cross-country you've got the ski jumping guys you've got long and short track speed skating and you've got all the by athletes and you've got everyone there from the winter regions because Lake Placid is very cold in the winter mmm and so I I'm a complete fish out of water I look different I talk different we're different types of clothes I listen different types of music I can't relate to anybody and I feel I hated there the first seven days I remember this very viscerally I really really everyday would call my dad like I hate it this this place is not for me and my dad's like just you got to give it 30 days you have to be there for a month just give it time get high man and prior to going had you done much in the way of off ice training like you know you and I have talked and we're gonna talk later today about some of your legendary workouts in the weight room had you discovered that yet or were not you not mostly an on ice guy and we're not doing a lot of dry land I mean my dad would take me when I was a a quad an inline skater my dad would wake me up really really early in the morning before he went to work and he would make me go to the park and skate so the tiger dad or whatever he wanted that was very much and I hated it by the way it was horrible they would I hate it so much

[00:58:35] I told me that I want to quit one time because I he was oh you want to quit okay tell me that you really really want to quit okay and for him it was never about me actually becoming the best I don't think that actually was ever part of his goal and life plan his plan was to instill these mental strengths within me that never allowed me to quit what I was doing to develop the capacity to understand what it was like to truly leave no stones unturned during the preparation it's a very Japanese in his in his way right like okay you want to do this one thing then everything you do is dedicated towards being incredible and you know the thing about this the

[00:59:11] Japanese sushi masters right they have seven years before they're ever allowed to touch the fish they're just making rice every day do that would blow my brains out month two like I could not deal with that right you're telling me I'm an amazing sushi like what happens if you're just really really good and you're talented nope there's you can't break the rules it's gonna take you seven years of touching this rice and making it perfect before you're allowed to touch the fish so like that kind of mentality of like this ever going method of trying to become perfect and my dad left Japan so he didn't want to do that but I think he couldn't help himself that's just a part of well I mean my guess is he realized that maybe at its most extreme and it wasn't what was right for him but I suspect he realized that there were elements of that they were beautiful that were important and that he was succeeding as a result of I suspect he wanted you to have some elements of that discipline and that again passion might be overly simplistic but the ability to stay on that thread and master something which is interesting right because look like all parents he wanted the best for you he at this point you know you're 14 I even maybe he couldn't have imagined you'd go on to be what you did but it was like look this kid's gonna go to college and whatever he's learning here this grit will translate over to that next phase of his life and maybe he didn't really know when had a master plan I think he did did I think he'll tell you that he did but it wasn't exactly graphed out like he you know this is the recipe for having success and being a successful father which I consider my father to be but it was it was it was tough right I mean you imagine I'm really really really young and I'm being forced at waking up but like 6:00 or 5:00 in the morning to go skate outside in a that's right you're if I'm doing the math right you're 14 you're a year younger than the normal entry to this program right yeah yep that started and when we when I arrived in Lake Placid and I was going to the process of understanding like if I even like this sport like I'm probably like in week number two or three I sort of recognized like wow this is I feel a lot of freedom here I don't my dad's not here the only kind of authority figure I have is my coach who is really really easy but also I respect because he's figured out a way to talk to me in a way that speaks to me is he kind of your first real coach first real coach so all of the the previous year and a half or two years you were my dad who obviously you know despite his greatness doesn't really know much about speed skating he knows nothing about speed skating so you just sort of like you're just going out to the track and just you don't have a strategy you're just trying to win yeah

[01:01:51] I mean every time I would skate back then it was Cheerilee based on talent nothing more I didn't train in other words off the line you're going for broke every time you're not trying to be tactical and outsmart somebody necessary basically yeah and you know arguably I was just better than most of those kids they didn't in my eyes they didn't know how to speed skate very well so now you got this coach and presumably he's looking at you being like we got to break some habits here yeah so we do the body composition test first and I'm like obviously the highest my nickname was chunky as a kid and you know I was eating everything in sight we had cafeterias just let's put this in perspective there is no way you were a chunky I was junky what was your what was your body fat on that first test I don't remember the body fed but he was the highest and there was some chubby kids in my in our program there were some chubby kids I mean look I'm 14 years old though I don't know how how lean there I wasn't me coming out there looking like you know hey I'll shred it but I was the highest by far did you always kind of have that physique of just heavy northerners yeah enormous quads enormous enormous but I was just a thicker kid and partially because I just was eating everything and I was going through puberty and everything was tasty and I would just eat it had no understanding at any capacity of nutrition and that what it right which is so funny knowing you now right like you're you're so dialed on everything yeah I try to be much more specific in terms of how you live your life and anyway but back then it also didn't really matter and thinking back so I you know I got these tests back and I'm deeply embarrassed to be you know the most chubby kid out there and I I remember the coach telling me one time like what do you want to do like what are your goals for this year coal's what do you mean my goals this year I couldn't even think about the next six months let alone the World Team

[01:03:35] Trials in eight months from now like I had no idea what that meant and then so I started to understand that I actually liked speed skating I liked being out there in the ice I like the feeling and member one time I because I was so embarrassed by that back to just one sort of technical issue but the sport short track has how many distances it's the five hundred the thousand five hundred thousand and fifteen hundred fifteen hundred and then we have a relay and across those three distances had you exhibited proficiency equally or were you more geared towards one or the other at that age I was stronger in the 1500 meters okay that was more I would say we would call it an endurance athlete so two and a half minutes on the ice at a time separated by 20 minute breaks and then you know you race basically every 20 minutes Jesus that is Phelps Ian yeah it's that's there were races I think in the Olympics where Michael would have what 17 minutes between a heat and a final or something which and it just seems impossible to imagine yeah your recovery has to be very high and that's why most athletes and short-track speedskating even to this day they trained for all the distances they trained for the 500 which is the pure sprint 40 seconds they trained for the 50 nanometers which is two and a half minutes and they even trained for the the 3,000 meters which is only held with the world championships which is like you know four and a half minutes so going back to my story I was so embarrassed by this body composition test that I sat down with Petra Quentin's and I asked him is it possible that I can become too good too early and he's looking at me I haven't been looking at me like what the hell is this kid talking about them know that that's why you're here right and he's like no and I was like what happens if he burnout he's like you only burn out if you don't like the sport anymore if we train you too hard like and it's not gonna be the ladder so as long as you continue like this you're gonna be you're gonna do great you just you gotta focus and that began my kind of understanding of if I really concentrate on this and I really care about the outcome I was able to achieve really really interesting results and I went to the Junior trials which means you make the Junior World Team and I was supposed to make that team and I didn't

[01:05:38] I got third so it's like swimming where the top to make it correct okay and I remember going back home and being so pissed that I didn't make that team that I just started actually really attacking the weight room was that kind of your first big loss was that the first time you were surprised at an outcome was the first time the in short-track speedskating that I was supposed to make a team but I didn't and I remember that feeling was just it was so itchy it's like the itch that you can't scratch and it's there every day every second of the hour do you remember that race what happened you may see some multi different distances but it just it was a combination of I wasn't good enough and

[01:06:12] I wasn't racing properly I shouldn't have made that team but you sort of reached your limit of natural talent at that age yeah but that was a time where if I wanted to make significant changes and had to really concentrate both technically and also on the physiology of training to be a short track athlete and I started attack in the weight room and that's the only way that I knew how to exert like this you know I'm this I'm going through puberty as a kid I've got all this testosterone I'm genetically gifted for the sport I just have to put it to work and so that was the one major differences I just remembered just basically putting more plates on the squat rack at the age of 14 and it was very easy and I noticed like I remember like a week would go by and my like strength would increase by 30% like it was like just compounding boom boom every single week I was getting stronger and stronger stronger and when I arrived in the World Team Trials in 96 to make the 1987 World Team I had to ended up actually winning the competition which in for you know the viewers who don't understand that's like I was 14 years old racing against guys who were grown men yes oh this isn't junior world this is the team to go to the worlds represent the US this is I mean again for most people who don't follow Olympic sports outside of Olympic years you know you sort of have an Olympics three out of four years as you've got the Olympics or worlds you actually compete every single year yeah exactly so you got World Cups we've got World

[01:07:35] Championships and that's what we're doing you know everything we're not working in like Home Depot and just like having fun so you made the team for this is 97 I need to go to the world so this is the team this is now means you're an odds-on favorite to go to the Olympics in 98 absolutely I mean I dominated those trials what did you do with the worlds that year I think I got 19th in the world I think and I remembered that

[01:07:58] I had never skated against the Chinese or the Korean I only stayed against Canadians and Americans at the time so you hadn't even skate against Europeans I see it again to no one other than those two countries and you know when you talk about Canadians I price skating against really only like ten guys from

[01:08:12] Canada who were some I semi competitive with me so when I went to the World Championships the first thing I noticed was the track pattern in which these athletes were skating were so vastly different and that's when this light bulb came I head and I was like oh my god the US is so far behind we are skating the wrong way everyone is basically when they exit the corner they're hugging the you know the blocks and they're basically creating the smallest distance possible to protect their inside lane in position and I was way out by the board's so you're taking a faster turn but going a greater distance right you're basically creating more pressure on your legs but you're being more protected so it's also

[01:08:49] I didn't notice the strategy was so much more important in international competitions and I felt like we were skating to different races and you know I perform you know pretty poorly because it's my first World Championships but that's when I saw like this is the big leagues these are the guys who are really training to win medals these are the Koreans these are the Chinese these are the Canadians this is the real national teams these get this all they care about this all they do on a day-to-day basis and it was a huge difference between racing domestically at the world Trials level in the u.s. versus Internet once you actually go and that's when I was like wow I have to if

[01:09:24] I want to remain competitive like it felt so I felt so far away at that time were you discouraged I mean it sounds like a silly question to be 19th but did you actually expect to go there and win or did you expect to do better than 19 I didn't have any expectations to be honest with you I didn't know what to expect what I did understand was you know again this is 97 so this pre

[01:09:44] Olympic year which means we were having the World Championships in Nagano Japan because they usually want to have a test event to make sure the venue works properly so you can imagine all of the Japanese that are there right my father's there my my grandparents are there I mean it's a full arena with 20,000 people in that arena I'm 14 years old I've never skated in front of more than like a thousand people in my life let alone this many people and I just number the Roar was so deafening and I just was like this is this is this feeling is so addictive and looking at like all the other athletes and they're like colorful skin suits and the Koreans and they skated so differently than we did the Chinese had their own style of skating the Canadians the Italians and I was like man this is like this is crazy like this is I can't believe it I'm here and I finish that competition I very much realized and recognized that the

[01:10:34] Koreans in my view were significantly better than everyone else technically the way they raced the way that they carried themselves on and off the ice was very very unique at the time and you know I came home from those World Championships with an incredible experience I mean mentally and psychologically and then unfortunately instead of spending this is 97 this summer so I'm going into my trials for the Olympics are gonna be in

[01:11:01] February of 98 okay I come home in March of 97 so you've got basically eight months till the trials so I've got three and a half to four months until I go back into the national team program now before I was in the Junior team program training Lake Placid we now I would be relocated to Colorado Springs the official Olympic training center of the

[01:11:19] United States and this is where all of the guys who I just beaten you know a month before this is where everyone's gonna be housed and trained 80 percent of the guys some guys had their own personal coaches in Saratoga Springs and other areas but most of the team was training in one location and you know if you have 12 people they're only five or selected to the team one is an alternate for skate the relay the top two from each distance skate individually the games with an opportunity to win a medal none of this makes any sense to me still okay even though I had just won and even though I had done very very well I come back from that competition and I go back to Seattle instead of training my food choices were like basically taco bell/pizza and zero zero athletic activity I'm talking about why

[01:12:06] I don't think that I truly understood the importance of the off ice training mechanism and offseason training I thought this was the break that you're supposed to take and my dad's like I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be working out I said nah whatever I just you know tell him I did and I did I didn't and I fell back in the same negative habit of hanging out the same kind of crowd and individuals who that's what my dad wanted me to get away from and now that I was doing it I'm getting older I'm more crafty you know I've got experiences in my belt and I'm just doing it on my own and finally when I get back to Colorado

[01:12:40] Springs you know I and you head back at the end of the summer the beginning of this summer now this is the end of the summer and this is summer 98 so you're like four months from trials more like me make five and a half months from trials and so now I'm in a position where I've gained like all this I think

[01:12:56] I gained like 20 pounds or something crazy from when they saw me the last time we can imagine right I'm still going through puberty I'm still kind of maturing zero training eating complete garbage food and my physique totally changed I got you show up with like Spacey these two spare tires around my butt my body you know and a member hearing when we're doing body composition we ought to take our shirts off and do this test I remember some of the other athletes going holy like what the hell's that kid doing everyone's been busting their ass in the offseason because they've all recognized the importance and I diss murder being called a Springs and it was a different environment I didn't I didn't have patch of women's my head coach had a different coach at the time because Patrick stayed with the junior team no Patrick was the assistant coach to the national team he had zero power or say in any of the training this is the way the structure was working at the time and I wasn't mentally committed to the sport that time and that's not a good thing right so here I am now training with the national team huge importance everyone's trying hard everyone's committing ever their doing and I'm just going through the motions during that year I geez do you have a sense with the benefit of hindsight as to what what else might have been going on in your head at that time because you've now tasted success right and not only if you tasted success you've tasted success on the back of huge effort yeah right you had already discovered the weight room you had discovered your capacity for work which like Phelps and like Hyden and like all these other great athletes it's really the capacity for training that seems to differentiate them you figured out you had that you figured out your superpower and then you decided yeah I'm not gonna do it it's like this self-sabotage I think that early in my career and I actually I struggle with this later on in my career too as an athlete where it's going so well it's almost too perfect it's too easy let me throw let me throw a little monkey wrench in here and really let's see if I don't train and if I can really make the team again because let's see if

[01:14:52] I may be that good mmm yeah yeah I see what you're so psychologically I had a pattern I think of doing that what's the minimum effective dose of training I can get to still you know yeah let me basically like screw off and like almost build this opportunity totally away and see if I can still come back and get it and remind me cuz I'll come back to that and the way that I raced for many many years also is exactly like that let me wait until the very very last lap to make a move I don't that's a very dangerous like you talking about it has to be perfect you can't get the margins gone yeah even so you need to play with fire at that point right and I remember one time skating erases a great Canadian speed skater

[01:15:28] Marc Danielle he watched me do this I got weighted to the last half lap that I passed all four skaters on the outside and he said oh you're playing with fire man you're gonna get burned one day you know I remember that like in my head because I did and it and it did burn he said anyway so I mean just to go back to your question yeah that that's what happened I mean I've been blessed enough

[01:15:48] I was blessed to have a really unique gift to athletics and specifically in initial track speed skating and I was really squandering it was so easy it was too easy I couldn't recognize that you've got this talent you really also have to really really dedicate yourself and don't throw away this incredible opportunity because there's a thousand guys in line who have half the talent but would do ten times more work just to be a fraction of what you could possibly become I didn't recognize and it's just so stupid and I'm I kicked myself now thinking about that but that's what happened so the whole year that year in

[01:16:22] Colorado Springs I went there just going through the motions very defiant against my coach didn't really want to be there so when you entered the trials in December of 98 did you think you were gonna make the team now I have your lackluster performance I wrote it off as like I don't want to make the team so you don't wanna be elite lee self-sabotage at this point I am so far departed I'm the say I have the same mentality as I did before I went to Lake

[01:16:45] Placid and so when I go to these trials and we do a time trial in the beginning let's say there's let's say there's a hundred people show up for the trials you do a nine lap time trial and from those results only sixteen are now racing and that's that's the bracket sixteen people now is making a preliminary quarter euthymic final I finished a game so 17th

[01:17:07] I finished 16th and you made it no no I didn't make the team I made the cut you maybe get to go yeah but I got last so they should have got 17th I mean oh we're gonna have to skate the whole competition right right right I end up skiing the whole competition you know earn the right to earn the right to try to compete and we still have videotape to this every race I'm just crossing the line with like my head facing the ice and looking down and just completely defeated as you know what fifteen-year-old and so my father this to me is a really important part of my life my father sees this and he had been spending all his time in Seattle right so he might my father sees this he then takes me from Boston with the time so he takes me back to see after the meet you've lost I lost I mean everyone was just i hear that quiet conversations on my god he threw it away there's so much talent my dad's embarrassed right he said oh my god like this you know what the hell happened like you were number one less than a year ago you were supposed to go and be a medalist my dad already bought tickets for the olympic games like he'd already set aside time to spend there so now we're we're in a spot where my dad is like look you have to make a decision do you want to continue in this path of

[01:18:19] Olympic you know pursuit or do you want to do something else and I was like I don't know what I want to do he goes oh that's exactly what I'm talking about you don't know what you want to do so he takes me to this place where we used to go to and have vacations which is three and a half hours southwest of Seattle area called mo Clips beach which is sounds nice but it's the grains like you know 300 days a year and it's like very dark and it's beautiful now but he drops me off and he says you're gonna stay here until you figure it out what you want to do with your life I mean stay there you're gonna stay here in this cabin because either he rented a cabin and you gonna stay here until you're ready the real answer with what you're gonna do and I don't care what the answer is but you have to come to a real decision and commit yourself and that's what you're gonna do he leaves it's like the best parenting story in the history of parenting the bad kid right the only tough love is the only way to do this and he drops me off and he says this is what you got to do and I have food and I mean if there's no video games exactly you don't have a cell phone and iPad there's no there's nothing it's just me and nature and I have like workout gear

[01:19:22] I have a stationary bike like I have my old bike and I set up a little spinner in the back and that's it and like a pen and pad to write to make notes and journal and every day under needs 15 15 and you know again if you go back like I I grew up cutting myself so it's not a big deal to me but I mean thinking back

[01:19:41] I'm like oh my god that's a pretty serious what are you have you ever talked to your dad about what was going through his mind on the three and a half hour drive back to Seattle when he dropped you off he was terrified and scared and-and-and afraid he's making the wrong decision is he a bad parent is is too much am I gonna be able to handle it and I think my dad is like this is nothing else is working no one can get to this kid he's got all the green lights in his life and he's throwing him away like this is it this is the last straw this is the last effort with the guy didn't have you know Jaco willing down the street to like basically saying you know like did really drill home the importance of what it needs to be done

[01:20:22] I can call chocolate right now if you want I've invited him over for dinner tonight everyone thought of it so just thinking back I was so fractured mentally did that first night in that cabin hurt more than that first night your dad yanked you back to Lake Placid no it would be too tough nights right it was different because this time when I left the

[01:20:46] Olympic Trials in 98 I actually knew that I could have made the team and here's the sick part I think that if I trained just for one month before I probably would have been top three and I would have made a team had I just put like a fraction of effort and I didn't want to do I know for sure I wanted to taste such a devastating defeat when I'm supposed to win something I think I was addicted to that self-sabotage of okay

[01:21:12] I'm at the real bottom now what do I got to do and so I spent nine days in this cabin alone riding down making a journal I still have the notes actually I'm writing down my thoughts and praying and trying to just determine like why am I here what am I supposed to do give me a sign I was like mindlessly going out on these runs 45 minutes an hour half an hour and it's raining every single day by the way because this is December and it's cold and like there's no by the way there's no one there this is like the place where they send people what part I would like the witness protection programs like there's literally there's like there's a Native American reservation 15 miles up the road and other than that there's like there's literally no one else staying at these cabins so it's you and like someone from the Gambino crime family protection as a fifteen-year-old it's not fun I mean now I would like love to spend time there alone and so yes a thing to be address like me to get incredible I mean it's it's a place where I go when I need to make really really what I consider to be important decisions wrong I make a shift you still go

[01:22:12] I haven't been in a couple years but I'm I'm planning on taking actually my girlfriend pretty soon hmm it's a beautiful place is there's nature is I think it's a always been a very important part of my life I think my dad did that when I was you know where the exact cabin was I know he was that cabin an exact place they rebuilt it right so it's much nice someone bought thee it was called the iron Springs Resort at the time and back then it was a lion and springs generally don't go side by side it wasn't nice and definitely they should have left off the word resort for sure at the time it's like iron springs jail you know Penitentiary every road is basically like a one-way road and you're surround by the beautiful trees but again I'm just running everyday and mindless I'm just trying to figure it out 15 years old I'm at the fork in the road what I want to do do want to please my dad does my dad want me to speed skate does he want me to do this and then finally I was like you know what like I think I want to speed skate I think I want to actually truly dedicate myself to do this and also I was pretty bitter that I didn't make the team which doesn't make any sense right because I do have my cell threw it away you know but I was also like I hated the feeling of that of like the opportunity was there I didn't take it were you still in touch with your friends that you had grown up with that obviously for the year and a half prior you'd been somewhat detached from because you're now living this separate life training but what did your friends think of this opportunity I mean did a lot of them in in now they didn't understand what 80 were going through no I didn't really talk about it they didn't really understand and that was very much in my own head and at it was it was when I made the decision to continue one more time and really really give short-track speedskating a try is that changed my whole life well I mean what do you think happened in that nine days that made you because you had to leave there go back home watch the Olympics six weeks later basically watch three other skaters your flag and your colors then thought you know I really could have been one of those guys and then decide I mean not that you would have known it at the time but this would go on to occupy your life for the next 12 years right yeah so I remember calling my father and saying I made a decision I want to come back to Seattle and he didn't ask me what the decision was by the way he just came and picked me up and drove me back and during that three 1/2 hour drive I explained him what I want to do and he's

[01:24:36] I think I can feel that he's like okay let's see and so I go back to Lake Placid to train under a different coach you wait til the Olympics are over and this is this is still journey Olympics I go there right away because after the Olympics there's a World Team Trials which the the format's messed up but so after the Olympics is a World Team

[01:24:55] Trials now I have the opportunity of making the world team which at this time you know after the Olympics no-one's training no one cares but the world team and I remember just just kind of training really hard and studying and I get I get sixth at those World Team Trials so I was a double alternate which means I would ski no distances at all but I would basically just carry the bags for everybody and if two guys got hurt then I had a chance of getting in so I went to those World Championships and I was I just had a different view my something had switched in my mind and I started taking notes and I made promises to myself like real legitimate promises that I could never get up so when I get home I'm not calling anybody no one's even gonna know that I'm back home in

[01:25:36] Seattle and my offseason or the time spent after this annex for five months is gonna be complete dedicated towards just just being a monster and so set up that stationary bike in the basement had a small seven inch or 9 inch Sony Trinitron TV VCR and I just watched skating tapes every single day train twice a day alone until I arrived back in Colorado Springs as a part of the national team program and I was significantly more fit and stronger than anyone else and developed such a strong aerobic base that I was bearing everyone on my team even though I was still ranked number six I was by far number one and so the next big test for you would have been the 99 worlds yep which was where that year Sofia Bulgaria the real test was actually that year 98 I won my first come on oh and I'm winning a gold in the thousand meters against the reigning thousand meter Olympic champion kim dongsung and fabio Carta who was like many time you should have been world champion and I won I came out of nowhere that became my real first taste of of winning on the world circuit and again this is post Olympic year so it's not that important like people don't really care no one in the US is even watching this stuff really cared to me it also was a time where I got in I started to work with a sports psychologist and that was the big big difference in terms of performance was what did he or she teach you or what was the most important insight that you got early on from that experience so this this guy named David

[01:27:03] Cresswell who was pretty young at the time I think he was actually still studying he was going to how did you meet him he was brought in as an intern to basically look over a lot of the younger athletes and he also was doing a sport psychology kind of residency program at the Olympic Training Center and so he was so pro about you know all these different things and he started asking me we would play badminton like for fun I would make mistakes like over and over again and he would notice that

[01:27:27] I was kind of getting down on myself and he would ask me these like little questions Oh what happened there with that shot you know and I I this guy was so young I was like I can't respect this guy and I just didn't recognize the time and he was basically trying to figure my how I like what made me angry and the inconsistencies that would happen on the court were a direct representation of active what was happening in sport and so that was my first real foray into understanding and so we did everything from like you know meditation exercises to breathing exercises to writing down positive self the basics right positive self-talk manifesting what you want and then he began my real true process of visualization and then I ended up winning the 99 Junior World at that time in Montreal which was a huge when the time we were still eligible to compete a junior world still I was about 16 and it was hugely beneficial the mental component of the sport was always to me the most fascinating and the most underutilized in every aspect and to my detriment later on in my career too because we we did I did things that completely are very destructive when I mean the good thing about in terms of sports science and the training that we did and but to me it didn't care like I wanted the edge of being able to say I'm gonna wear this 45 pound weight vest I'm gonna go up this man to incline five times back to back and do skating jumps every 25 steps on one leg and then switch to the left and then do them all turning boom boom boom and just do that back to back until basically I throw up now there's no physiological benefit you're getting after like the first set right but the psychological advantage you would create is this is mental hardness that no one else would do and I loved it the harder it snowed outside the less people that are outside I want to be out there with the wave vest doing some dumb training that to me was the epitome of what was a driving force later on in my career and I craved it time and time again you mentioned it earlier and I know you've talked about in the past that you always looked at boxers as role models even though you didn't end up boxing and it's funny because that's very much a boxers mentality right I think with every sport so much of it is going on between the ears especially a sport when it's against another individual which is not to take away from a team sport but when you lose in tennis there's no subtlety about who won and who lost right but this idea of how the training feeds the beast you know growing up I felt it's so funny I mean on a much smaller level I remember I used to run at 4:30 every morning I'm so all of high school that was I would run at 4:30 and it had to be somewhere between 5 and 13 miles was the distance and growing up in Toronto it was so cold in the winter that like the colder it was in the darker it was the happier I felt because I remember thinking like the guy I'm gonna fight is not up at this moment there is no what he is in a warm bed and that just that fact absent any physiologic benefit became the thing that you needed to hang on to and again I don't know how many skaters thought that way but you clearly were training like a fighter and living in the Colorado Springs Olympic Training

[01:30:25] Center we were all rooming with different short track athletes and then there was one time in which instead of rooming with a short track athlete they had asked me if I wanted a room with a wrestler and everyone at the time was like no the wrestlers are dirty these guys always get staph infections they're like just nasty then they're they're crazy and I was like sure I don't mind the guy over with the wrestler and that was my first entrance into the mind of a fighter and I loved it because I'm look I wear spandex for a living in skating circles it's not the most manly thing known to men you know on this planet but I wanted it to be more than it's not as primal I mean you could argue wrestling or correcting are about as primal as any sport gets right you're fighting it's another human being basically in my own right I was fighting in my own ways right and there's many correlations there but I love the psychology of those wrestlers that I would see and I would go in the sauna post weight training workout and I would

[01:31:22] I was the only non wrestler in the sauna every time they were in there ever and I just like talking these guys and hearing them talk to each other and watching them cut weight and be like these guys are not human they are doing everything against what I was told from a sports science perspective and they still are winning like that mental toughness and fortitude that's what I craved was that old-school rocky mentality and that hardness that is created that I loved and I thought that was the only way that I could beat the

[01:31:53] Koreans that was the only because I didn't skate as beautiful they did and even to this day I still love it right I still like that mentality and he was a huge part of my career was was developing that mental fortitude and that strength and that consistency of being so obsessive and replaced my self-sabotage stuff with the self-sabotage came in the form of like let's just do some workout that makes no sense yeah you want the pendulum swung so far you stopped self sabotaging and incompetence and in effort and you started to overdo it and again I even just some of the videos I've watched I'm like oh my god like I watch it now as an old guy who's only thinking about how to avoid injury and I'm like oh my god like all the ways you could just destroyed your body with those things yeah we should do some really just ridiculous because training but you know again you're young your body's resilient you're gifted you're doing what you love you're an arena where that's the only thing that matters nothing else exists outside of this realm of short-track speedskating it's the most important thing in the world nothing else is here it was beautiful and I loved it and so 2002 is the big now you've had four years to get on the horse you've won some meats some important meats but for most

[01:33:10] Olympic athletes the world only considers the Olympics they don't care about winning the worlds even though the competition is just as stiff at the worlds so going into the trials in late a one were you nervous what was your confidence level going in to make the 2002 team I wasn't nervous at all I was ready and I skated incredibly fast there I did time trials like one 23.8 was my time trial time wait that's your 1500 that was my thousand meter time time and at a time no one was skating under 125 in the world so when the world heard that I had skated this lap time they knew that I was ready and you know the Koreans the first time they had to worry about an

[01:33:53] American skater who was in their race it was the first time a Canadian had to worry about me was you know kind of through 1998-99 so it's interesting the time trial is kind of a nice normalizing metric because it strips out the technique the strategy the where this person is so just because you have the fastest time trial doesn't at all mean you could win right you may still get you may have a dumb race you may not be able to maneuver and and sort of physically get in and around other skaters but it's certainly a beautiful metric too bro oh yeah yeah yeah it's sort of like in cycling it's your FTP yep he's a functional threshold pal and it shows I owe this guy is in incredible shape by the way what what is your lactate at the end of a thousand meter

[01:34:30] Time Trial how high would your lactate get I don't even remember my life that was low you're like Lance Armstrong in that regard where Lance is a lactate after the typical set that they would do which would be a one kilometer uphill sprint and they would do lactate checks at the end of these I mean his lactate levels were just half of everybody else's yeah I was very low so a lot of the sprinters had super high lactate levels like they were like in the 20s or something crazy mm-hmm and I was like always like nine or something weird

[01:34:56] Africa I forget the actual numbers but we would do six by 1000 meters with what rest I want to say the rest was two minutes so it's two minute rest or on an interval that gave you rest however you go to nine laps again fast Jesus yeah we hated doing lactate testing but that was that oh so they would prick you times time yeah yeah so that generates your lactate performance curve yep yeah yeah yeah and mine was pretty steady like I would maintain like my lap time and also my speed was around the same even the set four five six Wow in speed skating a lot of us got to do with technique so yeah although it's so funny like I don't know what they're doing these days in support science cuz I don't really pay much attention but I wonder if they're doing muscle biopsies on people and looking at lactate clearance and stuff like that now has no no no one's offering up a little vastus lateralis biopsy I and maybe they are in cycling but I can tell you from just listening to your podcast 99.999% of all athletes in the US who are Olympic level have no idea what they're doing when it comes to nutrition when it comes to training they're just doing what kind of they're told and I say that with all due respect right but that's just about much more impressive that they can do so much needs to change even slowly but since I retired in 2010 and being so obsessed with like looking back on my career and wondering how different I would have done it now versus then and just understanding how the human body works and all the different efficiencies that or deficiencies or overtraining and recovery and there was so much I think specifically for short-track speedskating because we were so predominantly dominated by the Korean culture and skating they never used sport science they did everything by eye very old-school right they were just technically the most proficient or the most beautiful biomechanics were and if you did study their training and you did study the way that they skated it all made sense but they again they didn't you they didn't have a sports science team they're measuring lactate when I went to my first Olympic Games in 2002 like the rumor to the Korean team was that I had like some unknown military NASA grade technology that I was using because I couldn't figure it out right because I didn't skate that Oh to Salt Lake City

[01:37:07] Salt Lake City okay yeah post 9/11 it was incredible experience it was incredible being 19 years old your first medal was it a gold or a silver my first medal was a silver was it the thousand it was a thousand meters oh my god watches that's the funniest race of them all I didn't know that was your first that was my metal race Olympic final can we talk about how funny the race isn't funny but the video we're gonna link to is exceptional right it's perfect it's actually perfect I'm so happy that I can laugh about it now I feel like so honored that I could have shown you that video you hadn't seen that now see how I showed it to you know so so perfect and so main level you know it's like it's what you're watching your face watch it for the first time I can't believe I couldn't have had that on film

[01:37:59] I think there was just genuine like joy like you couldn't stop laughing at that yeah which is I'm sure that would have not been that funny at the time so let's tell people about that race right so you're pretty favored going into this race it's you there's a Chinese later yeah to give you context I was in the cover of Sports Illustrated and I think that they were the article was about this is February of the game it's pretty amazing to put a speed skater on the cover of Sports Illustrated like a paul has the chance to win four medals four golds going these games and everyone in short track speed skating like that's not gonna happen no one's that dominant our sports too volatile and variable it's just impossible yeah which is true right I mean yes is it so much heart not to take anything away from long track but in long track you only have to worry about yourself right it's you right against a clock as you said in short track anything can go wrong yeah almost without exception seems to go wrong it always goes wrong yeah whatever plan you had never goes exact my favorite Mike Tyson line right

[01:39:00] I don't know Tyson actually said it but it's like everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face it's exactly what happens - yeah everyone's technique is beautiful until you start to get tired yeah or until some guy jumps right in front of you and like grabs you or pushes you or you get bumped or someone time trials it from the start now you're a whole plan for the beginning is completely out the door wasn't you know prepared for that so here we are a thousand meters I'm in the final I've got one of the best Canadian skaters

[01:39:27] Matsu turcotte I've got a Chinese legend Li Xiaojun I've got this young kid on him soo who's 16 years old he looks like Harry Potter with glasses literally that's our nickname as Harry Potter who skates so technically beautiful that I'll get back to that later but first to talking about it and then we've got Steven Bradbury the Australia is the Australian and by the way

[01:39:48] Estella's after so the race begins I have my strap Bradbury had called you before right didn't Bradbury have some grabs he was mean to me two days before the semi-final and he says amen hey mate the time Steven Bradbury was working for the skate manufacturer that made my skates in I think they were in in Brisbane he says okay I know you're probably gonna get on the podium would you mind giving a shout out for the Boot

[01:40:12] Company RBC revolutionary boot company Oh Steven no problem buddy you know the problem a he's good good to see you you know and he years ago so he's like the typical Australian he's I loved him I never thought this guy would make it past the preliminary round I know actually I don't even thinking about I didn't know he was skating the Olympics like that's how much non like he wasn't even there in my mind he was just another person who happened to be on the ice like he could have been replacing the blocks on the ice right he wasn't even a competitor you're thinking wait why are you wearing spandex just to replace the blocks like you could do had in much looser fitting clothes yeah I mean I say that like jokingly and then the day of the races he think this miraculous thing happens where two people get as qualified and fall down he makes it into semifinal and he makes into the final like he doesn't make it he makes it because people fall down and get his qualified and now he is exceeding here in this in this final with like any by the way the Canadian the Chinese the Korean and me anyone any one of you can win go anyone else gonna win gold I feel very very confident my ability to win gold and I had a very specific strategy two and a half laps to go I start my my outside past I blast off one lap to go I noticed that the Chinese skater is starting to set up a pass or at least put himself in position to pass me I didn't want that to have happened so I started skating very defensively and protecting my outside and inside position thus slowing us down we fight the Chinese Skeeter falls down about a half lap to go I swing a little bit wide the Korean skater tries to go on the inside of me he falls down into me I fall down and we all take out the last guy whose mat you two caught who's in third place the Canadian the Canadian the Chinese goes down the Korean takes me and then we all take out the Canadian so everyone falls down the same corner which to this day has never just the last corner the last corner I can see the finish line I'm in first place by the way so I feel like I'm gonna win

[01:42:01] I remember thinking my head I'm gonna win I remember thinking that and then literally as soon as I snap my fingers it was like the karmic reactions you're spinning out of Kentucky down and spinning I'm spinning I hit the wall I don't know what happens later find out that like my right skate through my back hitting the board's my right skate comes inward and actually stabs my left leg and that's where I have a small cut on that left leg I get up I throw my skates across a line and what I didn't know at the time that Steven Bradbury who was like over a half a lap behind when we all fell down only takes about eight seconds to get around though the track comes around and he finishes first and I end up finishing second in the video which I mean we're gonna link to the video of the race because I remember the first thing I thought when I saw that was I was actually impressed that you had the presence of mind to get up and get across the line because it looked and I'm not a skater so I can't speak to it but just as an observer it looked so disorienting when you went down it was that I was like geez I wouldn't even think to do anything other than just stand up like I wouldn't and it's not like it wouldn't take me two seconds to realize to get across the line but you didn't have two seconds it had to be like a brain stem activity there could be no cerebral involvement it had to be pure brain stem of I'm down

[01:43:22] I'm spinning I'm cut get across the line and you did what none of the other skaters were able to do like you were the first one in that whole melee to get across the line but of course Stephen got across first giving you the silver medal yeah and I ended up weighing the silver and it was it was a really good shout out for the Boot Company because the first and second guy both were wearing the same boot that's right that's right Steve and I remember it he just got goes across the line it raises one on apparently he's standing straight up right across the line I believe it it's the least impressive bribery cannot believe what just happened and no Australian was watching the

[01:44:01] Winter Olympics by the way so all of a sudden I got a surprise someone there from their media team oh my god yeah I got the surfing dragon get over me right right so he Steven wins I end up actually winning silver very disoriented had no idea what just happened and got a cut in the process and it was the most important race of my entire limpa career because at the time look I very much wanted to win not only that it was so important for me I felt like I should have won

[01:44:32] I think that's natural for me to say that right I really felt like I should have won and I felt like Steven should not have won I didn't know actually he won at that time I couldn't believe what just happened and I was trying to figure out in my head and process meaning after you've crossed the line it's still not entirely clear that he's won even though you've seen him also skate across the line sort of bolt upright but you haven't figured this out yeah I mean I knew I knew that someone crossed the line and it was probably Steven but more important I was figuring out like what just happened right is there a rule that says like you can't come from 200 feet behind whenever yeah what's going was more like I was more thinking like that last half lap like what happened and then I noticed it like I got this itch

[01:45:15] II feeling on my left leg so you don't even realize you've cut rest' had no idea at the point at that point until I went into the locker room and took my skin suit off and it had a chance of like oh my gosh like that was a crazy crazy race and I remember coming out and someone asked me what does it feel like to lose the gold so I was the first question is the first question my own I didn't I didn't lose the gold I won I won the silver you know and that that answer wasn't entirely me there was a guy Brent Pamela who was our sports physician the time came in a locker room because II had to look at my cut before we went back out there to go receive our medals and he was like hey man I know you wanted to win but that was incredible like you have to be so proud of yourself for having that ability to cross the line it was so instinctive right it would be an idiot to claim that I had that plan it was all my grand master idea to do that but it wasn't I just I felt like I had to finish the race dude it's another box analogy right and we can't get away from the fact that your name is Apollo okay and in the second rocky when rocky and Apollo fight they both go down this is a very rare occurrence in boxing that both fighters go down and if they both can't get up it's a draw but if one of them can get up and the other guy can he's the winner and obviously everybody knows how that goes rocky amazingly managed to get up while Apollo couldn't so this time Apollo actually got up first got up first by finished second and goes my first Olympic Games I felt like I had been through a lot psychologically even though you have to race again that night two days later okay oh this is something I should tell you before I went out there I had to get stitched up quickly guess who my surgeon was Eric Hyden come on yes Eric Hyden so

[01:46:54] Eric Hyden stitches me up and I was like looking at him he's like hey man that wasn't amazing like that was so incredible and all on what I was like Eric I'm just trying to be like you I'm just trying to win every distance right cuz like you know like I still even though it was it's pretty impossible that's what I wanted to do I wanted to win all I wanted to sweep just like Eric

[01:47:12] Hyden did and I had the ability to if everything went in my direction and this was the first blemish but it was pretty cool to be able to be stitched up by kind of your idol and then have that conversation and then have him say like hey look your Olympics aren't over yet like you're just getting started so get back into the game remain your focus and forget about this race as much as you can and prepare for the next one that went out there happy as hell nineteen year old kid from Seattle could have thrown it all away and here I was competing in my first Olympic Games post 9/11 hearing thousands of Americans screaming USA chanting my name I would never replace that with anything ever in my life it was so it was just it was awesome it made it every and I felt so proud to be able to win a medal for the

[01:47:59] US and win a medal for my family and for my team and for my country it was long after the race did you get to talk to your dad immediately because NBC grabbed him and they won him right down by the ice and right away what was his reaction he was just proud was he worried about your leg I mean what else was going on in his mind he was worried about my leg he was right by the ringside and he's my father's looking in I see my dad right away he's just he's is very proud you know and that to me it felt very very good and I'm were standing on the podium even though not hearing my you know my own national anthem being played just feeling amazing and actually thinking back if there was any person in that race who I would want to win the gold versus me it would probably would have been Steven Bradbury and just because that guy and people don't know this he had been through hell like a skate blade have gone through that guy's leg at one point like he had almost died many times on the ice like pools and pools of blood he had come back from devastating injuries broke his back like weird crazy stuff and through it all he stuck with the sport and he was the last man standing he wasn't the best speed skater he wasn't the most technically gifted physically he was a monster but he wasn't supposed to win that race but because he didn't give up he he ended up winning that race when everyone else was better than him everyone else was there and it was it's pretty remarkable so Matt target who's a swimmer an Australian swimmer he's been to I think three Olympics he's a good friend of mine and I actually sent him the video that we're gonna also link to because that's the one we were talking about earlier which is the there's an

[01:49:31] Australian guy who does a commentary and voice over dubs the video and it's really funny his point being is like if you just stay out of people's way you can still win right right and he met I think he said to me that in Australia there's still an expression around his name like you can pull a bribery all right yeah you win the lottery oh you just pulled a bribery oh you jumped of a plane your parachute didn't it didn't open and then somehow someone else grabs you did a Bradbury Ghostfreak Golden

[01:49:55] Horseshoe luck by the way Steven Bradbury retired that night everyone the gold he yeah he's like this is the pinnacle this is the I am now on and I am I have an Australian stamp with my face on it I this doesn't get better than this for me Australia's first Winter Olympic gold medal so you had to go on and continue through these games so how did the rest of those games go my next race was the 1,500 metres in which I was battling against my rival the time which was two guys mark Daniel from Canada and also kim dongsung from south korea who was the reigning Olympic champion in that distance and kim dongsung had this very specific strategy which he had been testing on me throughout the entire year and that was he was gonna lead the race with about seven laps to go just do a negative split so every lap get a little bit faster a little bit faster a little faster and escape very defensively and I my strategy was known all over the world that I always waded into the last two laps because your explosiveness you just basically based on your lactate tolerance and your explosiveness you're gonna have muscle somebody like I had another gear that other people didn't have and I think that the training that we did at that time directly just you know is a massive attribute to exploding when there was a lap or two laps to go as long as I could have that reserve but you needed the lane you had to be able to technically you could have the ice to do that right there's got to be space and so in short track speed skating if I'm passing a skater in front of me and we have some sort of a conflict or collision I get disqualified at the time that's what the rules were so you had to pass the other skater who was in front of you completely cleanly with no contact that puts a huge onus on the guy passing yeah because he's got to take a huge distance well they changed the rules after this after this Olympics but at the time that's what the rules were and so it was very important to pass completely cleanly with no contact in any capacity and I remember everyone knew that my inside passing lane was the best know how many kilometers an hour you guys going about 40 we're going like around 35 plus miles an hour yeah yeah so you're going about 50 kilometers an hour yeah there is at that speed aerodynamics is everything like there's an enormous draft advantage if you can if you can slingshot around someone right and I could skate behind someone all day long and break Road records because I was so comfortable right anyone could but I wasn't very good at leading for whatever reason my technical ability would change and my track pattern would change which is so interesting given that you still broke you stoled that time trial world record like going under 125 because that's there's no one blocking the wind for you there right but later on my career that became less and less of a big attribute of mine so I was less and less a good time traveler more and more of a good racer so to speak about a lap and a half to go in the 1500 meters I mean I'm actually in fifth place I passed three skaters on the inside to pass into second place now there's a lap remaining it's me and kim dongsung i know that there's only one I'm actually doing this payal app too late I probably should've done this earlier but I didn't wait a little bit too long looking back and I tried one one last pass on him on the inside I recognized right away that he had known that I was gonna be passing on the inside so he had protected that inside lane position he really really came over to protect that position as much as possible and I wanted to make sure there was no contact in any capacity so I put my arms up to show the referee who was in the corner look there's no contact I'm not pushing him there's nothing going on and I slipped back in a second finish the race he ends up getting disqualified even though he finishes the race and wins he had been parading around his South

[01:53:30] Korean flag and celebrating in victory my coaches knew that there was gonna be a call being made and why was he disqualified so he at the time there was something called cross tracking so even though you're not so great you're supposed to if you come out of the corner you're supposed to maintain you or maintain your lane effective your lane is very something you come out of the corner and there's technically an inside lane you can't immediately cut it off right it's like blocking and so he was asked Walla fide I was awarded the gold and thus began this crazy relationship with the country of South

[01:54:01] Korea that I would have never been able to explain and so you get a silver when you should have had a gold you get a gold that you feel is this really a silver yeah it wasn't a clean win yeah right that's very clear but I was awarded it and at the end of the day a win is a win and so I celebrate it as such so this time you get to hear your national anthem for the first time my national and what is that like for the first time it's incredible it's everything you can think it we sit there I remember watching that on TV I remember where I was watching that on TV and it's like I don't know you it's but it's still emotional for us to watch this right and to sort of I think we put ourselves in the shoes of like these kids right and we think like wow I can't imagine the sacrifice they just went through the difference between winning and losing seems to be almost random stochastic if you will right but you did it wow I can't believe it you're standing there and I mean I think that's why we just love the Olympics even sports that we don't necessarily pay attention to outside of the Olympics right I think that the fascination is like we know these athletes aren't doing for money because there is no money the

[01:55:09] Olympics base you know with the exception of like the point zero zero one percent and you know how much they dedicate you know that four and eight and twelve years of their life has dedicated towards this one moment and it's there's a sense of purity associated with that that they really truly do it because they love the sport they want to go to the Olympic Games and they want to be the best against the world's best and I think we can appreciate that you want two more medals in o2 didn't you know I won I just won those two medals you did okay so you didn't win on the relay that year no when the guys fell in the relay I feel like we would have won gold actually they had he not fallen which has got to be tough I mean you always feel bad I don't i follow swimming much more closely obviously in any other sport but it's always just the saddest thing for me when i see a guy on the swim you know on the four by whatever this yet thing is and when that one person has a bad leg you just you feel worse for them than you feel for the other swimmers who who swam their best cuz like it's just hard Anna and I always sort of think it's beautiful when people can sole the one guy who has the bad race or the one girl who has the bad race yeah in short track speed skating it's such a variable we grow up with that mentality we call it that short track that's your equivalent of happens right is that that short track that short track like look man like you plan everything you are the best you've been undefeated for years you get the Olympic Games boom you fall down that's short track like that's the sport that you signed up for and if you can't subscribe that mentality you chose the wrong sport but short track to me is very much like life very much like life right you can do everything right and for whatever reason something out of your control gets thrown away and you have to take it as such and learn from it obviously and come back stronger and better but for the most part I think that's what it is but you became one of the really few athletes that rose above the sport at least from a commercial standpoint I mean they're obviously a handful of Olympic athletes that we can all name that end up on the were you in the cover of a Wheaties box

[01:57:05] I wasn't cover louise bob that's that's like about is as americans it might not be necessarily the most lucrative commercial opportunity but it is certainly the most distinguished right i mean to be on the Wheaties box is sort of it's always a dream yeah so i'm not going to ask you to sort of explain why you think you rose to that level how much of it do you think had to do with just what you did on the ice versus something about you that sort of captivated people's interests that goes beyond just the performance like you know obviously you're a good-looking guy you're articulate your story is incredibly interesting as evidenced by the fact that we could sit here and talk about this for like six days and you also seem very comfortable in that role to like it wasn't you get the sense some athletes are really uncomfortable with that they're appreciative of it and it's this great opportunity to sort of ramune rate some of their success but you seem like totally natural in that role right I think yeah I mean I look i was extremely blessed to be able to be one of the few athletes that both NBC chose and wanted to feature as a star athlete and my story for whatever reason and I think look immigrant father comes to the u.s. doesn't have anything tries to raise this kid this kid is bad finds his life through sport turns it around understands the power that he has throughout the sport and then against all odds I was able to deliver in some capacity and I didn't deliver a gold in that first race it was a silver bull who's a scrappy silver I mean I think that's in some ways I think people much prefer like if you had gone out you know

[01:58:39] I don't know what the expression is in speed kidding but if you'd gone wire-to-wire right if you'd time trialed that event and won by five lengths or you know by five you know body lengths or whatever it's like okay wow he's dominant but to fall cut your leg you know barely know which way is up and down and managed to really take the group before that you're racing against and be the first one across the line that's a that's a heartfelt silver that

[01:59:03] I think most people probably find more appealing and it actually probably creates a better substrate for the way we like to use sport as metaphor for life I think that's exactly I couldn't have articulated better you know I think that we you know Americans look we love dominance we love to win but we also like to see a story that that somewhat mirrors what we can relate to and it wasn't perfect in any way but

[01:59:27] I think at the end I was I also didn't want to cross a line and even though I was upset I didn't go I didn't want to show that and want to be like hey I should have won gold that guy that Australian guy shouldn't been in the final he's not a good skater yeah that I didn't want to have or be near that type of a mentality instead I had an opportunity thing to be really really appreciative and have gratitude for the chance to even be there number one even though I was supposed to win the race but take it from that perspective and then just like I won my first Olympic medal you know like that that's look this is how the race played out not to plan not exactly how I would have written it but this is how it went and

[02:00:07] I've been through a lot personally to get to that point and I really really wanted people to see that I was proud to win that silver I was proud of when a bronze I was proud to be there and compete that was really important for me to people to recognize and see that I didn't take it lightly I didn't take it for granted like I'd done in the past and it was something that I was humbled by and I mean I got to the start line in that race and people were chanting my name like in the arena I'm I'm 19 years old that that is not normal of any stretch of the imagination imagine that's different even from the worlds like that's a totally different experience right it was so different now a camera in my face every second every inch that I move around and there's immense pressure I hear people in the audience who I don't know Apollo bring home the gold you know like and and I can feel like the actual genuine authenticity that exists within saying bring home that the people really really wanted me to win oh yeah and you've alluded to it already but this was only what four months after 9/11 this was still a very unified country in a way that I don't know that we've experienced since I'm walking in the opening ceremonies in Salt Lake City from our staging area to inside the time was called the Delta Center that's where they look that opening ceremonies were and I remember seeing on all of the rooftops and in the trees all of the

[02:01:30] American servicemen snipers wow they're sitting there and I'm looking up and seeing them and they they were cuz they know it's us right cuz they but they've got their their gaze on the goggles and they wave and I'm like this is much bigger than me my representation of what I do my silly of short-track speedskating my insignificance of going in circles in this world and I'm 19 so I can't really understand it to that degree but the feeling is there that what I do here is far more important than the results that

[02:02:03] I give obviously I want to win I want to bring home the color gold because that is what we signify with being successful but at the end of the day I wanted the representation of who I was on the ice at that period of time to reflect I think what we would be proud of and that would make my father proud and I knew if

[02:02:22] I had that happen that I could be proud that our country be proud aside from all the other conflict and things that we disagree with that was a really important part right of what I was doing and it's a tremendous amount of pressure to that you don't recognize no one can prepare you for the Olympic Games I used to do visualization and hear and have previous tapes recorded and then like try to visualize and close my eyes and visualize the race that I wanted to have happen while the crowd is in my ears but when I went out there for my first race

[02:02:47] I could nothing come a pair for me for that my heart rate jumped from like whatever being like 50 to like 160 like literally within seconds and I was like oh my god like I'm starting this nine lap race now at threshold you know like I'm not prepared for those six by 1000 so paying off now yeah it's also a very addictive feeling so what's the letdown like after the two weeks after the games are over yeah oh well depends on how you do so you've done well you've obviously got a great commercial career ahead of you but you still have four years until you're gonna be back on that stage again you'll go to the Worlds again you'll do

[02:03:24] World Cup but you're not gonna feel that electricity for four more years right correct and nothing replaces the Olympic Games there's no competition on the planet so post games you I go on the media whirlwind tour for basically six to eight months I do every single interview and conversation and sponsorships and commercial advertisers and stuff because that's the only way use an Olympic athlete can generate any source of revenue you're not really paid doing gold medals you're not paid to be part of the team you're there and so what percentage of Olympians United

[02:03:53] States Olympians can secure enough sponsorship that that can become a sole source of income to sustain them through a Olympic run ie they do not need to go out and get another job maybe less than a percent Wow for sure less than a percent because even if you win a gold it doesn't necessarily guarantee you to have a good generating of income if for whatever reason you weren't featured or and we see didn't see you or sponsorships aren't interested you just you're a guy with a gold medal and I know a few who won gold who have the most normal jobs that we normally would see like wow that guy won gold and why is he working here doing this like day-to-day activity like this manual labor but that's just the reality of what happened so I was blessed I didn't have to do that

[02:04:36] I got great sponsorship opportunities and I took the sport of show track speed skating which was relatively completely unknown to most Americans and the first time they ever saw was that thousand meters in which I fell down and people were like oh my god this is the craziest sport I've ever seen in my life and it was like it's like roller derby yeah that's the way people say NASCAR on ice we call it right and it's crazy it's fun it's fast it's explosive there's strategy it's unpredictable there's crashes it's aggressive the only thing you know if they just allowed you to punch each other it would be like the next American like checkbox should be like carry knives to at least be able to like you know clothesline somebody right yeah that would be you get some different looking aliens on the oh sure there's so many other things I want to talk about and I realize like we're getting looks out there because they want us to go out for dinner so let's talk about oh six and ten so you know one of the things you've told me before that I was blown away by was the difference in your body weight between 2002 2006 and 2010 most athletes who go from being 19 to 23 to 27 are putting on more muscle or getting bigger and bigger right you're maintaining muscle and getting leaner and leaner and leaner remind me again the difference between your fighting weight in those three Olympics sure so in in 2002 the training focus was power ballistic strength and speed those are the important factors in that time period do you remember how many watts you could generate for a minute on a got an ERG I don't remember I have to ask dr. Randy Wilbur who's I think he's still at the Olympic Training Center in

[02:06:15] Colorado Springs ahead of dude you gotta you gotta like get all that data and send it to me like I am well wants so badly to see your LPC's and your wattages and stuff like that I bet it was just sick it was good you know I don't know if it was like astronomically high like I've hear these stories of other athletes who were short track speed skaters to be just freak in every genetic response but my ability was just recovered really quickly that was the one component I remember doing a test in remember doing all these different sport science tests I remember these these doctors basically saying like you need to live at altitude like your body responds extremely well the higher you go for whatever reason your body just produces a ridiculous amount of red blood cells you come down and you you love it so in your bility to recover high or low is is different yeah the first time I trained at altitude I got to go and swim in Colorado I was like like I'm not swimming I'm not doing the same stroke like nothing feels the same up here I couldn't believe it yeah I think Colorado is like 6,400 feet I think you're at the elevation you know and back down we just we lived high and we slept high I think today isn't the conventional wisdom you want to live high trained low doesn't that produce the best correct come yeah that's correct so you're better off actually having a tent and training at sea level yeah yeah and then like there's some arguments against the entire tent related what type of stress that places on that human body and is that is it natural form of stress and you get the proper response there's some arguments back and forth that dr. Ronnie Wilber was like no I think the actual natural environment far exceeds I'm sure it but something that you tried to explain to me obviously I didn't understand but so in 2002 you're weighing what so 2002 I weighed approximately 164 to 167 so call it 165 right that was my fighting weight and I could leg press around 1400 1450 1500 pounds suck on it but I'm just giving you just context to a small car yeah my back squat was never really that high I think a lot of had to do with just the way that I hinged I was very good hunched over in that position I could generate a lot of power don't want to be squatting in that please lead opposite but you were still probably what squatting I think you said you were probably in the mid 300s for 12 reps yeah about 350 365 just still but that's probably a max of 500 at a body weight of 160 is no slouch yeah I mean my vertical was really high almost like 36 Jesus do you know what your single leg vertical was no I don't remember that again this is all stuff that I wish that we had docked because we trained so hard I'm convinced by the way the single leg vertical is probably the best predictor of speed yeah I think so and your ability to generate force in the ground yeah I'd like to I like to see the difference between doing like a single jump and doing a series of two or three and seeing that reaction time and generating a power over all these cool tools and ideas that I wish we had implemented if I had the ability we just didn't implement them properly back then so when oh six what did you wear oh six I weighed about 155 pounds but I could still lay press the same amount of weight so I was significantly leaner you know six significantly leaner long gone is the chubby boy yeah gone and we have new coaches I have a Chinese coach going those games these were in Italy this year yes and I perform very well in those games I ended up winning in gold in the 500 meters I won wire-to-wire control the race did very well wasn't the best skater out there for sure but strategically I it was my day did you also get a real a medal about here yes we did get a bronze and then what did you weigh in 2010 and then 2010 my goal was to be under 150 and I hadn't been under 150 since I was 14 years old right when I was 14 I was I can 135 137 and then I ballooned back up obviously so my goal was to be under 150 end up competing like between 142 and 146 so I would say like on average is about 140 345 pounds how much strength did you give up to get there it was weird because I could leg press the same amount of weight

[02:10:19] I got leg press nearly 2,000 pounds at that weight like 1,900 something like that right the difference was my pure ballistic power was drastically different I stopped doing all Olympic lifts so were you doing a lot of plyometrics a lot of weighted plyometrics but again I cut most of that weight that year like that Olympic season so you can imagine like the first half of the year was spent just cutting this weight so essentially living in a catabolic environment all the time to eat excess muscle mass from your upper body traps arms you know I mean I had no I seen that picture my arms were so skinny back then it was very similar to what you'd see in someone who's climbing and it's what I remember Lance saying that during the tour years he wouldn't do one pushup or swim one lap in the spring and going into it because it's like you had to be able to waste as much muscle as possible from the upper body you want complete atrophy from the hips up and there's a crazy stories that we hear that like these cyclists would like basically put themselves in a sling in the summers during their training right there's a lose also and the reason why and people like why would you want that body tape those people that asked that question have never ridden a bike up a hill it is

[02:11:34] I mean cycling in many ways is such a beautiful sport because there are a few sports that can be reduced to such formulaic outcomes and when you can take functional threshold power divided by mass in kilos and get a number in watts per kilo that essentially predicts who's gonna win the race up a hill that's pretty amazing then speed skating it's harder because one I don't know what the metric is of power but to absolute power to translate to a bike is much easier like you're transmitting from the leg to the pedal to the crank to the wheel but in skating there's more to it right it's not entirely clear what the relationship is between the 2,000 pounds that you can leg press versus how many of those pounds in watts are hitting the ice right there probably is not a correlation or it's probably loose correlation but yeah yeah but everyone's different cuz if you can't put the technique it's irrelevant yes like like a bike the technique is pretty simple you know it's a push and pull at the basic level right but in speed skating there's seven parts to one push literally there's seven parts to one push that you have to drill in your head to make it automatic and normal and you're never on just one plane of balance on that piece of blade like you're in the heel now you're in the middle now you're back towards the heel and then you finish the ball or towards a toe and it's different depending on the speed what you're doing the track pattern there's so many elements that are always changing for example the

[02:12:59] Koreans they don't lift weights right that became my obsession this started because you went to Korea didn't you I went to Korea for 2000 2007 because I was so obsessed and fascinated with how they continuously kept producing incredible athletes that I was competitive against and they just skated so beautiful now you were at this point pretty much a god to them and they were gods to you did they welcomed you with open arms they did actually they invited me and partially because I think they just wanted to study me they just wanted to see like what made me tick how strong is my ability to train can I handle their type of training atmosphere and environment and I was fascinated to go into the belly of the beast like I wanted to go into that lion's den and understand what makes them tick and my dad was completely against it but I was like this is something I have to do and eventually he was like this is something why was your dad against it so after the 2002 Olympic Games there was after that race where I was awarded the gold and there was 16,000 emails sent in the form of death threats to the United States of limping Committee because of that race to me it was pretty crazy so it was again it was it was a time where my relationship with Korea changed overnight we ended up not going to Korea for two years for competitions because we were unsure of the environment and you say we you mean you and your dad or no a US team we want to sweat I mean my face was on a toilet paper inside the country like I was the second most hated person aside from Osama bin Laden inside that country literally unbelievable it was unbelievable we can talk about this other thing like for two hours I have the thousand stories in relation to that and like when I actually decided to go against everyone's wishes I was like I can't just keep running from this problem I gotta go the number one they haven't heard me tell my story like they hate me for a reasons that are unexplainable and also they're not really that fair because they don't know me I'm not a referee I didn't make the judging call I am an athlete I am a sportsman I compete like anyone else does under the same rules in capacities and I walk away regardless of outcome right and it was a changing time so the

[02:15:04] Koreans were always number one I was the only threat at the time to them and their legacy and it was a huge huge part of my fascination with actually saying you know what I got to go there even though they're gonna study me I have to go and understand it's like someone going to train with Usain Bolt in

[02:15:20] Jamaica for like three months and seeing what is he doing is he doing some exercise what are they eating what is their sleeping habits where's their recovery how did they get massage right what kind of all these elements and you already knew that they weren't doing the type of off ice work that you were what surprised you the most about what they did on ice the two things that I recognized right away was their efficiency in training there was no talking when you're on the ice there was all business when you showed up at the ice rink at 4:00 in the morning 4:30 in the morning there was already probably 30 skaters there who were 8 to 12 years old who had been practicing technical drills before you even got there so their commitment to perfection in terms of technique is drilled in at a very young age so their efficiency ratio they don't have to be as strong as me in the weight room because there's so much more efficient that's what it came down to this by the way has another beautiful parallel to swimming right I mean unlike cycling in swimming the relationship between the power you can actually generate and how you can transmit it to the water is elusive and I don't know if the guy who wins the race is necessarily the strongest on land it really doesn't matter it's so much more about avoiding drag and efficiently putting your muscle into the go so in that sense it's much more like skating where there are certain swimmers who have some of the most unimpressive physiques I mean

[02:16:40] Phelps has such an impressive physique to begin with right it's sort of the best of both worlds but there are there are some really ridiculously scrawny looking pathetic swimmers who like that like biscuit chested dudes that can like literally can't do anything but when they get in the water they sure as hell can do some sure it's very much the same way with with speed skating and and and

[02:17:02] I saw that and when I read the first thing I recognized was their ability to copy each other was unlike anything I've ever seen when you go watch a u.s. short track speed skating practice everyone skates entirely different you can pick out who's ooh when you watch a Korean speed skating practice through all this you don't look the same you could it's a couple of guys they stand out but for the most part in it's beautiful wat they're very quiet you know make a lot of noise when they go around the corner they're extremely efficient and I remember the first day that I showed up we broke like five old records in that practice and two of the girls who were leading by the way in the in the 3000 meter we did five times 3000 meters five times 27 laps to the girls I never ended up seeing for the next couple of years they never made the team and they were the ones who were leading this from start till finish breaking the world records so they just have a mass talent pool of skaters that they can just pick and choose from and just like the old school Eric Hyden era of like survival of the fittest we're gonna pick out the pure genetic monsters who not only technically are the most efficient but also can handle the greatest amount of volume and load and training they are gonna rise to the top and usually the south korean skaters only last one or two olympics at the absolute most before they're just gone and they just like literally overnight they just get replaced by the next car game they can't make the team wow yeah so my whole goal for showing up in Vancouver was in 2002

[02:18:24] I was dominant 2006 I had won a gold probably could not have replicated that and in 2007 I was losing my dominance in the sport significantly and people were skating so fast and there was that mostly just apparent to you or do you cause usually the athletes the first to figure that out yeah or was it also visible to those around you I think people started notice that I was no longer this undefeatable unrecognizable unknown mystery athlete from the US everyone knew my strategy everyone knew my natural gait and rhythm of skating and it was like do or die I wasn't dominant and I wasn't winning I was winning but I wasn't winning with the same fashion I was where people were like oh my god that guy just smashed the pack so was there a period then between oh seven and ten when you were even wondering if he would come back it was not wondering if I wasn't comebacks I'd already committed it was more how do I actually get to the games and have a chance at meddling that was the conversation like how can I win against this next generation of South Korean athletes that have never faced before who are so fast and so good how old you're you're now 25 right 26 they're 18 19 20 that was usually the range which is interesting because if you really think about it for a male speed based sport you should still be able to peak in your mid-20s yep for whatever reason it was always a young man's sport for track speed skating and a lot of stuff to do with flexibility and the way in which do you move and maybe there's no correlation in the capacity but that's what it was in 2002 a lot of the heavier guys had to retire before 2006 they couldn't meet the cut that the sport had changed in 2006 2010 a whole next generation of guys were tired because again they couldn't meet the cut the way that we trained the focal points what was important during training the elements that made you a fast speed skater are all changed and we had a big coaching turnover so we went from a Chinese code

[02:20:10] I had a orig I had a Canadian coach American coach to that a chinese coach to then to korean coaches who threw everything out the window when it came to sports science and said we were gonna take you Apollo and change the way that you technically skate and physiologically my goal was to show up as a different type of an athlete that they would never prepare for so I want to change my natural gait and rhythm I can't help but bring the rocky metaphor back this is when rocky comes back to

[02:20:34] Fight Club he's saying yeah because he gets killed by club or fighting Rocky style correct and then Apollo comes back to train him I'm grinning as I say this because I realize it sounds so stupid but it's really the example right it's like you can't come back and fight clubber the same way you got to lose like 15 pounds and you actually have to box and set a slug correct if I want to be competitive if I took the same strategy of success from 2006 and it doesn't n I won't make the semi-final that's a parent and so that meant I had to make drastic and you realize this by oh seven by oh seven years to change everything after I had gone to Korea and and skated and recognized and knew what

[02:21:10] I was really up against and saw this next generation of South Korean athletes who were training there that would be the ones that I would compete against and also recognize also when I stepped on the ice in 2010 and look in the coach's box and see that I would have skated against 80% of the coaches because they all had retired and became coaches of those national teams who were then coaching their athletes to beat me they know me better than anybody they'd seen me for 15 years that point right technically so the goal was to show up as someone who they couldn't prepare for different strategy different mentality different training and that meant drastic decisions and changes and so I hired a strength and conditioning coach who lived with me at my house in Salt Lake City Utah to watch and monitor every single thing that I ate every single extra training regimen that we did and I was a guy that I was never like you never had to push me to train more it was like okay we need to figure out how to rest yeah like let's let's figure out how to do some things a little bit better better here and so it became a huge emphasis on recovery a massive emphasis on nutrition which is recovery and just making sure that everything that I was doing was correlating with my end result which was being let's be this light let's maintain this strength and I know if I can at least do those two things I've got the unique technical ability to at least get myself to the podium and it was a struggle because I love to eat I love food I'm always hungry and at 1:53 there's not a lot of weight to lose like that like my skin was very thin around my legs like I had it was all muscle so

[02:22:36] I had to go catabolic I had to lose excess muscle mass that wasn't being specifically derived from the sport and perhaps was being generated from the weight training that we were doing whether it was deadlifts with those poles with her I mean there was no more I mean in 2019 1999 we were still doing bench press right it's a part of our book weight training program that's got that makes no sense in gender so even those cleans really I mean you could argue there was obviously an explosive benefit millions two and a half to three pounds there probably an upper body mass right that you just don't necessarily need now the benefit from those is gettable and looking back I probably should have incorporated some specific type of Olympic or deadlift like activity but I was so hyper focused and obsessed with losing weight I remember writing down on these little post-it notes and putting them all throughout my house the weight and then like like zero regrets like make sure you get to the

[02:23:30] Olympic Games with zero regrets regardless of your outcome there you have to arrive leaving absolutely no stones unturned in your preparation you wrote a book by this title years later yeah and that was just because that was I was your mom I mentality and and I was doing like dumb workouts agree I had two training sessions with the Olympic team and then we would do an additional one or two on top of that every day the week with the exception of

[02:23:54] Saturday and Sunday which was peer recovery Saturday morning we would skate Saturday afternoon and was recovery Sunday well there was recovery but the rest of time I was doing think it's crazy some sprints and intervals on a treadmill that my my strength conditioning coach could monitor watch my gait we would try and change the way that I naturally ran so we increased the the cadence and I wanted to be a higher cadence athlete who had very high cadence versus the previous Apollo which was all power slow and it was very hard it's nearly impossible to change but that was the goal point and which is interesting to come back to a cycling analogy here right which is today we see cyclists riding at a much higher cadence and a lower torque to generate comparable power shifting the load to the cardiovascular system from the muscular system yep and all comes down to efficiency right generate the least amount of lactic acid and increase the amount of speed and repetitions that you are crossing over in the corner without the more static you are on one leg the more strength and lactic acid you essentially are producing so if you can decrease the amount of time you are on each leg the less likelihood you are to get tired as long as you're naturally a bit able to do that so I mean it was a real struggle like I cracked on that treadmill I cracked in the weight room all of the time and I've questioned my path on that process because you can imagine right I I'm a guy here who I have a recipe for success I know what works and now you're gonna abandon it not only do I abandon I go the complete opposite direction and I change everything and everything that I know about what made me me in hopes that I would do this gamble and show up to

[02:25:31] Olympic Games and be the best I've ever been and completely unpredictable to the other athletes and it remarkably worked out but there was a lot of questioning in my head and I remember many many nights I'd lay in bed starving so incredibly hungry because I just I for sure wasn't getting enough calories my body absolutely and just like wondering like is this the right path towards success is this going to work because the last thing I want to do is get to the games you'd be like that was a bad decision right and that's painful for so many reasons not the least of which being you have just spent four years before you got that feedback right it's one thing to say you know I'm gonna try this new way of washing my car today and see if it produces streaks or no streaks and then you do it and it produces streaks and you're like wow okay that was 30 minutes I wasted but like this is for years to figure out that the new washing technique streaks the car yeah and for the first four and a half months like I just wasn't skating very well I was tired I was fatigued all the time other athletes on my team were better and skating faster than I was I was doing workouts that I probably shouldn't have been doing at that latent stage and the chatter is basically he's sticking around for one too many

[02:26:43] Olympics yeah and he's like lost his mind like he's like what is he doing like look how much weight he's losing on like a monthly basis but again goes back to that psychological advantage of this is what it took and this is the place that I was in and to me having that edge of going to a place where no one else went to and also it's very personal right going to a place where you never knew was possible it's incredibly powerful it's you have a sense of inner strength when you get to those Olympic

[02:27:12] Games and I hadn't raced a single race but I was smiling before that even happened I felt so like weightless not only because I'd lost 20 pounds from over my career but because I just I really felt prepared could I have done it differently absolutely could I've gone back and implemented Sport Science and other elements that we now know would have dramatically increased my performance ratio yes but the process of going through that and hardening my mentality and going through those dark times where you're questioning yourself being in a sauna alone everyday sweating and meditating and visualizing to be your absolute greatest potential thinking about not an Almond more on Alman less that goes into your body like on a daily basis like that obsession is fatiguing but also really beautiful thinking back and I miss it immensely but it was a huge burden and and weightlessness and victory personal victory that took a whole team to get me to that point when

[02:28:12] I arrived in Vancouver I had an incredible world Epic Games didn't actually end up winning in gold in those games but still feeling like I won and having the most consistent Olympics that are out of my life in that transition from oh seven oh eight oh nine as you're completely changing your style completely changing your body changing the way you train adjusting to a sport that is still basically and probably a profound evolution more so than a sport that's been around for hundreds of years or at least been in

[02:28:43] Olympic sport for hundred years it's still in that growth curve of figuring out the balance between technical versus strength versus power what was it like to go back to Korea in is it was a no seven you went back to live in Korea with you know seven yep and I know we sort of talked about this before but you had kind of an interesting homecoming back to Korea post o2 right right which was a no.4 we kind of glossed over that a little bit but for two years you didn't go back right yes so after the 2002 Olympic

[02:29:14] Games when I had won that gold medal in the 1500 meters and the South Korean was disqualified thus began this like really interesting relationship with the country of South Korea and I had mentioned that I was the second most hated person in South Korea first was Osama bin Laden we received 15,000 16,000 death threats via email which crashed the United States Olympic

[02:29:34] Committee servers during the Olympic Games so instantaneously we knew that that country was very unhappy with what had just happened and it was a subjective call not made by me but made by a referee who was the corner judge who decided this thing that there was a cross-tracking penalty and I was awarded could have went either way if you replay the race again with different judges so fast forward to the 2002 World Cup soccer world cup and it was Korea versus

[02:30:02] United States a Korean athlete scores the first goal rips off his jersey underneath the jersey painted on his back is my last name oh age I know oh no and they essentially do a replay of that race on the soccer field and pretend and they throw the arms up and everything basically showcasing that they think that that was a misstep in the judging call and I should not have been awarded gold so they were really fated with that result it was also a time in which I think anti-american sentiment within the country was at it's probably peak and you know a lot of people were kind of pointing fingers about things that were happening inside the country that involved Americans and could have been penalized should have been penalized for their actions in the country and they weren't and they were let off and so they thought that this was not okay and outside these decisions and courtroom areas that these things were happening but people were chanting my name as if I had anything to do with any of those incidents in any capacity so again it was a really sensitive time and it escalated even further because these death threats continued on throughout the year so much so that like my face was on toilet paper inside Korea where they were selling this and you can imagine like that's a crazy thing to have happen I had a lot of friends who were in service who in the country and they were like dude you are not liked in this country like do not come here it's not okay like people they don't even watch speed skating they don't know the sport they don't know you they just know they're supposed to hate you and so this spread this nationalism inside South

[02:31:36] Korea was always strong and they're very patriotic people and very passionate and they just they got behind this thing that I was not the good guy and we compete every single year in these World Cups right so from 2002 to 2004 we had probably three World Cups that were supposed to be in Seoul all three we opted out not to go now those are important World Cups those give you the world ranking in order to get best seated for you to world championship so it had to be pretty devastating for us to not go and we just didn't know what the threat was gonna be we didn't know if it was gonna be real we weren't we weren't certain of all it takes is one crazy person to make a you know an action and something could happen and my father definitely didn't want me to go and the only son he felt that the threat was real and he just wasn't worth it it's only sport right why would you put yourself in danger and at risk and to me

[02:32:19] I just I felt I was really hurt I think emotionally because I grew up around the Korean culture like I was obsessed with the korean skaters I had Korean coaches you know I looked up to them and Korean friends growing up and federally Washington in Seattle Washington and I ate the food I understood it and so I just felt like it was very unwarranted because they never heard my side of the story and they didn't know me a person but instead I was judged by a preconceived notion in her speculation that was inaccurate and so getting that across a huge language barrier is impossible so my only thought was well in 2004 I have to go there and so finally made the decision as a team to go to Seoul to compete and upon arrival you know we were told that the risk is still there there's gonna be bodyguards but I had no idea what to expect I'd never been in this position before and upon arrival in Incheon International

[02:33:07] Airport there was an empty baggage claim meaning they cleared out the baggage claim the area that we we arrived at and it was like a hundred to 200 maybe 300 plus security guards and police who were standing shoulder-to-shoulder to block out the Korean media when which there was like hundreds of people there and fans trying to take pictures and get interviews because it was a it was like my first time coming back so I'm like the second most hated person in the world now I'm back to compete on their home soil in their view to see who the best the best is so like this is their rematch right now it's not the Olympics but this is their rematch this is their opportunity to prove for once and for all that it was a complete fluke that I won during those games and it was the bad call and the skater that you defeated in OH - was he still skating he retired so this wasn't even really about you and him anymore this is about you in a country it was about Mena country about me versus South Korea which is really insane yeah for many levels but looking back it made me a lot stronger mentally and made me train like a complete monster every waking moment I was driven a lot by my pure fear that the guys on the other side of the world were better more prepared younger talented genetically gifted bodies suited for the sport of short track speed skating and that how can I beat them the only way I knew was just to be tougher right mentally be able to withstand pain thresholds that they would even dare step into now this is my mentality is the only way that I could make up for my lack of you know whatever god-given talents and abilities that I did or didn't have and so when I arrived in South

[02:34:51] Creon I don't tell the story often because it's never came up but the week prior we were actually in China for another World Cup and usually whenever we go to China for the World Cups they're held in like Harbin Chung turn like these north eastern regions of the country that are very cold back then they just were not nice to visit skyscrapers are being built everywhere like it's just not a pleasant place to be in during that kind of infrastructure booming period and you usually always got sick at some point like the Chinese food was just not clean or wouldn't we just didn't have the bacteria to fight and so you know me being a guy who would like eat street food sometimes when I go over there that was no longer an option and all of my team got sick during that first week and so we traveled the next week to South Korea and typically when you go to a World Cup you arrive on a

[02:35:38] Monday compete in a Friday so you spend Monday through Thursday adjusting to the climate getting used to the ice conditions understanding the environment and essentially just preparing yourself for the competition and so I was the only guy in my team who didn't get sick in China but upon that plane ride from

[02:35:57] China to South Korea my stomach was starting to feel a little funky mm-hmm talk about bad timing right I'm going to the heart of the Lions Den to be at my best this race in this competition is a World Cup it means nothing overall that year it's 2004 people don't care no one's paying attention it's so intrinsically important for me to perform well at that competition nothing else matters that year because of all of us with all these things that are encompassing and so I arrived on Monday on Tuesday I have like really bad food poisoning from China and it goes into

[02:36:31] Wednesday it goes into Thursday and at this point I'm like down 10 pounds and what's normal for the type of training you would do on the Monday Tuesday Wednesday I mean this is like kind of like a duel meet in swimming right where it's like you're not shaved you're not tapered you're just sort of going through the motions it's like it's basically a meet that's a practice would you guys be treating these meats that way more than a practice but for sure not as important as the World

[02:36:55] Championships and definitely not show so your cards you would ideally train pretty hard the wednesday-thursday yeah so we arrive on Monday we'll go for a run with the team do some skating drills and exercises Tuesday we have a harder high-intensity we'll do like five times seven laps intervals right with like four to six minutes rest in between pretty high intensity eighty to ninety percent threshold and then in the afternoon we'll do some form of a plyometric jump training and all this is by the way like fractions of what we would normally do in terms of training so this to us is a complete rest brain but you're not even able to do this based on the food poisoning or you are sort of still going through the motions of these practices

[02:37:31] I'm kind of going through the motions and by Thursday it's pretty apparent that I'm full-blown like extremely dehydrated and starting to question whether I should even compete in the competition which is like an impossible choice to face because no one's going to buy the story and the only people Aust ten pounds due to food poison yeah this story's gonna be oh you wimped out you know that you didn't win effectively your host and then you show up and compete 10 pounds dehydrated there's no weird it's lose-lose and my father was actually there too in South Korea because he was really scared of lying to my well-being and you know I was just assigned two bodyguards to follow me on the whole competition and the entire time and I remember walking in on Friday the first day of competition and getting on the ice and hearing all of the Korean fans literally booing and just you know I don't know what they're saying and cream but I'm sure something like like you know it's probably not nice it's not nice you know definitely take me out of the game and you know I performed okay actually the first day I did not bad and there's something about and I'd loved to really understand the science behind us because I've had this repetition time and time again whenever I got sick in my sport I always perform pretty well for whatever reason even through time trials do you think it just has to do with the four stressed that comes before it maybe four stressed maybe the white blood cell count is a component who knows what's really there maybe the immune systems working overtime I don't know but I mean

[02:38:55] I'm exhausted I feel terrible but for some reason my output is still very very very high this time was different because I pretty lean already you drop all that water right I was drinking water he was coming right out ten minutes later like literally he was just severe nasty food poisoning that lasted about three and a half days and so you know I get through the first day

[02:39:16] I get through Saturday the 500 meters I was pretty much useless in the sprints for whatever reason just had no strength you know in between races on Sunday which is a thousand meters and the 3,000 meters I'm like lying on the floor you know like just trying to rest and I ended up actually somehow just doing very well at that competition end up winning the thousand meter winning the 3000 meter so that meant this is

[02:39:37] Saturday so I'm this is Sunday so on Sunday is the big day which means you skate the thousand meter and the 3,000 meter super final and in the relay on the same day that's how the World Cup schedule usually works it doesn't work that way in the Olympics but it's very very different and so I skated very well and I'm winning the competition on the home soil so what how did the fans react to this well you know when I first got on on Friday they were all booing and by the time I left I would say 80% of them actually we're clapping and they were cheering and someone had leaked to the media that I was really sick during that time and I think that had a component of that a people people understood that I actually was performing at subpar optimal levels and I still was able to somehow pull it off and it was really mentally excruciating because I very much wanted to win but not because I wanted to beat them but because I just I wanted to prove I gave to me it was it was like look I'm Luke like I am a competitive athlete who on any given

[02:40:32] Sunday can win may not win every ten times but I'll win at least one of those ten times right and I wanted to showcase that and just kind of searching and you know reaching for respect because I didn't get that when I first arrived like it was like basically you know the thought process was you did not deserve to win and you cheated to win and I didn't feel like I did and so the only way to retract those statements from those people who were making them was to try to go there and win wholeheartedly openly and I did in that manner and so that was that was the first change in our relationship in terms of being the most hated to having respect for me as an athlete as a sportsman to actually like going to the airport and people having like fan club signs and this happened within the same trip this happened the same training you describe your arrival but by the time you departed the same Korean fans were cheering for you the same your fans were cheering for me in the airport yep both sides and I remember the the head of KSU at the time mr. Chang came to me he's like

[02:41:32] I don't know what you did or how you did it but you're leaving here in a much better place than you did when you arrived which is awesome you know because that was the actual goal my goal was not to defeat really them but to just show them that I'm to earn their respect yep that's that's what it came down to and it did it in a convincing fashion so it was it was awesome so between o4 and O 7 you've obviously gone back to the Olympics you've demonstrated that this isn't some fluke you've earned their respect and now when

[02:42:01] I was 7 you're going one to actually train with them as you try to come back and make the Olympic team in 2010 yep so again I kind of go back and do the the belly of the beast I go back to the place where no other and they're embracing you now in Asia but they're also at the time the South Korean short track team was very very fenced off from the rest of the world in terms of their training methods that was their secret sauce it was we don't understand why they're so good how do they get that technique how do they they don't lift weights we hear but they're so good we watched them during training and it looks like they're over drinking their bodies look like I mean designed for short track if you could be God and you could make a perfect short track skater tell me what their body looks like so you take your pelvis tilt it forward so the complete opposite of what you do in a squat do the complete opposite tilt your pelvis forward okay and so your lower back is now rounded have a shorter torso longer legs thinner and frame naturally and basically zero upper body weight because then you can strengthen your lower body very easily that sounds like a cyclist yeah that's the tilt you put into a cyclists thoracolumbar spine yeah no upper body all lower body that's how you design it and very and strength to weight ratio that's strange the charts yeah that's the perfect speed ski and there's a few that exists I actually wasn't one of them my proportions are actually live but my legs a little bit too short my torch is a little bit too long and you're pretty muscular all around like you don't have that emaciated upper body no I didn't naturally but the South

[02:43:32] Korean athletes men and women had this naturally and so when I watched them skate I recognized right away it was like these guys aren't thinking about their technique when they're going to the corner its natural like that they're just skating it's like walking you don't think about left right left right you just walk when you go for a job the same thing you're not thinking about which foot is in for the other that's what it's like when you don't understand speed skating is you're thinking let me tilt my left hip in let me put my right shoulder down maybe make sure that my shoulders and my hips are level with the ice no matter what angle I'm skating at make sure my nose knees and toes are in inline at all times in all periods like

[02:44:07] I'm thinking about these things every corner because it's not natural really even I mean I remember you once telling me if the funniest thing about how you would drive to the rink in that position yeah is obsessed I mean of course we can't do it on the podcast because we don't we don't the visual but like the image of you tilting yourself over the steering wheel driving that way to mimic the corner it never became autonomic you never got to the point where you could make that turn and perfectly line up without a single thought I trained myself to do it automatically but I don't think it was a natural feeling for me it took years and hours and hours of obsessive driving with like all the weight on my right hip with my left hip you know like imagine driving and you put all the weight on your right leg and your left leg is not even touching the ground okay and your left hip is actually raised a little bit and your left hand is on the steering wheel and your right shoulder is down like that's an uncomfortable position to be in every single day to and from the ice rink and

[02:45:08] I did it because I want I just wanted to feel natural I wanted to skate as natural as I saw the other skaters skating I love this kind of stuff I mean that's what I sort of enjoy about having a discussion like this is I think so many people if they're sort of watching you on TV or they're watching Phelps or they're watching Lance Armstrong or they're watching you know pick whatever great athlete I think people just assume like it just came so easy to them and but I don't think they realized that the best of the best have this ability to force themselves to do this type of work which is not to say that there isn't a natural talent I think the best of the best combined natural talent with sort of you know whatever antha but you know you don't even have the same sort of physical dimension advantage that some of your peers would have but it's this complete obsession it's this like who would even think you're gonna use the extra hour a day I'm driving to Train speed skating yeah it's all I cared about it's all that that was important it's all that mattered in my life and when you prioritize that as being the sole significant piece of your life from waking moment until you close your eyes and hopefully when you're sleeping you're thinking bout it too it changes your perspective on how you live your life and what actually you do on a daily basis to impact you I mean I want to come back to finish your career but I can't help but at the moment ask a question that I'm afraid I'll forget to ask if we go back to the Olympics which is now that you're not a professional athlete do you still have that level of focus or is that something that is very difficult to maintain for you know a prolonged period of time in other words do you now relish the fact that you didn't have to think about what we had for dinner like you could eat as much as you wanted and you can now sit here comfortably and like you know you're gonna drive home tonight and you're not gonna have to contort yourself into some crazy position I mean what's the new guidance system you've applied to the missile that is your life it definitely have the same I think quirks that I did from sport that are transferring over to my life I now recognize them you know when I was training as an athlete I didn't recognize him I didn't know what they were I just thought that that's what I did this is the things that me driving in that way to the ice rink was normal that's not normal any that's not even normal for an athlete it's really not by borderline unhealthy psychologically to be that obsessed at that level all the time there wasn't one day I went to the ice rink I didn't wake up and didn't want to be there cuz I was it wasn't a choice there was no do I want to go to or not that was even a conversation so now considering the different projects that

[02:47:46] I have and delving into areas where I don't have the experience I don't have the time spent and education it really helps because I completely immerse and I spend hours and hours and hours on certain elements is it in the same intensity probably not it's difficult to relate that in the same way but for sure the traits and attributes that I developed as a short track athlete for absolutely sure they are beneficial attributes to apply towards specific parts of life and also just the fact of feeling like when you look at life no matter how bad gets you can always come back no matter how sick no matter how tired I am like I was able to compete right I was able to train now in doing business or relationships taking the same kind of mentality of saying like I've done things physiologically I never thought was possible I broke through barriers mentally that I think were really powerful and how do you apply those with an open mind and with a way that's a different perspective on life

[02:48:48] I'm much softer as a person now than I was back then I was so rigid in every element you can imagine and tight actually with my time with the way that I viewed I think the world would the way I have viewed my teammates it made me probably unpleasant to be around on the ice most of the time because I just didn't I wasn't there to make food you have significant relationships with you know a girlfriend or something during that period of your life kind of off and on but none that really were know nothing that I would really say like this was you know not like what you and not like what you enjoy today no totally different but my view is different my life really kind of began after I retired from the sport I learned so much through it but I really recognized that my life began when I decided to not come back to the sport and it was really beautiful to be able to do that why is it that many athletes can't articulate what you just said on two levels the first being I'm amazed at the number of athletes that I meet who once they're done with their sport they can't seem to apply that greatness to the next chapter in other words they've clearly worked hard they've clearly learned to do something well even when no one's looking because that's basically what most of practice is but they really struggle to make that leap and then secondly for many athletes sadly once the lights are gone once nobody knows your name there seems to be this depression that sets in and maybe depression might be too far on the pendulum but there's this sense of their their purpose is over right they don't think about what that next tract looks like did you struggle with any of those things at all and everybody just seeing you now on the other side of that where it's it looks like everything's worked out I mean was there ever a challenge where you thought oh my god I don't ever get to carry a flag I don't ever get to put a medal on my neck

[02:50:38] I don't ever get to be on TV for being the best athlete or something I mean was that a transition it was an incredibly difficult transition and one that I I don't talk about that much but I don't care who you are and I heard a podcast I'm gonna say like a couple years ago which I really resonated with it and it was talking about seals coming home from war and feeling so out of place in normal society that they can't wait to go back I think they love war they hate war they don't like what it is but they probably love the purpose they have them robbery in the purpose and they feel like this is what they're supposed to do there's a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose like you said in the Olympic space you have one single focus for a long time for eight 12 years nothing in your life matters more than that sport and everything you do is generate it to be important in that sport and if you win you're celebrated which makes it even more dangerous because now there's a level of expectation that you are gonna carry this flag further and like you said there's a ton of attributes you create as an athlete that are incredible life lessons that you learn through sport they're amazing the problem is when you retire from an athlete you've now dedicated most of your adult life towards this one specific task that has absolutely zero relevancy to life I went in circles in spandex for most of my adult life well most of my younger adult life right and now I retired I didn't in turn I wasn't working at Goldman Sachs as a finance guy I don't have experience working as a job and now I'm thrust in the spotlight to go and basically act and interact in normal society if you didn't make money you didn't win medals then what do you do like you basically you sacrifice it the first twelve years of your life that you normally from the age of 18 to 28 those are so incredibly important to gain expertise and experience and social skills and personal development and try anything that you want and failed them is still K and get back up you didn't have that opportunity you're now starting out as an eighteen year old but you're now 28 years old right and so that's the challenge is from a competitive perspective when you've got a corporate entity looking at hiring or perhaps you want to get a new job like hey that's great you got you're an

[02:52:50] Olympic athlete I know you probably work hard I know that you probably spent a lot of time doing this this and this but you've got zero work experience you didn't finish college you don't have any idea what it takes to be here like maybe I'll take a risk on you maybe I won't it's a difficult position being but on top of all of that stuff you have to look at the actual psychological issues that exist and that's where it really really gets dark

[02:53:12] I'm not excluded from that I was so fearful in 2008 that when I retired in 2010 I wouldn't find my place I wouldn't find my running start I didn't want to go from 2010 retire 2014 or 2013 say I'm coming out of retirement I want to go for another Games I never wanted that to be me and I said as soon as I retired I really really want to walk away because

[02:53:37] I'm doing something else but I want to win at something else that's completely unrelated to speed skating it's unrelated to the Olympics pace so it's almost like a chip on your shoulder not everyone is like that but that was my perspective and you know a lot of athletes when they retire like literally

[02:53:52] I got a snap of a finger when they come home from the Olympic Games there's no coach there's no training program there's no cafeteria there's no there's there's no more structure and schedule that has been kind of given to you in a way that's pretty easy to follow you just you wake up you go the ice rink you train you come home you eat you focus on skating tape sharpen your skates go back to the ice rink train again excite excited it's very mundane but specific but pretty easy to follow it's simple I'd say not easy it's simple that's a great point right there's a big differentiation between simple and easy there's nothing easy about it but there's a beauty to being able to focus on one thing at the exclusion of pretty much everything else yeah and now you wake up and ma'am what do I do like how important is money how important is having a family how important our relationships how important is personal self-development how is my nutrition do I even understand nutrition everyone my nutritionist gave me the food to eat do I go for runs do I work out like so I see a lot of athletes because they're much effort around preparing athletes for that transition in retirement there used to be I don't know what it's like now I think there's probably more of an emphasis now but they always look people always tell you look your Olympic career will end at some point and you have to be prepared for the transition we used to do these things called usoc summits in which two years before the Olympics you would go to a winter destination for example we would go to we would go to Park City and then all the Olympic hopefuls and existing

[02:55:26] Olympic athletes in the past two or three generations would come Eric I don't be there Bonnie Blair be there done Dan Jannsen would be there Michelle Kwan these people would be there and you basically would talk about what it takes to train for the next two years and then what to do before during and after the

[02:55:42] Olympics the issue is no one really takes it seriously because you have this invincibility complex that you know what I'm not gonna get hurt sure like I'm just I'm just gonna keep skating until I die and I was naive enough remember I made some bad decisions as an athlete you know I told you pretty early I was asked at the age of seventeen at one of these summits two years probably games I said like a public what do you want to be remembered for and I wrote down like I want to be the most decorated Winter Olympic athlete of all time the greatest speed skater who have ever lived in short-track speedskating and they put that in a Steiner Ice Arena in Utah I forgot about this but the things that I learned there were so important but people could tell me all the time and someone asked me like what do you want to do in retire I was I go to me when I retire like I was built for this sport

[02:56:24] I'm supposed to be here to motivate other human beings throughout my actions on the ice it's very naive to say and I did some reason I just thought that it was okay to live that life it was like I didn't have a parachute I lived that way in speed skating on one side it's beautiful because there is no plan B and when there's no plan B you really commit to plan a hey you better make the planning is gonna be executed so that's the burning of the ships right yeah you burn the ships so you can't leave the island but again there's still something here there's a difference right between people who seem to get more out of the sport it's almost like they're actively versus passively participating in the process right you can very passively participate I suspect where you follow the lessons and you go through the motions of doing everything you need to do for the sport versus I think a more active way of doing that and I say active in an emotional way not a physical way obviously both examples are physically active but to be emotionally active through that process I suspect you are whether consciously or subconsciously assimilating the knowledge the skill the failure the discipline into what could be the next chapter so let's go back and finish how does the story end its Oh 8 its own 9 so

[02:57:43] Oh 9 is really the last major competition before the Olympics right it's the world silver World Championships they're being held in Beijing and I'm competing and there's one other u.s. short track athlete who was my junior he started speed skating because he watched me in 2002 now we're competing on the same team he's from the same area I grew up in I used to be his idol and I always I always used to look at this kid like this kids a lot better than it actually realizes once he realizes how good he is he's potentially gonna be world champion or Olympic gold medalist and in and throughout this process at the World Championships I just performed sub-optimally I wasn't a major contender I wasn't a top-tier guy to win I wasn't on top of the podium I think I got like fifth at the world in the world you know 9 yep I gotta go back and check but it was the first time I watched from the bet you know after the competition with a banquet although adding to their everyone's getting awarded you go in the podium getting your checks and it was the first time in a long time that I wasn't didn't have the spotlight I wasn't the guy that people were talking man that raced all that pass oh my god so powerful like it was not about me and I was a oh man this is this is weird is this what it's supposed to be like do I just to dissipate and just kind of wither away and I used to be good and I'm still respected but just don't have what it takes anymore to be competitive and I'm kind of losing that edge and I can't keep up with the evolution of what's happening in short track because the body types are changing and the training is changing the athletes are changing and so I left they're really really really worried and upset and also hearing that chatter again about I don't think that Paulo is gonna be actually on the podium in 2010 which is a big different conversation you know I've been at that level for ten years now at the top top top of my game in year 2000 2001 season I want every single race that season and both the Korean athlete who I you know had that tussle with and that mark Danielle character from Quebec both camp me during that race it was like you are the greatest athlete to compete in short-track speedskating like two champions that I look up to and adelies said that to me too now being at a point where no was not even on the podium I'm on the podium but not only that people aren't even taking my lap times during practice anymore well so like this is psychologically damaging because from a confidence perspective you rage differently and I started to recognize it other athletes aren't respecting me on the ice the same way they used to I used to be able to actually have an off day but if I just kind of attempted a pass at someone they just let me in because there was so much respect for what I had done in the sport before that no longer existed people skated as if I which is like a random skater he's so this huge psychological advantage he brought to the start line was gone was gone and so it really made me dive deep and say okay like look this is my last chance at really trying to show up differently and I think that you know my Korean coach that hadn't been telling me to like look the Korean coaches themselves they know you so well they studied you from 2002 until today you're the only thing that mattered to them so they they watched every single race you've ever skated time and time again and they have ponds in their skating rinks to basically mimic your skating just like a boxing like your sparring partner so they have guys who try to mimic the way that you skate in that style so they can practice against you every single day I don't we have that we didn't think about it like that they were they were a different level and so I went back to my house in in Utah and I said man I'm gonna go back to kind of where I developed my strength and I said I'm gonna go spend a summer in Colorado Springs alone I drove there was there some part that thought maybe I should just retire because it's one thing to go through what you went through it would be entirely another thing to fail on the Olympic stage yeah

[03:01:42] I didn't want to give up that's for sure I still believed this is interesting I mean let's explore that for a moment because I gotta be honest with you man I don't know that I would have had the intestinal fortitude to continue if I if I really felt like I'm on the decline and every day I'm getting a little less good yeah and everybody around me is getting a little bit better I don't know maybe that's why I'm not limping champion like I mean that's that's kind of a remarkable inner confidence and did you explicitly or implicitly tie that back to some of these other difficult things you'd been through including and thrown out in the woods when you were in the summer of 98 and things like that I did but you know again you're like did you talk about this with your dad I mean who I did I did extensively he was my confidante and there's three people my life who were my confident it was my dad when my best friend's in Baranski who was basically living in my house in Utah is like a training partner and then John

[03:02:34] Shaffer the guy who I brought in to live and trained me during that period of time those are the three people who I really really had conversations with John is the most optimistic positive person on the planet like there's nothing he believes that can't be accomplished through strength and focus and so his thought it was up doesn't matter you're gonna come back you're gonna crush everybody you go smash it you're gonna skeet lap times that don't exist you know my dad's more realist ian is a very very very strong different view he's much more of a realist and you know he says what was the view between the three of them my dad didn't we have an opinion right he's more just like look I support what you had to do to make sure you you really go through the drawing board and develop a plan and that was a different person than somebody I was I think he's happy to see me but he also recognized that it was not gonna be easy John what the time was like well you know I think there's just a possible you can still win every single distance in the world and he won't lose and they'll pick here you know that's his his attitude which I needed to have that around because I'm not naturally that type of person

[03:03:28] Ian's winning you naturally don't have that much confidence I have confidence but it's different like I definitely it sound like I walk in and say I can't lose there was times right when my equipment was on point like earlier in my career was like I could fall down like I still win this race like no one's gonna beat me I'm just that much better nobody else but at this point you know I was battling some small injuries and some equipment issues and nothing was quite right so I never felt like I was a hundred percent like maybe eighty percent of time so the one person I feel like really knew me was my friend Ian

[03:03:53] Baranski you know to give you kinda some backstory like as a short track public athlete you never show your cards even to your teammates because I eventually you race against in the Olympic Trials right so you kind of show that you always hold something back and so I was really really good at that so people didn't really know like what was going on internally they decide that I was like this stoic never show pain incredibly focused super hungry quiet kind of crazy guy who just comes the rink with an insatiable appetite for pain and training every day like with like a complete robot like that's that's who Apollo is and that's what I wanted the people to believe right the reality was and who I would I needed somebody to kind of confide in it was it was Ian my close friend and you know Ian was my first roommate when I was traveling on all these music when I was 12 and 13 years old so he knew me from when I started til to this point and he basically was like look you are not the same athlete you used to be like you're actually even though you have the same recipe for success you're just not the same you're older man like your body's stiffer you don't skate the same you don't look the same your equipments a little bit different the other athletes are changing the sport is changing and you know he's keeping it real right someone has to and so I kind of went back I'm like man like how do I in my view like all these years spent training still only matters on this one day in the Olympics like none of this stuff matters my previous wins in my own head my previous wins don't matter I keep my medals inside my sock drawer in my house

[03:05:21] I never bring him out I don't want to think about that I want I want to think about I'm the underdog every day so I said I gotta make some huge huge changes and so I a week after the World Championships I'm back in Salt Lake City and normally you take like a decompression period and you really really think about things and I was gonna stay there for about a month and then potentially go somewhere else to

[03:05:40] Train I pack my bags like one day and I just left and I drove all the way to Colorado Springs checked myself into the Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center and began training so the Olympic team moved from Colorado Springs to Salt Lake City in 2007 to Train so the speed skaters are no longer in Colorado Springs of a train Center so when I arrived back there 2009 I was the only guy there everyone else was off training in in in

[03:06:04] Utah or wherever else and I brought my bike and I basically set up a little training plan I just trained Solo and this is like February March of o.9 yeah this is like February March April May I think I first saw the team again like the end of May and I spent that entire time and like essentially completes all to just training by myself and I just you know I you know I just like anything else and you analyze the situation what are the goals what are you trying to do what type of training in need and mine wasn't based solely on sports science because I didn't seek that route I probably should've but I didn't seek that route I just said okay gotta improve cadence gotta lower the body weight maintain strength but really have to just get an incredible aerobic base shape like you've never been before and that's gonna carry you throughout the rest of the year so that you won't have issues with burnout or you know with any overtraining and do you develop at aerobic base on the bike or on the track or well we don't skate in the summer that much we don't skate to the end of May so that period off so it's on a bike it's on a bike it's on inline skates it's running it's with treadmill it's with

[03:07:07] Stairmaster but it's really spent a lot of time for me I use the Manitou incline in Colorado Springs were just like this far the roads one mile of cog railroad steps that go up and that was my that was my sanctuary like I lived on that thing so many times a week I used to go up it with weight vests and jumps and you know you can't beat that thing it's just one of those elements where you just get a little bit faster at it and you get easier to compensate but you hurt just the same no matter how fast or slow you go and so it's the fastest time you could make it up that I was like 17 36 or 1738 which is fast and obviously lots of athletes do this right there's not just the skaters yeah a lot of athletes I would say the average time is probably 20 to 24 between there and that 17 and a half minutes was not with the 40 pound weight vest is no no

[03:07:54] Queen I needed to go back to that space again of like this is where I started how much of that training do you think was for your brain versus your body 90% 95% I was probably doing everything wrong to be completely honest with you there's no reason why I should be going for a 3 hour bike ride my races lasts no more than two and a half minutes and of those two and a half minutes I'm probably only really skating for a min and a half I mean half hour bike rides going up and down like the canyons they're important maybe you go a couple of those rides but you don't need that I should be doing specified interval training according to the time that's under duration and you can extend that but I shouldn't be spinning my wheels for hours at a time but what did I gain a mental perspective and a honed focus and a resiliency and the feeling that I was reinventing myself was really important to me psychologically so I would walk on the ice differently I would walk into the ice rink differently

[03:08:48] I would project a different type of energy upon my opponents and other skaters and my conference that will be higher so that's what I went after and it wasn't until I came back to Selleck City and invited John Schaefer back into my home until he said look no more of these two-hour runs like what are you doing this is like so 1960 like you're wasting your time and you're actually training the Sprint out of your body which is her biggest strength and then I kind of explained to him my goals and we began that journey towards shedding all that weight and it was excruciating and so how the story ends is arrived in

[03:09:22] Vancouver BC 2010 and going into the Olympic Trials had you gotten back in enough shape that most people felt like you'd make the team yeah everyone knew I'd make the team it wouldn't be as dominant as they normally would be but for sure I'd make the team so that's a big improvement over where you were at the worlds earlier in the year yeah I think so I definitely came a long way and technically I had improved a lot and people had seen some big changes in my body and going into Vancouver you've already figured out like this is your last Olympics internally I didn't tell you about him internally I've always wondered what it felt like for multiple

[03:09:54] Olympians like you know when Phelps rolled into Rio how bittersweet it is in a way cuz they I don't know like do they appreciate it more then or the first time because you'd think well the first taste of this is the greatest but perhaps in some of the I'll give you another example that's totally unrelated like I have three kids right and you've met them all and I remember when the first one's born I'm thinking this is the greatest thing in the world and now our third one you kind of know it's your last one in some ways I think

[03:10:24] I'm actually enjoying it even more like changing the diaper is like you know what there's gonna be day when I don't get to do this anymore and so did you have that sort of feeling when you walk into the opening ceremony one you're being probably looked at now as the leader of the team right you're certainly one of the leaders of the team just from maturity standpoint and experience standpoint and you also know inside like hey I don't get to put this uniform on and walk into this opening ceremony again this is really the last hurrah for this chapter of my life it's an absolute greater sense of appreciation for what you're doing and also that you know that this is this is it and I'm older more mature I can appreciate the process that I've been through I've got scars I've got wins and losses mentally you've gone through a lot you spend a lot of time alone so you've battled your own internal insecurities and demons and self doubts and now you're at a place where you feel like you've you've experienced a lot so to me the last games was the best for sure when the first Olympics was incredible never take it away but I was so young difficult to absorb that type of information that rate of speed which you've never had access to before 2006 different environment different games been through it one time understand it I know how to do this I know how to handle a pressure I know what the sounds are like go through the process the last one you go walk into the arena you hear the sound and it sounds awesome just you have a greater sense of appreciation and also you're just really focused on just trying to be your absolute best so it's not like you're there to experience the moment because you just don't have time to write you're you're there for a specific task and a goal and unfortunately that detracts away from your time to be present and experience the Olympic Games for what we see them as it's amazing production of the world coming together compete we go there and it's just like I'm ice rink Olympic

[03:12:18] Village ice rink Olympic Village ice rink Olympic Village rest recovery massage sharpen skates game time that's a recipe right there yeah in many ways you do as a spectator or even feel bad for the favorites because it's a totally different experience in swimming for example like usually to meet kicks off with the 400 IM and so if you're a favorite to win the 400 I am I'm not even sure if you're showing up to the opening ceremonies you're not you're absolutely not yeah I mean it's like whereas if you're not a favorite if you're like not even gonna make it out of the first heat you're gonna go to the opening ceremonies because that is part of like that is the experience right I can go open Saturdays you probably don't have a drink yeah so it's important to keep in mind like the sacrifice that has to be made if you really want to win using that very specific example it's a moment in time right so as much as you want to have fun and go talk to their athletes and mingle with the different cultures and community you've trained your entire life for these two weeks and you are not gonna allow one slip-up to detract away from that in these two weeks and it's funny because when you're four years away from a game it's like when it's 2006 oh man I'm four years away this is gonna take forever you know like this is yeah

[03:13:30] I know I hear when says it's gonna be here before I know it and then two weeks during those games you're like man I wish I had another year of training mm-hmm you're not saying that in 2006 you know you're wishing like it the games were in a year or two and so it's a different perspective but I arrived and I hit my goal set and in terms my weight and my my cadence and the first check mark for me was when I got on the ice in Vancouver and the Chinese coaches are there the Canadian coaches are there the Russian coaches are there all the coaches from the different teams are there and they're videotaping our practice as they are everyone else's practice because the first look at seeing which shape you're in did he change anything since the last World Cup there's your body weight different are your equipment different what are you doing differently and the first thing that we heard via the chatter that was going on was like we don't even recognize Apollo this guy we trained to beat he didn't show up yeah got a new guy a new guy new guy with a new cadence a new rhythm a new style of training a new style of of racing a new technique was different that's exactly what we wanted to do and had an incredible team to help support that not only my strength coach John Shaffer but the rest of the Olympic team and make teammates too or a huge part of that right because we trained every single day together and it's a really really powerful feeling to be able to show up and like to me that was the win actually it was it before I raced I was a man like I went through this I took a huge gamble I wasn't sure if it was gonna work I think it did I feel like it did everyone else is saying like I did my coaches are beyond happy they can't believe what we just accomplished and I haven't raced the race yet that's a very powerful feeling to go into your first race with and then from there it's like look I've done the work there's nothing more I could have done I wouldn't change anything and it's time to just focus on strategy and compete and I add up winning another three medal at those games and retiring with eight medals were you sad or happy at the closing ceremonies was it I was both I was both sad unhappy you know I couldn't believe that my my life had turned into this direction I couldn't believe that I'd spent this much time dedicated towards a sport I couldn't believe the amount of press and interest that we were getting from a crazy sport like short-track speedskating and just feeling grateful and then also kind of promising myself there like hey like any opportunity that comes your way you weren't gonna say yes no matter what for the next year and then thus began when I walked off the plane from Vancouver

[03:15:52] I like wasn't in one place for more than two or three days just bouncing around from speaking engagement to appearance to meeting to sponsor plated stuff and it was incredible your sponsors by the end of the 2010 Olympics who were your main sponsors I had Alaska Airlines we had Omega subway was still subway was yes that year coca-cola was a sponsor is a few others but those are the majorette sponsors and when did you announce your retirement announcer over time in 2012 publicly but I knew May I knew in 2009 this was my last games it was just one of those things where I I was happy and

[03:16:29] I was I really wanted to complete the game like I you always talk about that right but like I never wanted to come back I never wanted to finish my career feeling like I was missing something like I want like I had an itch I wanted I didn't want to be going down the line working on some new app and be like man

[03:16:43] I think I'm gonna come about retirement and I had that feeling watching Phelps in 2012 during the London Olympics you had that feeling for him or you're so myself to wonder like man I'm still in great shape I still feel really healthy I know a lot more about myself nutrition technique training than I ever did I'm pretty sure I can make this team and I'm pretty sure I can be competitive in the

[03:17:05] Sochi Olympics in two years and then so instead of that I had that conversation with myself internally while doing commentary in NBC Olympic Games while interviewing Phelps at his first press conference and talking to about the pressures of being so successful how does he maintain you know like his sense of in 2012 was a very difficult Olympics for Michael I mean I don't know him of course but I just I know enough about swimming to be able to watch and read between the lines but when Thea's going through a lot there's only two events he entered in the Olympics where he didn't win a medal the first was that fifth place finish in the 200 fly yeah as a 15 year old boy in 2000 and Cindy but what a lot of people forget is he finished fourth in the 400 I am his signature event in London yeah and that's a race that if I recall I mean at the time locked he was probably the best 400 I am er in the world but Michael had done really well in the trials and basically touched out another swimmer that most people thought was gonna get that spot but then kind of faded at the back of the 400 IM didn't look like himself no didn't at all and i've always thought it was sort of inside baseball minutiae if

[03:18:11] I were to say lake has a swim fan what were the greatest Phelps performances of all time I'll tell you what is number one his anchoring the four by 100 relay right after his abysmal performance and I use abysmal in quotes but for Phelps his abysmal performance in the 400 I am and I remember watching that race thinking oh my god this could shatter his confidence for the rest of the meet and then he shows up in the next race the four by 100 free relay and crushes the anchor I crushes the leadoff leg there's a backstory to what happened in the anchor of that and they didn't end up winning the gold but that was one of his most remarkable performances but overall that

[03:18:55] Olympics was sort of sad for me watch films because I felt like God like he's not the same swimmer he was he got touched in the 200 fly and all these other things so what was that like for you both talking to him about it but also just now thinking wait a minute should I be doing this again you're going through this process of what you didn't want to do I didn't want to do that and I was having that conversation you know I had some friends who like they always thought that I retired too early they were like man you still got another four years cuz you were what 29 at this point it's 28 yeah yes I was young by the way looking at Michael and seeing him by the way in that race directed anger and rage is very powerful and

[03:19:39] Michael swims very well when he's angry very well and he needs to you saw that between the 400 IM and the 4 by1 because I was very similar I needed to have like if I was winning too often like I needed to throw in a little self-sabotage no monkey wrench in there to lose a race and then get that feeling of get that feeling of losing and like us I do I forgot what that tasted like I think

[03:20:03] Michael won so easy for so long you know like it's difficult to push yourself when no one else is it's only you out there and you can win if you're 70 percent right so and he's so incredibly talented it's that that's what I saw and I'm it's wrong that's my view and so when I was watching that and I said you know I'm not gonna make a decision here so I came back home I went to that same place mo clips in iron springs resort and I said I'm gonna really think about this and make a real decision on whether

[03:20:30] I want to do and I said you know what I'm not gonna go back I'm gonna continue on this path of trying to become an entrepreneur and trying to learn and explore and grow as a human and that's what I'm gonna commit to and I'm not gonna listen to this short-sighted wants of wanting to relive in those Olympic moments again because I think a lot of that's what it comes from it's like you know two years out from the games although I'm there I'm on the other side of the lens for the first time ever and it's a different feeling and I want to be the guy on the start line in that fourth and fifth Lane getting ready to go I want to be one of the favorites to win the race and I want that pressure I want that moment of okay the curtain is open it's do-or-die like you either perform you don't the paper is never gonna lie at the other day and you don't get that anymore you do if you have a different perspective in terms of business and opportunities but as athlete it feels different doesn't matter how which way you chop it up so I'm glad I made the right decision I decided not to go back to the sport and I was gonna pursue different opportunities and different different things in my life and that was a decision I made and I'm still happy about doing that god it's such an amazing journey because you know I've known quite a bit about you before we spoke today but I didn't realize I think all of the internal struggle I think it's just so easy to kind of look at athletes and look at the ones who have done so well and assume that it was always clear in their mind that they were gonna win and they just executed and you don't realize the best athletes are still humans which means they still come with all the doubts that the rest of us have and the the self-loathing and the shame or the in some ways perhaps even perverse incentives you know I can't help but hear your story and wonder how much of this was sort of you needing to prove yourself to someone to something from the moment we talked about you know your mom not being there

[03:22:20] I've always wondered is like is there something about you wanting to demonstrate to her like hey I'm worth it like I was you know I was an amazing kid and that may be too obvious a statement right maybe that maybe that never even factored into any of this stuff subconsciously but you were a very driven kid from the beginning I describe these are like missiles without guidance systems those are still good things to have like it's great to be a missile that just needs a guidance system right when you think now I mean where do you want to be in ten years obvious it's gonna be mostly business-related I think it you know we were talking about it over dinner like it's not like you necessarily want to go back to coaching skating or something which is unfortunate because I think in many ways you could bring so much to that sport if unfortunately for the sport not for you that you could bring so much knowledge as you've said like your knowledge of nutrition and training and specificity today is so much beyond what you had at the time yeah but let's just pause it for a moment that you're not going to become the head coach of the US speed skating team where do you want to be in ten years ten years I want to be

[03:23:23] I think first and foremost healthy I want to have increased my personal relationships with my close family and friends made new ones along the way increase the amount of experiences that we've shared together business I think that I'll always have an urge to be involved in different projects and different ideas and whether they succeed or fail I want to win but I don't think it's necessary that's the the real importance is that I go through those processes and hopefully I learn and apply those lessons at the next business opportunity or the next venture or path that I'm doing and I think least my father told me at one point he's like you know Apollo in your mid-thirties into your early 40s you will become significantly more self reflective and inquisitive of many questions my father is a very curious person as am I and so like these questions come up in my life that I never asked when I was an athlete like what is really important what do I really care about we were talking about like watches and these these things that have like limitless acquisition opportunity where does some of these things really play a role in my life in the long term and what do I really need that really makes me happy and you know

[03:24:39] I feel really blessed to have had both incredible wins in my life both on the field of play and off the field to play and also I'm really blessed and have gratitude for the incredible stupid mistakes that I've made and losses that I've created both on and off the field to play either do business and relationships in the way that I acted or whatever I am human like anyone else

[03:25:03] I've developed super human-like attributes associated with this sport as with anyone would who dedicated a lifetime of achievement towards something maybe they wouldn't be an Olympic champion maybe but they would be very very good at that thing and I think that I've just I've realized that the things that make me really happy that's pretty small list and I feel really really grateful and happy to have recognized that at the age of 36 and I want to continue that and I want to continue to explore I want to continue to learn and hopefully I can give back and and teach the next generation of kids and people whether they want to be an athlete or not I believe that everyone should be playing sports in some capacity and regardless of your output or your skill set I think there's amazing life lessons that are learned about how to win how to lose and just like I went through about committing and dedicating and sacrificing and going to the physical pains you have to go through I think there's really powerful things even if you just suck and you're the last guy pic that doesn't really matter there's things that you learned through that process I think they're difficult to teach if you don't have the physical component that's associated and so I think about that often as I you know every year that goes by I'm eight years retired now from the sport of short-track speedskating I have no desire to go back I love going to every

[03:26:20] Olympic Games and commentating I feel out my element it's a it's a homecoming and reunion for me to see all my old friends and so see it's and I keep tabs in the race and sometimes I watch speed skating tapes until 4:30 in the morning and realize I could dude this doesn't matter anymore like put it away you know and then also just just trying to find out and understand more about myself and

[03:26:41] I think that's really interesting and so you know I've gained a lot from just spending time and learning from people who who I don't consider to be if you ask me younger when I was younger experts in their field but now I've had a much more open mind I've learned a lot from you I've learned a lot from a lot of the people that you you are friends with a lot easier than podcast and the you know the advent of Technology and access to information is so incredible you know when I went on my first Olympic

[03:27:09] Games we didn't have Instagram like people were barely using their phones in the same degree that we were doing today so like your access the internet was just a Google a couple of ideas but that's pretty the bare bare minimum if you're creating content you were one of the very few right and so I just I think it's really interesting and I've been traveling around the world yeah your travel schedule is worse than mine and I

[03:27:30] I tend to lament my travel schedule but yeah yours is I mean you're really never in the same place more than two or three weeks right yeah this is probably the longest I've been in one place in the US and actually in years so I'm actually really enjoying it I've been spending a lot of my time but 80% of my time in Asia and my routine is pretty aggressive I've always had a fascination with Asia in general both the food the culture the people the diversity the growth the opportunities that exist there but you still don't speak Japanese fluently I know I speak more Korean than I do

[03:28:03] Japanese and I think this is a byproduct of me being I just have to introduce you to Tim Ferriss because he will be able to teach you Japanese in a shorter period of time that I'm convinced anybody could teach that's right that's right that's his amazing ability to deconstruct world-class people Japanese was the first language he learned outside of English because he went and spent a year in Japan when he was in high school and I remember one night over dinner he he just explained to me how he learned the language cuz you know if someone says to me look I went to live in France for a year and I learned French I'm like okay well I get that like that strikes me as achievable writer you know I got to spend a year in

[03:28:37] Mexico and I learned Spanish okay I get that I can relate to that but you know you take a white kid out of Long Island and send him to Japan for a year and he comes back speaking obviously with an accent but very fluent Japanese and I think that's incredible and he you know he can really articulate that process so

[03:28:55] I don't know we might have to we would have to make that happen yeah sure make your dad pretty happy right it would make him very happy my dad still counts in his head in Japanese so as much as he wants to be full-on American as he is American but you know he still can't shake that and I know they're waiting for us inside so I guess we should continue this discussion off the mic but I want to thank you so much for everything for coming down and also just for being so generous with your with your insights as well I know we've

[03:29:23] I'm guessing that a lot of what we talked about today you've talked about a thousand times before and it's sort of like God do I have to tell that story all over again but but I think we've also talked about a bunch of things that certainly I've never heard before and maybe that means that for others there's also more of a collection of stuff here last question I have for you though is thinking about your racing career you you talked a lot at the outset about your father instilling this belief in you that there should always be this pursuit of perfection even if you never get there is there a race when you look back at your career that was the narrowest gap between what you perceived to be the perfect race and your actual outcome not necessarily the the place you stood on the podium but just in terms of your execution yeah there's one race that I publicly talk about as being the quasi perfect race and it was the 500 meters in Torino Italy I was not favored to win that race I hadn't won that race all year long I hadn't won a gold yet and those Olympics it was clear that the

[03:30:19] South Korean team was just better at those games and I was in the final and I had incredible athletes to skate against and I knew my only option was to basically we call it jamming the pack where you slow down so that people can't get their momentum to pass you right so if you can imagine driving a Honda on a freeway and a Ferrari is behind you imagine the Honda wherever the Ferrari goes the Honda is in that Lane so it doesn't matter how fast the Ferrari is he can't pass because he's blocked by that car that was the strategy that I used in that race I wasn't the fastest I wasn't the best I wasn't the most likely to win and I was able to pull off a wire-to-wire win so that was publicly that was one of the races that I think that was the most perfect for me because everything was on the line I wanted to win everyone had kind of given up on my team they thought that I wasn't gonna win that race my sport psychologist at the time basically said Apollo this is yourself second on the big game it's amazing what you've gone through crazy that you came back and you won another couple of medals you should be really proud of yourself and I took that as like are you giving up on me man like what there's only one more race left and so it was personally very very powerful in this role and I've had a couple of other races where just execution-wise it was so perfect just the pass being in that flow state everything felt very automatic and easy it slowed down the minute and a half long race felt like five minutes I feel like I produce zero lactic acid in my body and it felt like I just was simply significantly faster than everybody else

[03:31:50] I feel like neo from the matrix and I don't say that with any exaggeration it just felt so incredibly easy to maneuver and dance on my skates and pass that I was like the puppet master and those are the feelings that I think we all of us are addicted whether you're a writer whether you're a doctor whether you are a singer you have that one glimpse of being in a true state of flow and it's so difficult to replicate and you've spent years years searching for that one time and you do everything possible you go back any track what did I eat that day well I had three grapes in the morning well you know what's gonna happen the next two years the three grapes and they're all green for the rest of my life right you just try to replicate because you don't know what changed and I'm not sure we can we can really identify what that is but those moments are the ones that I crave and I get into those moments no longer in sports sometimes I get it too when I'm in the gym when I'm alone that's my sanctuary but in conversation like our conversation three and a half hours went by earlier and I had no idea because I was so transported into that moment and to me that feels perfect because you're present you're here the quality of time is being spent and you know hopefully people at home didn't fall asleep listening to my crazy speed skating exercise I'm sure they didn't I'm gonna get you into race car driving because that is another example of where this flow thing happens so your lap time on the track is like you'll you'll focus on I mean in many ways to me driving a race cars are basically just a bunch of time trials mm-hmm and I know it sounds like a cliche but my absolute fastest laps in any car on any lap never feel that fast yes that is the most amazing feeling usually when I set a lap record which is just meaning my lap record like I'm never gonna be the guy that sets the actual lap record but my lap records are always after the fact I just notice it

[03:33:49] I'm like wait holy you took like five tenths off your fastest time ever and that felt effortless that that really is a beautiful feeling isn't it it's an amazing and it you're right it is so addictive and I think that's part of why competitive sports have been displaced by you know things that I do not necessarily competitively but just gonna bet over myself like you know archery and racecar driving and these things because you're waiting for that day when it's like oh my god you did 12 out of 12 shots Oh bullseye how did that happen that's what people run some people do Ironman and some people do triathlons it's why people do everything and I'm convinced that you have to care enough about the outcome for you to get in that state there has to be some form of consequence maybe that physical maybe that danger but psychologically to impact you to almost force yourself into that realm that's why I think athletes always time and time getting in that flow state more than anyone else as with the military and people in the service because they're in real true flow state because you know they will die if they're not but I think that there's a lot to be said there and I think that we as human beings take that for granted I think athletes a lot of times take that for granted and trying to achieve that flow state of maintaining that mental consistency and that's what I was seeking for all those years it's why I read all those books about sports psychology and the brain and behavior and understand myself and others and it's a beautiful thing yeah so where can people find you in social media social

[03:35:14] I'm at Apollo oh no on Twitter my Instagram is you know there for pictures but I'm not as active as I'd like to be and it's something that I would like to restart and what's your handle on instagrams are the same it's the same at Apollo know any books that you recommend that you've I know you've written a couple any of those that you think people ought to follow up on based on what we've talked about today where you have one called no regrets which basically describes kind of this this ethos going into the 2010 games yeah I mean my book of it was called zero regrets I wrote that right after limping games I had an amazing experience but it's kind of like a snippet into my life and also we got to remember I was in that mind frame of really just post olympic games without all these other experiences involved be able to really think back objectively and think and remember and really understand what was happening at a time but that was you know one of the books that I had written with a ghostwriter when I say I had written I didn't actually write the book I wish I was a great writer and had that talent my writing skills are subpar but I really enjoyed reading and I really enjoy learning and so I've I mean look I've invested I've spent time in to businesses and deals and things that would are so far away from sports that would really blow those mines and because I just fascinated right I'm curious learner and it's been amazing opening the next chapter of the life and where life takes me well it's amazing to know that you know your athletic career spanned what twelve years basically your professional career your career is a father whatever else you want to do is gonna span multiples of that so in many ways the best is yet to come right I believe so I hope that's true for all of us I think so all right man thanks again it's been awesome thank you thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter DMV com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
