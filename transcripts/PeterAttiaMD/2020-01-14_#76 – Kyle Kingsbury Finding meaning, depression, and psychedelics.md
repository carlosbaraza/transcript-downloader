In this episode, Kyle Kingsbury, retired UFC fighter and director of human optimization at Onnit, discusses the purpose and meaning that football and MMA gave him but which also acted as a distraction from his inner demons. Kyle opens up about his use of PEDs (steroids, testosterone, HGH) in college and talks about some of the misconceptions around them. Next, Kyle talks about his battle with depression and a close call with suicide that lead to life-changing experiences with psilocybin and ayahuasca—which really became the turning point in his own journey towards being more emotionally healthy, finding inner peace, and being a better husband and father.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because

[00:02:04] I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:17] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is Kyle Kingsbury some of you may recognize Kyle he's a retired UFC fighter he's been on the joggin experience a number of times he's currently the director of human optimization at on it I first met Kyle in person during a hunting trip in early 2019 though we had both known sort of about each other prior to that and seen each other in interviews and things like that so we immediately clicked and become very close since time now in this episode which truthfully you know when you're interviewing people that you know pretty well you don't really know where you're going to go and honestly this episode in this interview went in places I did not expect it to go in and for which I'm incredibly grateful we could have spent a lot of this time talking about UFC and mixed martial arts and all of those things and and that would have been interesting but we went to places that

[00:04:48] Kyle has never talked about publicly in fact a couple of things that he hadn't even shared with me privately before so I was incredibly moved by this experience so you know we talked about his upbringing playing football going to JC then college we talked about his experience with performance-enhancing drugs something I don't think he's ever really spoken about before as a little sidebar we talked about something called the Wiz inator which is about the funniest thing I've ever heard of talk about his transition away from football after realizing he wasn't gonna make it to the NFL and it's during this piece that Kyle really opens up about this period of depression in his life and his thoughts of suicide that have been somewhat recurrent and had started as early as you know the age of 7 he talks about his close calls with suicide his eventual transition into MMA and UFC and we end our talk with a conversation around his experience with ayahuasca towards the end of his UFC career and how that really became the turning point in his own journey towards being sort of more emotionally healthy and frankly what's enabled him to become a father and become the father that he wishes you know he could have had now before we get into this conversation I feel it's really important to have a couple of disclaimers first in his conversation

[00:05:55] Kyle really opens up about his past depression and his thoughts of suicide and how close he was to it on a number of occasions there's a very heavy conversation and if you're currently experiencing any thoughts of self-harm or suicide it is imperative that you seek out medical help immediately second Kyle and I have a very open and honest conversation about psychedelics the substances we speak about are illegal and by no means are we advocating for anyone to use them or experiment with them there are physical physiological psychological and legal risks around the use of these plants this conversation is purely informational only Kyle speaks about his personal experiences and how it has shaped his thinking so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with my and kyle Kingsbury my brother how are you I'm doing great brother happy

[00:06:44] Father's Day happy Father's Day to you thank you I forgot it was Father's Day when I woke up and my wife left me this beautiful little note in the counter she had gone out running before I got up and it was like here's your coffee as I was like the sweetest thing what did you do for Father's Day today cuz you're not with your boy no we head back tomorrow to the bay and we'll get like a Father's Day celebration there my dad's gonna come up from Santa Cruz so today is just living the dream I mean I'm on your podcast so

[00:07:10] I'm staying at your house we're gonna shoot arrows after this with a couple of great guys so couldn't ask for much more so did you grew up in Santa Cruz or San Jose right outside San Jose and Cupertino in Sunnyvale got it and you played a ton of sports growing up I imagine was football your big one yeah I wasn't really good I mean I got into baseball late 12 a lot of kids have been playing for a long time so I just played one year football I got into at ten and

[00:07:34] I just loved it immediately like I was playing at that point you had weight classes and age classes so for my weight and age it was I think I don't know right around 105 to 110 pounds when I was 10 I was skinny like a beanpole I mean then that strikes me is big for a ten-year-old but maybe I'm just comparing you to my daughter I don't know I have a good comparison maybe it was less but at 12 we were on the

[00:08:00] Sunnyvale micro rockets that was 118 as I remember that was the last year I could play we had a running back that weighed the same weight we both had to cut weight and he was a great deal shorter than me so he was just stacked I didn't fill out till much later like sophomore year of high school that's interesting kids at 12 cutting weight yeah that's great we'd get the seeds or something like that that are salted and just suck and spit for confirm hours you know on the drive out to games that kind of stuff so in high school you played football football and wrestling in junior high in high school got it so how'd you decide where you want to go for college you know I had for a long time wanting to play in the pac-10 it used to be the pac-10 I think every kid wants to get out of state when they got a lot of them want to get out of state when they go to university as you call it and you don't want to go too far obviously your parents will throw a fit my parents would have but a lot of my good friends that I grew up with that knew since I was 12 years old they were like dude we're going to ASU it's amazing and I had to go to junior college because I was garbage garbage academically I didn't resonate a lot with the teachers

[00:09:06] I had you know we talked about this on my podcast yesterday literally I can count on one hand everyone that stuck out and took me under their wing and saw something in me then more than I saw myself so going to junior college I went for one year and then I realized I can if I transfer to a different junior college that's right by ASU and my likelihood of getting in is much higher so that's what I did so why do you think that is by the way that high school didn't resonate we had a pretty high academic school for a public school a

[00:09:35] Wall Street Journal published us as one of the top ten public schools in the world and we had a lot of people from China and Asia and India coming over it's even higher now it's about I want to say 70 to 80 percent Asian including Indian and the population is what roughly over the high school it was huge

[00:09:52] I mean I think we had 2,500 people in our graduating class senior year 25 what would you mean there were 10,000 kids in that entire high school I don't think so maybe that's the wrong number 2,500 total probably okay yeah couldn't have in 10,000 that's still they couldn't build whatever the portables they couldn't get enough portables one year so we had breached the number that was allowed in the school district and the superintendent gave it an OK because his son went to school with us and a high school that big you don't actually know everybody in your class no there's there's I mean many many kids that I didn't know from that but we kind of I mean like any high school you stick to your core group that kind of thing and I was fortunate enough to have those guys all the way through college and after

[00:10:32] I'm still close with a lot of them I mean obviously knowing you today you're intellectually curious and you know thoughtful stuffs but yeah I always find it interesting when you see people who have kind of gone through a transformation of not resonating with any that stuff until doing so but I often wonder like was there precipitating event was there a bad experience you had with a teacher or something like that you know I wasn't nice in high school or prior to that I got in trouble from kindergarten on it gets into the principal's office at least three days a week I've gotten a lot of fights growing up

[00:11:03] I mean more than the fighting just mess with the teachers you know as a class clown and pretty disruptive and I enjoyed that it gave me some sense of control in my environment I was enjoyed entertaining people and making people laugh so like that checks off every box if I can start riffing and clowning on people and everyone's laughing and looking at me then I can get a little attention and maybe be a you know a little bit of a jerk to the teacher but it was worth it to me so it was actually at ASU I was taking some psychology courses and sociology and communication where I was like oh this [ __ ] matters like I will it doesn't matter if I get a philosophy degree or communications degree like this is think these are things that I will use the rest of my life and that was the first time where it really felt that way a lot of kids complain like what a minute II was algebra for what I'm gonna use this for you know and I think that having that in college really made me think like oh there's a lot to learn and it's there's really cool stuff to learn and that resonates with me and in all those classes I did really well it was all

[00:12:02] Asian I mean Hazen bees as well for me so so it's interesting because if it weren't for football I mean that you jump through a lot of Hoops to get to ASU you're going to jc's before you get there right and a walk-on at issue okay so it begs the question right if you weren't athletic if you were the exact same guy but you didn't happen to have a ability to play you know division 1 football what would you have done after high school something blue collar for sure my dad worked he had a Silicon

[00:12:29] Valley shelving was a company he created in the bay right as the tech boom started and all these tech companies needed static control shelving so he was making a lot of money and he would pay me and my sister to build a lot of this stuff and it was fun for me I was like giant erector sets you know we we'd play with a life-size Lego yeah huge stuff and even you know like we'd get into a warehouse and tee and I would be drilling into concrete and pounding you know giant hammers down and get this stuff anchored and and that was always cool and it paid really well but I enjoyed it so I liked working with my hands there and he came from a different era you know as every dad is but um he always worked on cars and he knew a lot about things and then he would kind of shun me from living the same life as him it was like no you're gonna go into sales you're gonna make a ton of money you'll just pay a guy to work on your car you just pay a guy to fix your house cuz he did all that he did constructions since he was 20 and I was just laughed at it was like these are like really useable skills it's nice to know to change the oil in your car you know I heard you teach me this stuff so thankfully now he's kind of that have had a little bit of success he's happy to show me those things why do you think he felt that way where do I grow up T grew up in the same area he grew up in all my family's from Oregon in the

[00:13:39] Pacific Northwest and then they moved to California my parents met in Alaska and then moved to California I think in large part to be by the Sun and to get away from their families and you know I grew up there and I just think all parents want better for their kids you know in that regard and he saw that as better you know financial success stability those kind of things as better and were they upset then in high school when you weren't doing well academically kind of I mean they paid attention and I get in trouble a lot at home I think for them it was really hard to kind of wrap their brain around how you can wrangle someone in at that point because you know they fought a lot growing up I talked about this before but one of the books that I really have a lot of love for is nonviolent communication by a Marshall

[00:14:29] Rosenberg who recently passed away and whatever that is my childhood was not so they really didn't know how to communicate with one another and it was like two Rams butting heads all the time and then I got divorced when I was 13 and from there that was like the deepest sense of peace I had ever had because it was less stress on both of them they didn't know how to communicate with each other and did you and your sister spend time with both of them or you pretty much my mom got full custody but we'd see my dad every week you know twice a week something like that he was still a big part of our lives and he lived right down the street so and I wanted to see him more because he was a gentler kinder dad at that point it was one of your parents more strict than the other when it came to trying to keep you in line in school I'd say I went back and forth you know and who took the cake there you know they had different different ways of discipline but yeah it was I don't know I think they were at a loss really but they still they never said you're not gonna go to college like the entire time it was you're still going to college I don't give a [ __ ] if you have to go to junior college for three years you're gonna go to college so they were pretty pumped when I got an A as you which is funny there was a Simpsons episode where there's the Great Flood and Ned Flanders like you thank you Lord you've spared the righteous and Damned the wicked and he sees Homer floating in a raft and he's like looks like heavens easier to get into the nares on the state we played that clip all through college like it was it was great it was a feather in our cap but yeah it is it is an easy school to get into yeah but I mean it's it's a school it also has a great reputation as well you get in there and and what a s who's got to be huge it was massive it was still I mean still to this day and even at that point when I was there one of the most highly populated schools in the country huge campus gorgeous campus hot year around for the most part and you know the draw for a young male is that a lot of the ladies there they can't wear much they can't hide it you know because of the heat and that was that was definitely there was some good times there for sure so you walked on mm-hmm and what position do you play

[00:16:31] I was defensive end and defensive tackle it was probably not probably I was for sure undersized to play D tackle but too slow to play at the end so it's kind of an in-betweener and thankfully you were talking about these great teachers that you've had one of them was my strength to conditioning coach actually both strength and conditioning coaches I had a arizona state went on to become strength and conditioning coaches in the

[00:16:52] NFL in the head of the strength and conditioning department it's guy named Joe Ken big house power as uh kind of his moniker now or was then to a big house he's the only guy in division one football history and the NFL to win strength coach of the year in both division one football in the NFL and he's the coach he's the strength coach for the Carolina Panthers mark ooyama he was he went on to become the head strength coach with the 49ers I think he's now with the Vikings I mean both those guys really pushed me past whatever limit I thought I had you know like if there's a ceiling they would push me so far past that I just began to realize like there is no ceiling and you were how old when you showed up you're two years older than yeah I was 20 yeah it was definitely an impressionable time and I was still working through a lot not really knowing how you know drinking a lot doing the party thing we were number one party school in the nation if that's any claim to fame I know one of my friends at med school went to ASU and the stories he told were

[00:17:52] I mean I couldn't I could I couldn't fathom what he was talking about I mean I was really he was speaking another language what did you guys actually do it was my well I mean I can give one example they filmed a porno at one of the fraternities that my friends all went to a theater CAI and they actually shut down all fraternities like they don't exist there anymore because of that so there there was no extreme you couldn't think of that that didn't happen there I mean it was really it was wild and fun and I've lost some friends to drug overdoses and many you know it was polarized for sure you know and there was still people that went there that were you know on the grind and they had all their ducks in a row but I think there was a lot more people just exploring what it felt like to be an adult for the first time did you sort of think about this at the time like I'm escaping from something I'm running from something or did you feel like you were running to something I didn't feel you know it's funny because in those moments of play and pushing the envelope it just felt like we're gonna tear it up tonight you know and it was more of a celebration like I never was an angry drunk I never never saw myself as leaning heavily on a crutch I mean for a whole year in junior college I would wake up and smoke pot every day I'd have to wake up my roommate to light the four foot bong for me because I couldn't reach it with my hand that's how I'd start the day and I had all my classes on Tuesday Thursday schedule so five days off a week and even in that whole year I never thought like I'm overdoing it it was just the thing to do and now obviously that's not much different but and we'll get into plant medicines but I think that was really where it lifted the veil and showed me how much I was destroying myself without realizing it when you decide I want to go to ASU to play football was that a means to an end where did you think that was was there some thought you had him back your mind

[00:19:38] I might make it to the NFL yeah I always wanted to play in the NFL that was the light at the end of the tunnel and I think there was a lot of things driving me for that one my love of the game like it was it was my greatest joy it was my first legal outlet to let off the steam and because of the positions I played

[00:19:55] I really got to you know his button heads every single play of every moment I was on the field once I got to ASU I didn't play much I really was a benchwarmer and at ASU I had to embrace my role as a secondary guy for the first time in my life everyone who makes it to college was an all-star in high school you know and the jump is even higher to the NFL and I remember seeing a guy who graduated a year before me who had played he started every game all four years in defensive line which is you're a wide receiver that's fine but defensive line that's pretty tough to do that to start every game your entire and he didn't make it to the NFL and that was like oh [ __ ] all right maybe I should think about something else because even if I get playing time my senior year it's pretty unlikely that that's gonna happen and there was a lot of guys going into Arena

[00:20:40] League and Canada football and things like that it was like mmm I don't know there was a piece of me that that wanted to be the best or at least play with the best and if I wasn't gonna do that there was no point and I think that there was a decision because I could have gotten a scholarship to play at like a D to school or d1 double-a and I said no I'd rather walk on and play with the big boys so kind of having that mindset going in I knew I wasn't gonna play some subpar level of football even though I probably could have extended my career there it's amazing I think for a lot of people that maybe aren't as familiar with that what those jumps look like between High School Division one and the

[00:21:16] NFL I think I was having this one with my daughter a while ago it must have been during the college football season and I don't remember how it came up at the point I wanted to make to her was if you take the very very very best team in college football the team that's gonna win the national championship and you put them against the very very worst team in the NFL it would be the biggest blowout in the history of football I mean it in as many possessions as you could have that's how many times the NFL team would score and she just like couldn't understand like how that could happen and I didn't have a great explanation for I said I think one it's just a much tighter selection process and at the end of the day once you reach the NFL you're a professional and nothing else matters like this is your job but it is interesting and it must be sobering to to get there and sort of realize oh my god like even if you're exceptional in college it doesn't guarantee you get to this neck level yeah it doesn't guarantee that your practice squad and that's where I was like damn and I had a lot of guys from our team did go pro some of them played for a few years on practice squad other guys actually had like decent careers playing starting in the NFL and couple started for the Dolphins and different teams and it was cool to watch that but it was like it didn't seem like there was rhyme or reason to me cuz a lot of these guys in college you know they were good and they made progressions but they just kept getting better that was the difference like they were late bloomers whatever you want to call it but they kept improving kept getting faster kept learning the routes better or whatever the position was and

[00:22:44] I think a big part of it is they also were the guys that don't get injured as much I think injury avoidance is such an underappreciated piece of professional sports I don't know the exact numbers but you know the median duration of an NFL player is staggeringly short it's like three to five years and so we can sort of celebrate these people that spend 10 15 years in the NFL but there's such outliers you know the name of the game first and foremost once you're there is just figure out a way to not get hurt and you talked to Joe Ken or anybody that's a strength coach that's all they're focused on and it's it's really even in the offseason they might have talked periods of time where they're working on guys getting a little faster or guys getting little stronger a little more weight that kind of thing but come season it's just preservation that's it had you done any performance-enhancing drugs in high school no I mean I played actually my senior year started with testosterone had a guy with Justin on 250 and I realized I wanted to play college football so that was the that was the place like alright I got to put on some sighs I've weighed about 220 prior to or after prior to and then to 13-year 164 60s 16 and a half so like that was the time where I think for me it was about if I'm gonna do this let's do this and being thin you know it was like alright

[00:23:59] I got put on some size unless I'm going to change positions entirely but I enjoyed the positions I played so let's let's pack on the pounds and I was pretty disappointed only gave me 10 pounds but there was that was a catalyst to what sleep knows you know and I had my dad telling me like you got a sleep better you gotta get to bed on time you can't stay out all night those kind of things and and you got to eat well you got to eat more and at that point it was just a number game you know it didn't mean eating the food that I eat now is just me eating more you know getting more protein and more calories in general so I think once

[00:24:30] I started to pay attention to that stuff that's where I was starting to gain the size and then throughout junior college was testosterone still kind of the staple of supplementation yeah no doubt and I gained fairly consistently still kind of undersized so I think by the end of my junior college I was about 250 you know and put that in perspective I mean that's big for a lot of people but there's linebackers that are 250 pounds plenty of middle linebackers that are that size so for the position still small yeah and then what's it like when you get to a place like ASU not again

[00:25:05] I'm not singling out ASU I think this is probably true it has to be true of every Division one school right yeah and I don't want to come across this floyd landis so I'm not gonna paint a picture what other people are doing no no yourself like what it was it was good because I you know I was introduced to a doctor a naturopath and he for better and for worse and we'll talk about what that worst looks like he would give me anything that I wanted thankfully we were doing routine blood work to look at something my father who

[00:25:31] I included on this we were pretty adamant about so that's when I first experimented was growth hormone igf-1 different things I think when I when I realized I wasn't gonna go pro that was the when I started taking deca durable and with testosterone and that was great for inflammation and just feeling better at that point it really was like how big can I get and I still had a ceiling you know my senior year I was 268 I couldn't gain a pound more and I was having just and just give me a sense of dose how much you were you were mixing decadron and sipping 850 50 or like wonder one ratio of those no it was probably 600 milligrams of tested pn8 and 400 milligrams of decadron when you would take a week about a gram total yeah which is just amazing I want to put this in perspective for listeners I have a subset of patients who are getting testosterone replacement therapy for you know hypogonadism right so middle-aged guy who's you know you can't get his testosterone back into a normal range with all the usual stuff beginning by the way with sleep is sort of rule number one you don't run a place testosterone until a person sleeping reasonably well but to put this in perspective I would say a normal starting dose of testosterone

[00:26:40] Sippy innate is somewhere in the vicinity of 80 to 100 milligrams a week and we like to divide that twice a week because the half-life of sip units about three days so you'll get a smoother dose a couple of patients will even do it daily you know they'll put in with sipping a Mississippian a yeah subcu injection and they'll do 10 to 13 10 to 14 milligrams a day would be sort of a daily dose and then that's you know pert and you know it's really interesting by the way with that you see no FSH LH suppression the natural range is about 11 milligrams a day give or take for men so that's like where you're you're kind of mimicking that yeah that's the part that blows my mind is we just discovered this by accident when a patient just on his own decided to start date like he felt started out doing it injecting once a week and then twice a week and you're cutting the dose down of course each time and then he decided well Daly must give you the most perfectly smooth way to do it and I said well yeah if you don't mind giving yourself a little shot every day but it's actually a pretty the sub-q with the tiny needle is not a big deal so when we looked at his blood it was really amazing he was like the only place I never seen a testosterone subpoenaed to a normal FSH and LH he'd looked like he was not taking exogenously esta Sturm and then we tried this with a couple other patients in sure enough that's the case I think the highest amount of testosterone I've ever prescribed to a patient is probably in the neighborhood of a hundred and forty to 160 milligrams in a week and if you're talking did you say six hundred of Siffin eight four hundred Decker vice versa there one go wondering Evelyn so it's a thousand a week right which is

[00:28:14] I've seen that a lot in athletes and bodybuilders and stuff like that what kind of side effects do you have from a dose that high well that's where I capped it you know and there's bodybuilders that will go over in the 3 to 5 gram a week range and what I know Loosli they likely have more receptor sites and they're gonna deal with the side effects no matter what's coming up for him

[00:28:32] I get acne in season but I think it was from the shoulder pads I never washed those kind of things so yeah I'd get acne and stuff like that on the back I don't know how much that affected my mind because it felt good and with the amount of training that I was doing it was a positive did you understand what testosterone at the time I know today you have a much better understanding of course but at the time did you understand what this molecule is doing to transcription factors in your you know cells and how it's helping you recover better like or was it were you not I mean that's maybe a dumb question what what kid in college is thinking of that but did you just think like taking this makes me bigger and stronger did you have a sense of why well I understood increased protein synthesis things like that I think there was a book called anabolics 2000 by dr.

[00:29:15] William Llewellyn which is where I started to take a deep dive and it you know that's the funny that's so Llewellyn's principles of pharmacology is one of my favorite books on the entire study of anabolics I have like it's like you know the volume yeah it's a good Bible to Bible and it's it's long and wide it's not just thick like it's it's a really it's a great place if anybody's looking to do this definitely mind it highly enough because one of the things I love about Llewellyn is totally unemotional there's no editorializing right it's not like these things are horrible these things are wonderful it's like okay let's go through every single one of these molecules painfully deep and we'll just talk about the relative differences similarities between them what they do what they don't do and yeah

[00:29:58] I'm a big I'd love to meet Llewellyn I don't know if he must be still alive he's got a young he's got to be he was doing I think and then the last one I read was I think he had 2007 was the last one that I know I had a more recent one than that and he and I've seen pictures of him and he looks like he's young buddy of mine had like 2011 so like he's for sure still around if he's writing books he's not on his deathbed you know how hard it is read a book yeah so you're reading Llewellyn which is actually kind of interesting I'm guessing and not everybody who's taken testosterone is reading Llewellyn's principles of pharmacology to understand what's going on one thing I just curious about you mentioned you were never the nasty drunk right you were so one of the things that people talk about is well if you take that much anabolic steroid you it must change your mood did you experience that I didn't feel that's what I was alluding to with that positive well-being I couldn't wrap my head around roid rage for the life of me

[00:30:51] I thought and then to that note I began to see like whether the guy was on like five friends that had that particular outcome from bollocks they were that way without it they hadn't unpacked their [ __ ] to begin with and that's why whatever amplifiers in them is gonna draw that out same thing goes with alcohol or anything else you know you you give somebody a little fuel to the fire and I think was Wayne

[00:31:15] Dyer asset and if you squeeze an orange what are you get orange juice if somebody squeezes you what do you get well whatever's gonna come out of you right and that's that's the difference not that I was all rainbows and [ __ ] clouds in the inside I still had a lot of work to do which wouldn't come four years later that's interesting to see at that dose because I mean I don't have experience clinically with those doses

[00:31:35] I've I've seen it anecdotally like in cases like yours but I've I've never had the ability to clinically observe what happens at what we call Supra physiologic doses but at physiologic doses which I have lots of experience with patients I've never once seen any of these horror show side effects that people talk about and I have come to the same conclusion which is steroids are a lot like money you know people talk about well that guy's a rich [ __ ] and it's like I don't think those are necessarily the same thing he's an [ __ ] who then got a lot of money and that just allowed him to amplify his

[00:32:10] Idaho as [ __ ] admissible thing this and similarly like I think if you take a really aggressive angry person and you give them more anabolic steroids you can probably amplify that phenotype but don't you don't create that phenotype that's why I've seen some of the most beautiful people in the world I've seen or some of the wealthiest people as well because they were just happen to be good people and give them a bunch of money now they can amplify they're good through that so yeah I think I think of those the same and it but but what's interesting is that at such high doses my observation at least anecdotally and you is still the same which is didn't it actually seemed to be quite positive ah this is a topic I'm super interested in because I think that the science on this whole topic is so misunderstood I think that the fear-mongering around these drugs and by the way to be really clear I have no idea if the doses you were taking are safe my my intuition is it's probably not a good idea to be clear so anybody listening those who thinks that me having this discussion is somehow endorsing taking a thousand milligrams a week of testosterone testosterone equivalent it's a good idea I don't think it is but that's mainly because I don't have data

[00:33:20] I don't have long-term data I've seen short-term data right I've seen studies of eight twelve sixteen weeks where you put athletes on those kinds of doses which is effectively ten times the normal amount of testosterone these studies don't find bad outcomes of course you are probably taking it for longer than 16 weeks and that's my whole point which is I don't know how to extrapolate outside of the normal window but when you start to talk about normal physiologic doses and all the fear-mongering that comes with that stuff I don't know what it is about our society we really love to misunderstand things there was a very famous story that was talked about in that documentary that Mark Bell may never say that Chris Bell made you know story about that bigger stronger faster yeah I forget the boy's name he depressed when he jumped off because he didn't have post psychotherapy yeah I would even put a different spin on that which is and again this is I don't mean to sound unethical all because I know that in the documentary they feature very prominently his father who's adamant that steroids killed his son and if I were in his shoes I think I'd probably say the same thing but this gets to the point of I would argue that people who are gonna take steroids for non-medical use are probably searching for something anyway there's a void that's probably trying to be filled there and in the case of this boy who I forget his name because of the tea I think it was like

[00:34:40] Tyler or Taylor or something like that you know high school kid I think he was a baseball player if I recall you take ten kids who play high school baseball there's a subset of them that are gonna gravitate towards wanting this maybe it's because they want to be better maybe they want to be better because they're sort of filling some other void it's probably that that at least increases their susceptibility to depression and not that not that the testosterone is causing the depression that that's sort of my view and then I think that's a bit too nuanced to explain but it feeds into this discussion of which one's driving the other and that's why when you look at studies of this stuff where you get the luxury of not having to rely on a person self-selecting into it and instead you can use the process of randomization I just think these findings just they never show up the medical literature of testosterone use now you mentioned growth hormone as well why growth hormone what did it offer above testosterone I think from a recovery standpoint and I don't know how much of that was a SIBO effect and I was taking probably four IU's a day which is not that much actually in the big picture is it no but I could feel the side effects you know like little tingly fingers in the middle of night some level of carpal tunnel and that's also for sure had to do with the water weight

[00:35:52] I was carrying and you know just being a swole for for lack of a better word did you ever take growth hormone without testosterone no so we don't know what growth hormone alone would have felt like yeah but I do remember I mean playing defensive line you get bumps and bruises every day and I rolled my ankle really hard and the next day it was like nothing had ever happened and I was astonished I thought I was gonna wake up and have blue and purple around my foot for a month it was a bad bad sprain and literally the next day like there was no swelling it felt great I went right back to practice and I could do everything again so I was like okay this is worth $1,000 a month like it just made perfect sense to me at that point how did you come up with the money for all this was the growth hormone alone a thousand dollars a month it certainly was so without let's just say that part was sponsored let's leave it at that and the testosterone while nowhere near as expensive at the doses you're taken can't be it still gotta be a couple hundred bucks a month right yes but she goes it's through a doctor and obviously insurance isn't covering any of that now did you guys get drug tested in college we did and I don't know if you remember this but there was a thing what I think was I don't want to get the guy's name wrong maybe we can look it up Ryan can you look up if it was Onterrio Smith they got caught with the Wiz inator so who is a native - a turd the old Wiz inator you know it was so great I remember going into the weed shop back then of course they didn't have cannabis there they just had Boggs and whatever and I saw this thing and they had like seven different colors of a penis like what the hell is this doing here and they're like oh man this for your piss test and I was like are you serious okay all right we got confirmation it was

[00:37:30] Onterrio Smith you [ __ ] it up for everyone but you know I've seen all the different colors and I'm like huh so how does it work you get somebody's clean urine is no you don't even have to do that it comes with synthetic urine and they're Japanese heat pad that sticks to the outside and then you have the other the the other part of it pressed against your pubic hair or whatever and then when you're asked to pull it out you just pull out that one and it's kind of like you remember the toy water weenie back in the 80s it's got a little clique in it's like surgical tubing you'd fill with water and then squirt people so anyways you unclick this thing and just free flows and you can push on it a little bit to get it out but it's always at like one-and-a-half X whatever the 100 milliliter standard is does the drug test or not actually look at you avoiding I mean I had a guy look at my penis and he saw the wizard a derp but I had my pants on he didn't make me drop trou you know whereas what does he do when he sees a purple penis well I have a funny story about that so my penis the the my fake penis didn't didn't look far our discussion taken out of context is out of control we will have him clip this for social my fake penis looked very similar to my actual penis in terms of color loaning that out to one of my teammates oh who was that black didn't go so well for him thankfully he said it as long as the test is clean when he got caught I won't [ __ ] in trouble and of course he got off because he had clean piss the issue what we saw with the widow nadir in pro sports is that the synthetic urine contained no levels of hormone so you'd show zero on to sex hormones across the board so then they know something was up that would qualify as a positive test I was kind of rolling the dice with n-c-double-a I figured at that point I wasn't gonna get you know what are they gonna do bust the guy who's [ __ ] third string barely made travel squad so yeah I was rolling the dice there they make you go to your ankles with your pants or whatever you wearing the team guys that just glanced down see what you got as long as it's a penis and you're not pulling something out of a cup you're okay in other words there was sort of the was this the n-c-double-a that was basically turning a blind eye to this then the team guys and then the n-c-double-a they would have you pull your pants down but they're you know I don't from what I understand not super weird about it because it wasn't invasive like I hear horror stories from from the guys that are fighting now and had saudade knocking on the door at 3:00 a.m. yeah the whiz inators not gonna work when you sada or water comes right now not even close never would have I'm amazed I mean I've never really thought about this problem specifically but I'm amazed people haven't come up with artificial bladders and things that are more nuanced well I think it was what was that movie with the old football movie I think was in the 90s with

[00:40:13] Latimer is just jacked to the gills yeah he did the oil change where yeah well urine out of his bladder and then have someone else's injected in with it yes yes I'd be blanking on what that was that wasn't any given Sunday was it No the program yeah yeah James Caan yeah yeah I don't know how often that was going down I don't think people were going to that those kind of extremes in college maybe a higher levels of sport but his growth hormone detectable on any other tests it certainly wasn't even something that we're testing for in college I had know a couple of people who have had that come up for them in fighting now with you sada to what degree that's accurate

[00:40:52] I'm not sure so you know a lot of these guys have loitered up and and are fighting it whether or not they were successful or not I have no idea so College comes to an end you sort of realize you're not gonna make it to the NFL what do you think about as a next chapter I was just you know model The Wiz inator that's always got to be on the table as an option work opportunity that's all right that was my next venture you know I quit going after my senior football and I was really starting to battle my own personal demons at that point that same doctor so

[00:41:23] I talked about the better and worse of having a doctor that would give me anything he was prescribing me 2 milligrams an X calms any bars because they had the four squares 60 at a time 10 milligram valium 60 at a time with five refills on both 10 milligram it was even legal meaning I didn't know it's not legal he went to jail later okay he gone one of my friends died so that guy

[00:41:47] I'm sure he's out now but needless to say also 10 milligrams of vicodin 60 at a time 5 refills now thankfully for me personally and I've lost a lot of friends to opiates it was very hard for me to take a high dose and feel good I would get nauseated and puke violently so there was always like this you had a built-in yeah built-in governor when it came to opiates but having had a lot of stuff that I hadn't worked on internally and we can dive into that but it just these anti-anxiety medications were [ __ ] perfect like I would feel great there's a euphoria I'd sleep very well if I was using cocaine or ecstasy and these are pressed shitty pills not the type of

[00:42:27] MDMA we talked about with Rick Doblin just a whole different ballgame I'd be up till 5 a.m. then I take my xanax something like that you know and that's you know you're playing that roller coaster so you're already done with football but you're still like finishing college at this point mm-hmm and that's when I quit going to school so I didn't see I had finished 95% of my communications classes in sociology and at that point in order to stay eligible

[00:42:52] I'd switch my degree so many times there was this [ __ ] degree called a bachelor and interdisciplinary studies which is fine select two minors to equal a major and I enjoyed the coursework but once I got to my senior year a lot of the classes became actual bis classes where you would go in and have to write these long-ass papers yet you'd present to a potential employer and why it was actually better that you had a basket-weaving degree and not an actual degree and I couldn't stand it like it was just so fake to me and really like not enjoying a school at that point not having a reason to be there not having a reason to standard you taken loans out to be in school at this point yes oh yeah so you're paying to do this thing that you think is not helpful correct you know I said I'd take a semester off my parents didn't really fuss over it and really got into pills with alcohol and cocaine and ecstasy and that was something that I've been doing but because of football keeping me there was a point in time where I knew I had to straighten up each and every year and really being a fan of the gym and who I was training with that also would kind of regulate me so even in the offseason

[00:43:56] I was still kind of I was mindful of the debauchery and then without that it was mindless debauchery really and I was very depressed I didn't know what I wanted to do from that point on and probably came to one of the most depressing points in my life and to give some background from and I've talked about this on a solo podcast I did a long time ago which for sure I don't think anyone here has heard it but from about seven years old on I had thoughts of suicide and like pretty vivid like thinking of my dad's handguns or his rifles or how I would use a bow and arrow put it plainly I remember having a conversation with my dad on the deck of our condo and I asked him what would happen if I fell off of this and landed face first in the concrete and he said you probably wouldn't die you just be really messed up from that point on and but that was me he didn't realize at the time those me checking to see like kind of kill myself by jumping off this [ __ ] mountain how old are you seven four seven yeah six seven and that would circle back had I mean many times throughout the year that would circle back what do you think was at the root of that it was really hard it was really hard to see my family fight so often you know it was constant and my little sister is just a year younger than me and I could feel her shift I could feel her clothes inside and wall off and you know being the oldest my dad was the oldest he was a little bit harder on me than her and that stuck out it was just really I mean without too many details it was very very difficult and it really felt I think at the root of a lot of depression is this concept that it will never get better there's no light at the end of the tunnel there's no way out of this and that's that's how I felt most of my childhood was just like this is not going to get better I remember when

[00:46:06] I was 10 my mom said I'm thinking about divorcing your father and I said yes do it my sister was in panic she didn't want family to get broken apart but a part of me knew once that happened like they would be better people for it because they weren't meant to be together and it took three more years for that to actually happen but yeah it was it was it was incredibly difficult and I think coming to this place now we're once again I felt like I didn't have any viable option of doing something that was meaningful with my life and not to mention from a neurochemical and with all the buttons you know up down up down lack of sleep you had Matthew Walker on three episodes like I now see that very clearly when I read his book where we sleep I was like well yeah no she had no shadows I was messed up in the head but

[00:47:00] I saw I watched the Sun come up many many nights in the beautiful double-edged sword of an anti-anxiety pill is that you feel [ __ ] great while you're on it and the second you stop taking it all that unworked through stuff is still there it's just waiting to come up once that chemicals out of your body and so I had a fight with my girlfriend at the time and there really was this thought in my head that I'll never be loved

[00:47:27] I will never find love and with that I took every remaining pill that I had and I drove up to the top of parking lot 7 at Arizona State thankfully a security guard saw me pulling up at like 2:00 a.m. got out of the car stripped down naked and walked climbed one more flight of stairs and was standing on the edge about ready to jump and I heard hey what are you doing up there and I looked back actually let me rewind that I had been to church growing up but I didn't consider myself a religious person most of that stuff didn't resonate with me at all particularly with regarding gay people going to hell like I was from the

[00:48:05] Bay Area that [ __ ] really didn't resonate with me and there was a lot of other things that stood out to me as there didn't he didn't make sense yeah hypocritical that kind of stuff and but as I was standing there before the security guard said anything that was my first real spiritual experience like this I don't know if was the chemicals kickin in but this wash of warmth came throughout my body from head to toe and it was the most peace that I had felt ever in my entire life do you think it's because you sensed it might be over yeah it was the time to go for me like there was no no reason to stay and this voice and there might have been a voice in my head I might have been outside of me I don't think that's the point the voice just said not yet it's okay oh yeah so this guy gets you off the ledge literally gets me off the ledge and then

[00:49:01] I wake up in a hospital with all my family there they flew out from California obviously to Arizona I don't really have a recollection of what happened after that other than I remember asking my mom like wire was this male nurse such a dick and she's like you you weren't very nice to him you weren't very nice to anyone here and knowing myself I just kind of laughed and said yeah that's that's for sure what happened so I spent about a week in a detox center they had everything from group therapy to activities they wanted to wean me off the anxiety medication knowing how long

[00:49:37] I'd been on that and didn't like I had mentioned where there was no real problem with the opiates so they didn't mean that but put me on klonopin for the week and the first dose I took I remember walking up to the nurse like I'm I'm [ __ ] high right now I don't want to be high I want that I want to I want to go cold turkey and they're like no it's it's really important that we wean you because you can have potential side effects here and I was like I don't care I'm not gonna take it I'm telling you right now I'm not gonna take it so thankfully they they cut my dose to nothing that was an interesting time because there was a lot of people there that had I mean not to make comparisons but people that didn't have all the same opportunities that I had and didn't look the way that I looked and weren't as young as me or as fit as me or any of the things that I had going on a lot of them didn't have family there supporting them my family would come in every day and they were staying in a hotel they had nothing else to do but but check on after me I think at that stage you know when you have other people saying like what are you doing here you have so much going on it's like you don't [ __ ] know and that's to my point when someone's depressed they see through their lens they don't see through anyone else's lens it's just like this is water right and so you could have everyone on [ __ ] Obama could show up and say like look what you have going on for you and you'd say you don't know what's going on for me and that's really how I felt when

[00:50:58] I got out I had a psychologist and a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist I was pretty adamant that I didn't want to go down the SSRI rabbit hole I had family members that had done that and I saw it was just a merry-go-round of different things and finally when they found something that would work they did inevitably have to increase the dosage so I said no to that I was prescribed lithium and I took it for about a week and I remember thinking like I am a [ __ ] mute my whole life I've been an extrovert I've enjoyed talking to people

[00:51:29] I've walked through public speaking classes in college now I'm a mute there was no high there was no low the diagnosis was bipolar what does to lithium diddly but they must have put you on a very heavy dose saladin I know some you know I think we know some people that benefit very greatly from a low dose of that but at the time it was like I can't do this either and I remember talking to the psychiatrist who actually resonated more with me than the psychologist has I've had great therapists but that guy wasn't it psychiatrist is like all right if you don't want to take anything read these and he handed me six studies on fish oil and the brain and that was my first like okay from like a holistic standpoint of what supplementation can look like rather than just creatine and testosterone maybe there's something to this and started something with fish oil more importantly than that started creating space for myself to actually look at my life and just create like a distance from the party atmosphere like maybe I can take a break and with that started to see a shift started to get goals were you back in class at this point no I never looked that very cool I never went back to school so I'm still a senior at ASU officially you know I had fought a lot growing up like I talked about and I had watched the UFC from its infancy was a huge fan of pride I had no intention of becoming a professional fighter but I knew what I was missing and what I was missing in football was camaraderie it was being able to butt heads it was some physical interaction with another human and then the training

[00:52:58] I would go instead of training with all these guys and having some of the best coaches the world hyping me up before a lift I'm listing by myself at 24 hour fitness I'm on a [ __ ] treadmill like there was no real draweth to do that I felt like a rat on the wheel knowing that something I missed I wanted to start training in mixed martial arts just for the training just for the camaraderie just for the ability to learn something new age each day and not really know like I don't wanna have to design my entire workout in the gym like let me go here and learn something brand new and maybe make some friends in the process in probably three months into that there was a guy at gym owner out in Arizona who ran rage in the cage was a local very low level show and he said dude you're big you're handsome he played football you're athletic fight for me at heavyweight you don't have to do it one time if you don't want to do it again you don't have to and so

[00:53:49] I said all right in my first two fights I won in under 30 seconds I'm not saying I was great or anything like that I what I am saying is there is a difference between an athlete that comes from Division one and a lot of the guys fighting heavyweight at the time and this was in MMA yes mixed martial arts and what are the rules quickly what are the rules what are the parameters I think everybody's heard of MMA people sometimes don't understand the difference between MMA and UFC like there sometimes people use these terms synonymously but let's start with what mixed martial arts means in analogy I like to use is is mixed martial arts is to the UFC as tissues are to Kleenex a lot of people and say can you hand me a tissue let's say pass me a Kleenex whether it's Kleenex brand or not so the

[00:54:30] UFC being the highest level of sport that is mixed martial arts and then you know mixed martial arts can have there's there's anime shows all over the world now at varying levels but mixed martial arts is the practice of bringing all things together typically these four to five ounce gloves that are fingerless you can grab you can't strike in the back of the head there used to be varying rules you know and pride you could stomp a guy's face you could sucker could guy's face wise on the ground you could need a guy's head while he's on all fours no no that's a lot in the UFC or in all of North America to my understanding can you not yeah it's yeah you can't kick to the nuts can't pull hair and a lot of this stuff when when

[00:55:12] MMA started was allowed you know it was no-holds-barred but see where's the mm eh when did it really first start I think it's different you know for different people different camps would say it was Bruce Lee different camps would say they would say dude kundo was the original yeah and Kaji Kenpo also was a different forms of full-contact karate kickboxing jiu-jitsu we just had

[00:55:34] John hakumen on a podcast and he is a Kaji Kenpo background out of Hawaii and now he created Hawaiian Kempo so there's there's merit in both you know but it is that bridging of different forms and the arc of MMA if you haven't seen it started off as like this is what I'm good at versus this is what you're good at it was like the kumite and bloodsport so you'd have a boxer against a sumo wrestler and then you know as it progressed people began to have more than one trick pony a couple skill sets so I'm good at defending takedowns and

[00:56:05] I'm really good at stand-up so I could stand a bang sprawl and brawl we're terms that were being used or I'm a great wrestler and I can pound you when you're on the ground so ground-and-pound became a thing and then as this transition and now you have to know everything in any position because if you have a weakness it's going to be exploited and in parallel to this you've got this bridge Brazilian Jiu Jitsu that is being you know you've got these incredible Gracie's and all these other guys over there doing this other form of traditional Jiu Jitsu and when does that start to merge with MMA because today it's almost impossible to distinguish like it's almost impossible to imagine

[00:56:41] MMA without Brazilian jiu-jitsu right I think right as the UFC came along that was the point on what date and when did the UFC come in 293 so there's a different group of ownership I forget the guys name Bob something but um he started the UFC with in large part with the Gracie's and they according to their story wanted to bring in a guy who wasn't the best wasn't the most fit wasn't the strongest and they they brought in hoist Gracie just a illustrate like this is a technical thing it's not that he's a gifted athlete and he's gonna do this to you he's not our best athlete he's not our best Gracie and he can still do this to you I mean they showed what jiu-jitsu was all about it was awesome to watch that to see the difference but now you see even the sport of jiu-jitsu has really progressed there's guys that focus on that their whole lives and careers and you see them in jiu-jitsu sport compact and it's just a whole different level their orders of magnitude greater than some of the guys in the UFC going back to when you start training in an MMA gym and have these couple of quick fights at that point in time outside of your fitness and athleticism strength etc did you have any formal training in boxing kickboxing martial arts it was only referee wrestling I know I had let me correct myself when I was 17 I went with another wrestling teammate of mine we didn't want to do the tracker or any of that spring sports so we went into aka

[00:58:01] American Kickboxing Academy which is in San Jose at that time Frank Shamrock was the coach there this is today regarded as one of the most prolific training institutes of MMA in the world yeah still to this day but you just got lucky it's just happier in your backyard fortunate that it literally was in my backyard and we you know the first three months I went there that was that was about it I went there for three months and started training for football again it was awesome I loved it and I was just thinking like I'm gonna learn this stuff so I can kick more ass on the street you know that was really it and it'll keep me in shape and maybe help me be a better wrestler those kind of things but it took some time I mean once I got back into fighting well once I started fighting professionally and really trying to learn this stuff in large part

[00:58:46] I had forgotten a lot from wrestling and and most of the things that I learned at a.k when I was young so but also having learned how to be coachable was really just there to absorb as much as I could and out in Arizona we had some good guys it's not at the level that it is now you know you have some pretty great gyms out in Arizona these days but it was still still kind of young in terms of who you'd train with I didn't know that I'd fighting UFC or anything like that it was just fun for me and again you could think for the listener the UFC's like the NFL and you have an infinite number of other arena football leagues and all these other sorts of things and you could be playing in those leagues and maybe one day think you make it to the

[00:59:27] UFC or the NFL as it were yeah and that was the goal I mean over pride they were equal but I it wasn't my dream to play or fight in Japan for that matter I would have happily done it but I just kept knowing you know and I fought often I wasn't training nearly by the stand needed to be at so as I was built kind of in regular we used to standing at this zero

[00:59:49] I had no injuries at all early on in my career was only when I got to when I circled back so I was six and I was now fighting in king of the cage which you could look at as kind of a bridge between the two still a massive jump from king of the cage to the UFC but a lot of guys that fun that you have see had fought in king of the cages so how much you getting paid per fight a thousand dollars of fight and how frequently did they let you fight mmm was four times a year was the contract prior to that it was $100 a fight in rage in the cage it's just to give you a perspective a hundred dollars to go in and fight oh god that's even worse than boxing yeah it was yeah that's still in the I don't know what it is today you know that this is still when things were starting or relatively I mean it's not like I was fighting a 93 that's when it was starting got to six you know how to lost my first loss of my career in king of the cage what happened in that fine I really hadn't hadn't trained much for it because I was walking through people it was almost like Tyson and Buster Douglas you know and and my coach was trying to get me in there more and it was like yeah whatever you know on it you think of humbling experiences like I was just had my head in the clouds thought I was the [ __ ] thought I was gonna just walk through people until I got to the UFC then I'd really have to start training so I went into a fight I think was

[01:01:03] Laughlin Nevada and just got the [ __ ] beat out of me I mean it was the first time I got stung with a punch kneed me in the head it was Herb Dean who ref the fight he actually stopped the fight with me on my feet I was getting beat so bad I had a really good coach reaction I wanted that fight take mmm it happened in the first round it was a bad beating my striking coach trained under Dan

[01:01:22] Inosanto who was one of Bruce Lee's main students so he was a JKD guy and I learned JKD from one of Dan's six students that's amazing yeah this guy Vince Perez Missoula incredible human he he basically pulled me aside he said look I can teach you all of this stuff things that people aren't doing it in the UFC but you need more than me you need a team you need training partners and all my training partners were fought at 185 you know weight class underneath me or two weight classes underneath me and he was like you should go home in training a keg and they have a team they're great there's many great guys that fight in the UFC and that's where you ultimately want to go now so you should move home and at the same time my strength coach from ASU hit me up Joe Ken and he said Kings

[01:02:08] Barry I heard you're fighting right now you got to go back to a K what the [ __ ] are you doing and I was like I don't know coach I kind of like it here in Arizona he's like [ __ ] all that Kane's there so Kane was the the heavyweight wrestler at ASU he took fifth I think in an NC double-a his senior year in nationals and he's one of the greatest heavyweights of all time but he way he was only two and O at aka at the time so

[01:02:32] I moved back in with my dad and started training at a K largely just getting my ass beat every day until I could finally get my skills and endurance and everything up to par to be able to hang just to hang with Kane for one round we were rotating fresh bodies on him I mean it was a really hard entry point into what being a real pro looked like and how did you guys spar like a obviously very familiar with boxing where you can spar you using slightly larger gloves you've got headgear though I don't think headgear does much except prevent cuts and it's just a little easier to dial back the intensity but when it comes to elbows knees things like that like how are you sparring basically I 100% all the time so we weren't using elbows at the time if you had knee pads you could knee generally we wouldn't needed the head it was full go I mean it was it was a fight three days a week Monday Wednesday

[01:03:23] Friday you're in a fight period thankfully that we've seen the sport evolve and that's not really the case there's still some smaller gyms and backwoods areas that still spar like that it was a huge issue in the UFC for a long time fighters would get to camp they trained like animals that spar as hard as the fight was and then a week before the fight they get hurt or the week of the fight they would get hurt it was a real issue and I think it still happens now but thankfully people are being more mindful of the approach and also knowing once you have that level of experience and you've kind of weeded out who's not going to make it you can scale back and work technically you look at things like Muay Thai which is a form of kickboxing from Thailand they fight on a weekly basis so they're sparring is just touch and go it's highly technical they're never trying to hurt one another so I think we're gonna start to see that more and more in the sport of mixed martial arts I did Moutai for two years when I was in college and some of the most painful injuries I had were you know blank chin - in contact oh my god that's the only thing that hurt me in actually inside the Octagon in in a fight in the UFC was chin - in contact I could get drilled and actually touch canvas snap out of it and get back up and I wouldn't have felt the punch like a hard rib shot if I get the wind knocked out of me that hurts but the shin to shin that's the one where you're like wow I might not be able to walk tonight well I trained I was trained by a guy from Thailand who can I still remember his name - I'd love to I'd love to know what he's up to now but his name was Eric and his shins were so badly conditioned meaning so well conditioned for the concept of the sport that you could hit them with not all out but you could take a baseball bat and somewhat like just gently not gently but like with medium force whack his shins and he was unfazed at a level where even if you roll a baseball bat across a normal person's shin at the wrong angle it's very sensitive and yeah I was kind of like look I mean I'm done with trying to be a professional fighter here I go to college now I don't think I'm gonna do the work that's necessary to make my shins look like Eric's over there it's just in the home it's just it struck even though I didn't know much at the time I sort of knew like that's just the bridge too far right now but gives you an appreciation about supporting me just love I mean I love Thai boxing but we would spar mostly with really heavy equipment that would enable us to do this and we would focus on sort of different types of things like there were some days when it was just all gonna be low leg sweeps and you were gonna be in shin guards and you were really heavily guarded because I always felt the worst thing you could do is train at half speed because then it conditions you to be doing something at half speed you want to be able to be explosive so you just have to have more more barrier there when you're doing it but having never done mixed martial arts it's just nothing but all I have for how you have to be so prolific at so many things you can be a great striker and I can sort of relate to that because at least

[01:06:20] I know what those things I know what it would be like to be great at that I was never but I understand those sports well enough but then you think you could spend your whole life doing that and if you're a horrible grappler you'd get destroyed yeah and vice versa that's where it's at now for sure yeah I mean I think when you look at guys like Daniel Cormier and

[01:06:36] John Jones anybody who's great in the sport these days they came in with something already in their back pocket you know a lifelong wrestling pedigree or a lifelong and traditional martial arts pedigree and then they could just focus on these other things you only have so much bandwidth there's only so much time in the day to really learn and acquire new skills to polish them to feel comfortable enough to use that in a fight at full speed with all the pressure of people watching you and pay-per-view and that kind of stuff going on it's a lot and I started kind of late when you consider things thankfully I wasn't missing the athletic background but from the technical standpoint I entered the UFC as a white belt in jujitsu I mean there was there was gaping holes in my game that remained there until I finished while this whole new thing is going on how are you processing or what's the state of your mind with respect to this near-death experience you've had and the culmination of really kind of what's been going on since you were a kid like has this has this now back-burnered and sort of been supplanted by a new addiction and so to speak yeah for sure

[01:07:37] I think having something to look forward to and train for and and really some level of meaning of what I want to do I didn't obviously know it wasn't gonna fight for the rest of my life I'd already experienced that in football but this kind of gave me a second go at it that as a professional athlete in that as I was working towards being the best that I possibly could those are the things really they they weren't coming up for me because I also had an outlet if I was feeling weird inside and I go and [ __ ] punch someone's lights out like that's a good feeling right like it's letting the let out it was a great outlet in tandem there was a couple catalysts big catalysts that changed my life forever one I started working with a sports psychologists who introduced me to breath work and some level of mindfulness and the idea was because I mean early on in my fight career there was there was no issues I had ultimate confidence I was going to walk through people but now I'm at the UFC all these people are are as good you know as me if not better and that negative monkey mind chatter that comes up it was non-stop so how do

[01:08:42] I control that and the breath was really my first entry point into quieting my mind and finding some level of stillness at least right before the fight and this was holotropic know we would do various forms of slow breathing trying to get down into parasympathetic so at least two to one exhale to inhale for seconds in seven seconds hold eight seconds out things like that or 10 10 10 10 in 10 out or 10 in 10 hold 10 out and those were I mean fairly basic forms of breath work but I could feel the difference and practicing that right when I woke up and right before I went to bed helped me sleep at night because there was I mean it's one thing to say I'll fight a guy on a certain date but you signed a contract every day up until that date happens it's very hard to sleep cannabis helped me with that to specifically tht not just CBD but there was a lot that helped me there to actually fall asleep breath work being a big component of that the second piece that really was a game changer was a boxing coach that I had who was Native American and Mexican and he would take me to the reservation to do traditional sweat lodges so we do the Timmons call before every fight camp started to kind of zero in on what we wanted and after every fight for healing and reflection and it wasn't long before

[01:09:55] I just kind of looked at him and I said coach when are we gonna use lumidee Cena and he just started laughing and he said I've been waiting for you to ask and we started working with psilocybin had you ever done it before I had done it before highly inappropriately you know how to how the card relationally yeah at a house party on alcohol and cannabis with a bunch of people I didn't know and ultimate horror stories ultimate horror stories but this is my first real introduction to use intention to have respect and reverence for the plants being used and in a completely safe and perfect environment you know there's no running water no lights you're just out in nature you know and it's just my coach there watching me and maybe a couple other fighters and really that's where I started to begin to uncover some things in really sort not too much from the childhood but really getting direction and a true sense of peace inside that was lasting and at a certain point I had a friend go down to Peru he was gonna hike

[01:10:55] Machu Picchu and I was like that's awesome and tell me how it goes when you get back so he actually calls me early and I'm like aren't you in Peru and he's like yeah yeah I just got here but here's the thing I can either hike Machu Picchu or I can go do this thing called ayahuasca it's gonna take five days to do either and I was like hi kwacha Picchu why are you even calling me that's why you went there he's like no you got to look it up so I went to erowid org I'm not sure if you're familiar with the site it's got every drug from caffeine to meth in there including all plant medicines they give the pharmacology of it they give the chemistry of it they give the legality of it and there's trip reports so I remember pulling up a trip report from from ayahuasca and the first thing it was titled it's at the apex of teacher plans and I thought hmmm maybe there is something to this and so I asked my coach if he would come with me to Peru because I didn't speak Spanish well and I wanted in there and he's guided me and every meaningful experience I've had thus far and he said

[01:11:50] I'll bring Peru to us and we found people that would work with ayahuasca with us locally and that was an absolute game changer that's where I mean it that shifted more things in me on how I perceived the world and then anything else in terms of a catalyst for that and again you know I guys we talked about before it's not to glorify these substances there's a right way and a wrong way to do anything but under that guidance in that setting with that medicine no doubt some of the most powerful changes in the way I view consciousness my spirituality were you still fighting while you were experimenting maybe I was I was introducing when I was using psilocybin when I got introduced ayahuasca and to be clear I was using psilocybin from then on still to this day not often but yeah still using psilocybin when I was introduced ayahuasca I had just torn my labrum it was after a brutal fight

[01:12:44] Nottingham England where I had my orbital my left orbital blown out for a second time and my left eyebrow was fractured from a head kick in that fight and it was my third loss in a row I had always said if I get to be a 500 fighter at any level then I'll quit because it's it's not [ __ ] baseball you know and I am taking damages if somebody can punch me hard enough in the face to break bones it's taking its toll in my brain at that point I had some time off I mean I tore my labrum it's it took me it was a year to fully recover from that how are you supporting yourself at this point are you making enough in the UFC I was not making enough in the UFC even when I was fighting so I lived in my mom's detached garage for probably the last four and a half years I was there and I worked at a pseudo strip club it was a bikini bar out in Sunnyvale has a bouncer a manager and bartender and I'd go in twice a week thankfully going on weekends and pull off 211 hour shifts losing sleep of course not in the best environment but I still have a lot of gratitude because that put food on the table the entire time I was fighting at that point sponsorships were starting to be pulled people know or maybe not but there was a

[01:13:50] Reebok deal that UFC did and they no longer allowed us to have our own personal sponsors so money was being taken out from under our feet left and right and it was really important that I had a side job while I was fighting so the ayahuasca started when you were in this year of the torn labrum correct so you were three you've lost three what's your record in total at this point mm in the UFC I was four and four so winning record overall but foreign for I think 11 and 11 and four at that point okay guys so you're at a real crossroads which is am i retiring from this or do I have one more hurrah left in me yeah and

[01:14:24] I wasn't getting super clear on that from ayahuasca I don't think it was my intention to make that decision until I had repaired my shoulder and was able to train again but all of the important things in my life were coming up for me the deep work I mean everything from childhood stuff to how it treated myself with drugs and alcohol you know seeing seeing those patterns come up I remember I was I was in

[01:14:47] Colombia getting ready to do it and they told us we were gonna use a plant they use a lot of different add mixtures but there was this plant of a thousand ants they said what do you call it that and said what we're gonna rub it on you in the middle of night it feels like a thousand dancer fighting you and so I kind of chuckled and I said what does it do they said you're gonna think of a negative emotion that you want to remove could be anger could be sadness could be whatever just something that keeps coming up for you and I said anger and when we got in a long conversation about that but they'd also talked before that ceremony about alcohol addiction and cannabis addiction and immediately I thought oh this is for everyone else like I'm good this is for everyone else and and you know it does affect a lot of people I know and so I just thought of it that way and then a great chunk of that night was me reliving puking violently over a railing in my chonies and telling my sister to get away from me you know I didn't want people around to see me like that and I had countless nights like that and even when I was fighting in the UFC it was really a polarized way to live in fight camp I was a perfect little angel I wouldn't watch TV I would read every night trying to study things that would help me in fighting from mobility to die nutrition you name it eating super clean food and then the second the fight is over it's whoppers and alcohol and blow and whatever I can get my hands on so that went back and forth for a while up until this ceremony I was like wow okay time to scale back outside of camp and really treat myself better it's so interesting when you look at this statistics I'm borrowing a lot of this so the numbers might I might be a little bit off cuz it's been a while since I've I've read it but maybe you've heard me talk about it in the past one of the most important books I've ever read in my life is this book called I don't want to talk about it we do we talk about this in Hawaii we must I think so yeah by Terrence real and he talks so much about the difference between covert and overt depression so overt depression is what most people think about when they think of depression it's the person who can't get out of bed who's weepy who's unmotivated you know overeating under eating you know your classic picture of depression the person who's sitting there morose and their psychiatrist office or whatever and then there's covert depression which is the same underlying pain but it manifests itself typically with addiction anger aggression workaholism you know all sorts of other things that are numbing this sort of discomfort and one of the statistics that teri talks about in the book that just blew my mind because it's so obvious when he says it like I didn't think I guess what I realized was I can't believe I never thought of this before but he talks about the stark contrast between men and women so when you look at for example what's the proportion of men in prison versus women in prison it's something about you know it's like 93 percent of incarcerated people in the United States are men not women rates of alcoholism you know it's about 20% in men and again

[01:17:44] I could be directionally I could be a little bit off but directionally it's you know it's about 3 to 1 in favor of men for alcohol abuse obviously you know 9 to 1 in prison drug abuse violence all of these things are vastly more in men than in women but when you look at women with clinical diagnosis of depression versus men with a clinical diagnosis depression it's the opposite it's disproportionately men and he goes through this exercise in his book of adding up the absolute numbers what's the absolute number of women that are receiving therapy for depression that have issues with alcohol drugs violence etcetera etc do the same exercise for men it turns out it's the same number what's the difference the difference is the form in which it exists and this just sort of blew my mind right which is all of this time like you know whether it's you me I I think this is my anger issue or this is my addiction or whatever it is and you realize what's underpinning that is the same pain that in a woman might lead to depression that we will label in a certain way and we're not seeing it this way and so this is kind of listen to your story is so interesting because I'm just sort of watching the arc of numbing vehicles to numb pain if it's not this drug it's the pursuit of this sport and if it's not that it's this fight if it's this thing and it's interesting just it sounds like the ayahuasca became along with the psilocybin became one of the first sets of tools these plants that and I don't put words in your mouth so if I'm not right now he's nodding my head yes right now it sounds like that was the first time when you finally saw through the [ __ ] of you're on a hedonic loop a treadmill of one next fix after another and again it's so common in men especially that like we're sort of drawn to using our body as a shield right like the bigger and stronger and tougher you are the more that seven year old is not going to hurt which it's again when you say it that way it sounds so stupid but that's because we're now sitting here talking and like like it's a rational thought and not realizing that there's a wounded kid that had to come up with sort of a set of skills to adapt to a situation and those adaptations were actually very positive for the large part they saved you right they prevented you probably from jumping off a balcony when you were seven but they start to become maladaptive and it's it to me this is the stuff that's interesting is this transition from adaptive to maladaptive and it starts to come crashing down yeah I mean it peels back layers they talk about the infinite onion every time you go and that's that something that's something that really resonates with me you listen to people like Dennis McKenna and gob r'mante people I find fascinating is that they've done hundreds of ceremonies and it's completely unique each time they go and I say ceremony because of the respect and reverence that's used when they utilize these plants but it's the fact that if I give enough space between ceremonies and I come back and have a reason to be there that's important to me I'm gonna get a lot that has to do with that and maybe even more than what

[01:20:47] I came for and that peeling back at the layer really shows such a deep reflection of what's going on inside right now and it also has shown me the ways that I behave due to how I was programmed it just blows my mind we just got back from Satara we did another four ayahuasca ceremonies there about three weeks ago and each one just took me oh I took me in a different place again they were completely unique from one another and I continue to learn how to work with it you know it's continuing to evolve and I listening to guys like Dennis like that that will continue on well past 100 ceremonies have you had some really negative ones am i negative oh yeah all of you at that by saying highly highly unpleasant yeah so all happy to jump in is one of the hardest nights of my life was in

[01:21:38] Colombia and you know ayahuasca has a visual component where you can have quote unquote visions it's like a in a dreamlike state often times they're very personal what you see there was a night where I had none of that and all of the purgative effects of ayahuasca so I [ __ ] water violently bear made it to the bathroom the entire night didn't sleep one minute puke violently the whole night it was incredibly hard but it was in many ways cleaning me out and that's I think what

[01:22:05] I needed at that point now that's physiologically unbearable but have you had I mean I've had one experience on ayahuasca that was emotionally unbearable and I'm gonna get right yeah yeah those are the ones that interesting having had a night like that generally speaking for the most part and I've done now 26 ceremonies with ayahuasca there would be some level of back and forth so if I had a really challenging time physically I could purge and then I'd feel euphoria if I had some challenge emotionally maybe I'm reliving some hard memory from my past I would see within the same time span you know within I don't know 30 minutes that that other side of that coin and see the beauty in it and realize all the things that it gave me and understand it with a new perspective my second to last night and Costa Rica recently at Satara was for sure the hardest none of my life I had my first dose early on and didn't feel a whole lot and it was very peaceful and then I asked for a second dose and it was my intention for healing and I remember asking and then you can argue one way or another what how much intention plays plays a role in this I think it plays a huge role but I remember opening the door to any and all emotional and mental healing and if there's anything left from my childhood because now I'm 37 I've done a number of ceremonies with ayahuasca and even higher a number with psilocybin and other MDMA have met many things and I've worked through well a great deal of stuff with my childhood so I didn't think there was a whole lot left and I just asked like if there's anything remaining from my childhood please show me it was [ __ ] everything it was the entire night I made it back to the room ceremony had ended and it kicked off into a whole second ceremony and it was almost unbearable at many points I remember just begging for mercy like please I've seen enough let's let's we can run this back at different time like any trying to rationalize or beg for a way out so I wouldn't have to keep seeing this and in the pain of just a small picture of this sometimes if I was to have a vision it's like watching from the third-person or watching a movie and I can see from a different lens this was like reliving it for the first time through your lens through my lens first person like it was happening to me the exact same feelings

[01:24:26] I was feeling as a 6 or 7 year old or 15 year old in that moment all the fear of my father my mom screaming at me an inch from my face and spit flying into my mouth things like just it was in credits so real but it just kept going and going and going and I realized holy [ __ ] like all that still there finally as the Sun came up I just kind of surrendered to it and that's one of these cornerstones that I've learned through working with the plants is you're not in control I'm not in control anytime I do these things

[01:25:00] I can I have some level of direction but really what I'm being shown is for me it's not happening to me so the ability to surrender that and let go of trying to change it really helped and then having a degree of gratitude from my parents knowing they were doing the best they could with what they could at that time and also seeing how hard it was for them growing up and then seeing my son that's really where it shifted so might we have a four-year-old son named bear and seeing him and realizing like that's where it ends like that's where it ends we all want to do better for our kids than what we were given and applies to everything from finances to education to what kind of person they become but knowing that he will never experience what I experienced what my dad experienced and my granddad experienced that generational pain is going to be gone with him and seeing that I had so much gratitude for him and just knowing like okay this breaks here like that was really cool and second I thought that it all washed away and I felt euphoria and

[01:26:02] I felt gratitude and I just it was for sure the hardest night of my life and one of the most beautiful in the end by far there's not much to add to that because it's funny I had made a note on my page to kind of come back to this point all I had written down was break cycle son do you feel that part of your edge is gone as a result of this

[01:26:23] Jurnee yeah there was a fire that was in you before that was partially constructive partially destructive and you sort of were balancing those two things there were moments when the destructive side was winning and then there were moments when the you know constructive side is winning but it's hard to look at most professional fighters and not realize how much pain unfortunately is at the root of why they're doing what they're doing it's very difficult I think to put yourself in the position of getting in a ring and fighting I know this because I did it you've done it you've done a professional I never did it professionally there's so much pain that predisposes a person to be willing to do that now I'm sure there are exceptions to this I'm sure there were like people with the most wonderful childhoods who have ended up becoming fighters but I used to study boxing at a level that who would would border on me getting an honorary PhD for it and I can't actually think of an example of a professional boxer that I'd studied who wasn't fueled by some awful thing that had happened to them you know it can be something little but oftentimes it was not right often times it was generational and misery do you sort of feel a bit remote now from that sport in the way I mean I'm sure you still enjoy it but do you also I mean is your relationship with it complicated as a result of this new insight or it's these new insights

[01:27:40] I mean I'm I for sure have let go for a long time after retiring I've retired five years ago this month actually and I knew I wasn't gonna fight again but I still loved the sport I wanted to watch every fight never missed a fight trained I didn't do striking because I knew that would lead me to fighting again but I did a lot of jiu-jitsu competed in a couple times and I think now I would call myself a casual fan you know I still all the guys that I used to train with a take a I'll watch them when they fight it's on ESPN a lot now so I'll watch that too if it's on TV but I don't like schedule stuff like aw man the so-and-so's fighting I gotta stop everything you know like if I catch it great if I don't it's not a big deal to me it didn't necessarily change the way

[01:28:24] I look at fighting I have a lot of gratitude for what fighting gave me and while fighting taught me and I feel very fortunate that I retired at 32 years old and retired without the catastrophic injuries that many people leave with yeah yeah and that's huge you know I want to be able to read to my son and any all of our children and chase them around and play and be be the dad I want to be you know but with with that chip on my shoulder yeah that's that's for sure washed away I mean I remember when

[01:28:52] I first started fighting I just wanted to there's that there's a line in Fight Club and forgive me if you've heard me talk about this before but there's a line of Fight Club where Edward Norton's character beats the [ __ ] at a dairy Leto the blonde guy and Brad Pitt looks at Edward Norton he says what the [ __ ] is wrong with you and he just says I just wanted to destroy something beautiful that's it like that resonate with me I wanted to beat the [ __ ] out of people and the overtime that shifted to I just want to be the best version of myself and then now I see that still being the case but it's from a much different lens like what being the best version of myself is applies to so many more things outside I've had lettuce ISM and I think that's a likely transition for people who have started to age and whatever you know there's a lot of older people like you have an age you're 37 but I feel different than when I was 27 sure no doubt 37 year old athletes an old athlete so you're not even halfway down life and yet the last four or five years have probably been some of the most important not that it's necessarily productive or constructive do you ever ask yourself the question like what do you think you'd be doing right now if you hadn't had this fortuitous set of events meeting the right boxing coach being introduced to the plant medicine and being able to sort of extract from it what it gives you because I don't think the plants are neat they they don't give you little turnkey just take this it's all okay it's really messy it's really messy work and it's as much about the work you do before and after as it is what you do under the direct influence of the plant but but if you hadn't been as lucky as you've been to experience that I mean what's the 37 year old former UFC fighter doing who hasn't worked through the issues you had because there's a lot of those guys out there I know I'm this isn't about the

[01:30:37] UFC this is like maybe someone who's never thrown a punch in their life but they're still suffering from the same pain yeah a lot of I mean I think the cliche thing to say is dead or in jail I don't think that applies to me I think I'd really turn the corner but I wouldn't say it's far-fetched to think that I'd still be fighting and some low-level show getting the [ __ ] kicked out of me losing brain cells I sure wouldn't be with Natasha and my wife I mean in many ways we were together for about a year before we did ayahuasca for the first time and it like that changed the course of our relationship it unpacked so much of the arguing that we had allowed me to see things in myself that she could but I could not and vice versa as we grew as individuals we grew together in our relationship and there's no way that would have worked out how do I just continue to fight and treat myself the way that it was you know and so I think that's that's a pretty if I look at probabilities that's probably that probably the highest probability is that

[01:31:37] I'd still be fighting somewhere making peanuts and taking them get hurt yeah I couldn't hurt regularly how does all this sort of shape the way you think about raising your son because you alluded to the most important morning a moment ago which is if nothing else the cycle of pain and then and shame and trauma and all that stuff at least it stops with with you now to bear but what else do you think about as far as like because now it's beyond not just having him be hurt but showing him something yeah can I give him you know in the world and I think a lot of things fascinate me people talk [ __ ] about the

[01:32:13] Paleo diet and that's fine and what did paleo man actually eat and all that and yeah I get it I get it from both sides but to think through the lens of how our ancestors lived that fascinates me this is a he giant test and it's a huge test of what we're doing now for with everything that's in the modern world it's being done for the very first time what are the ways that we can kind of reconnect to our roots and still live in the modern world and I think when I think about things like that what are the most important pieces that I've learned or what are the most important pieces that I'm learning about now I want him to have some degree of confidence and I think martial arts is really good for that I don't necessarily want him to fight but that's his decision it'll always be his decision even if he says [ __ ] martial arts I want to play piano and that's totally cool I have to let go of that but still giving him the ability to to try all these things and see what he enjoys he loves I mean he's athletic both me and my wife were both athletes so it's not confusing to me but you know he's he's doing jiu-jitsu now it's pretty early but it's kind of the equivalent of tumbling or gymnastics and he absolutely loves it and our wrestle time is probably the most fun you know we have a hundred square feet of MMA mats in our living room so we can do yoga we can roll we can do whatever and in rough house and and we can play soccer or frisbee or and those are all things that he loves but he doesn't love anything as much as wrestling me so like and getting to him into jiu-jitsu now it's uh it's pretty cool to see that I don't know how long that's gonna last it really doesn't matter getting back to this ancestral stuff I think it's critical that we at least try to find some rite of passage especially for our young men to bring them into adulthood and I think that been Greenfields buddy Tim Corcoran he's doing a lot of good stuff he has these wilderness survival camps for father and son when the kids are old enough he takes them out there and they're a game they're solo you know or they're in a small group and it's just him kind of watching over and they they learned how to build fires they learn how to feel safe in the environment they learned how to forage for wild mushrooms and different things that they can survive on and I think that's an incredible piece taking it a step further and again if we're having that conversation with the DEA sitting on the couch I don't know that I'd say this but I think it's it's a very strong likelihood that I'll be taking him to the Amazon or maybe not me maybe uncle Aubrey will or somebody else because oftentimes that was the case and rite of passage year the kids would have to leave their parents and go off with the elders the aunties the uncles and go through their work and I think having a close unco like that who also has experience with these things taking into the Amazon for a rite of passage with something like ayahuasca would be really transformative in powerful form and to most people hearing about this for the first time they're gonna be like that's [ __ ] nonsense like that and you're right you lost me here but I know quite a few people who are some of the most beautiful humans

[01:35:09] I've ever met that did that perang he being one of them he's an incredible musician one of the most kind-hearted people I've ever met and he his first ceremony was when he was 11 so it's not to say that happens for everyone but again if you understand set and setting and two are really good practitioners and that's something I say a lot of times is there's black belts and there's white belts and martial arts there's black belts teaching ayahuasca and white belts teaching and there's everything in between and some people spend a week in the Amazon and come back and say I'm gonna give this to all my friends and everyone I know and it can have really bad consequences from that so you know having a place that that has been vetted at least by somebody you respect and know I think is critical when it comes to these things because as

[01:35:55] Aubrey says you're performing psychic surgery and not done incorrectly can leave some really lasting damage but correctly it can be everything that I see in it everything that Dennis sees in it yeah and and anyone listen to this who has not yet read Michael Pollan's how to change your mind to have such a great storyteller and a great writer take on such an important topic I think it's hard to come away from that without realizing that there's there's a lot here that we need to understand better but the the promise is enormous yeah yeah and we do need to understand it better there's no doubt under those circumstances I think I can give to him a lot of things I you remember being in high school thinking maybe you didn't because you had boxing but I remember being in high school thinking like nothing is more important than this than how I'm perceived by my peers status things like that popularity who my friends are what kind of girl I'm gonna date and like when the world ends I went crap on graduation day what am I gonna do and those kind of things and there's a lot of weight and heaviness to that environment especially now when you see kids that are glued to their iPad and you got eight-year-olds with cellphones and things like that it's it's really hard to get them to unplug and to see the big picture and I think I think a medicine like that could be really important to reconnect them to what matters and you get them to see what the wider lens to things that matter to them at that point in time I think it could be a great tool for young people it's amazing how has your relationship come full circle with your parents I mean is that is it just this incredible place of forgiveness is it still difficult it's funny you say that because right after this ceremony or a series of ceremonies in Satara in Costa Rica my wife and I flew back to the Bay Area where our son is being watched by my family and then we all flew out to parts of Iraq tough for a family vacation and there's a famous quote from Terrance I think it's Terence Mckenna no it's Ron das where if you think you're enlightened spend a week with your hair that's like [ __ ] man I went from one ceremony to the next and it came with its own set of challenges for sure but as far as my relationship goes

[01:38:01] I have a great deal of compassion for them I've also learned from the medicines that everyone walks their own path it's not up for me to decide how or when they should learn their lessons and just as it was the case with me and my wife I can't always see what's going on where I'm where I'm [ __ ] up everyone has a blind spot so somebody that's close to you might be able to see what's going on and you better than you can and it certainly was the case in my relationship and I can see all the faults that my parents have that they don't see but it's not up to me to decide that they will learn their own lessons at their own pace and they may go to the grave without having learned some lessons that's okay I'm for sure gonna do the same thing but that compassion to me that's one of the most powerful parts of the story is to feel and experience empathy for another person who may have indirectly or directly hurt you and to realize wow they didn't mean to hurt me or even if they did mean to hurt me which is not the case I think in your situation but this is the set of circumstances for them and that sounds crazy right that sounds like we should accept you know horrible things that people have done to us but in reality what's your choice yeah and something that I've gathered - is forgiveness has very little to do with the person I'm forgiving it has everything to do with taking that [ __ ] weighted vest off of me because I'm held down by that whatever anger or pain or resentment that I feel towards another person the longer I hold on to that they might not even [ __ ] know it might not be on their radar but I'm keeping that in me and it's affecting the way that I go through the world so if I can release that what greater gift can I give to myself let alone the other person I'm forgiving well I want to thank you for being you know so open about such difficult topics there were a whole bunch of other things I thought we were going to talk about that were super nerdy and science and stuff but I get to talk about that stuff all the time this was I thought this was far more interesting far more value and I honestly I think more people will will find this resonance so I really appreciate it awesome brother thanks for having me a
