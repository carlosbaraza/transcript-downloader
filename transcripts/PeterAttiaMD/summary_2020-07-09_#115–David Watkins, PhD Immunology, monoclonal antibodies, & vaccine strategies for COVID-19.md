## Description

Original release date: 6/15/20

In this episode, David Watkins, professor of pathology at George Washington University, shares how insights from his HIV and Zika virus research could apply to SARS-CoV-2 protection strategies. David introduces monoclonal antibodies as an intervention to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection, and also discusses how they could be used as a hedge to vaccine development. Additionally, David’s immunology tutorial explains the innate and adaptive immune systems and their differentiated responses to viral infection.

We discuss:
00:00:00 - Intro
00:04:30 - Background and current interest in immunology  
00:10:15 - Immunology 101—The innate and adaptive immune system 
00:19:00 - Defining antibodies, importance of neutralizing antibodies, and serology testing for COVID-19  
00:25:00 - B cells—How they fight viruses, create antibodies, and fit into the vaccine strategy  
00:36:15 - T cells—Role in the adaptive immune system and ability to kill infected cells to prevent viral spread 
00:51:00 - Valuable lessons from HIV applied to SARS-CoV-2  
01:01:30 - Lessons to be taken from the hepatitis C success story  
01:04:45 - Monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and the most promising strategy for preventing and treating COVID-19 infection  
01:19:00 - COVID-19 vaccines in development  
01:25:20 - How David’s work with Zika virus informs his thinking on SARS-CoV-2  
01:27:45 - Why a vaccine for COVID-19 doesn’t need to be perfect to be effective
