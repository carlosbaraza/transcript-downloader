Belinda Beck, founder of The Bone Clinic and a leading authority on exercise physiology and bone health, delves into the science of osteoporosis, bone density, and the lifelong importance of maintaining skeletal health. In this episode, she explains how the foundation for strong bones is established during childhood, offering valuable advice for parents on optimizing bone health for their kids. She also explores how bone remodeling occurs throughout life, driven by activity, nutrition, and hormones. Belinda highlights the power of resistance training in improving bone strength, even for those at risk of bone loss, and emphasizes the role of essential vitamins and minerals in maintaining bone health. She shares practical strategies, backed by research, for preventing fractures and combating osteoporosis.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Belinda Beck discussing bone health, osteoporosis prevention, and treatment through resistance training. The conversation centers around the groundbreaking "LIFTMOR" study, which demonstrated that high-intensity resistance training can significantly improve bone density and quality of life in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. The discussion covers bone physiology, the importance of early intervention in childhood, and practical approaches to maintaining bone health throughout life.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Bone density is 70-80% determined by genetics [21:19]
- Peak bone mass is typically achieved by late teens/early 20s [19:54]
- Estrogen withdrawal during menopause leads to accelerated bone loss for 5-8 years [23:59]
- The LIFTMOR study showed 4% net benefit in spine bone density after 8 months [31:51]
- Cortical thickness at femoral neck improved by 133% in intervention group [32:49]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Regular weight-bearing exercise throughout life [58:21]
- Adequate calcium intake (1000mg daily for teenagers) [32:53]
- Regular sun exposure for vitamin D synthesis [33:55]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Supervised resistance training for those with osteoporosis [1:44:56]
- Early intervention in childhood for optimal bone development [19:54]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Calcium: 1000mg daily for teenagers [32:53]
- Vitamin D: Levels should be maintained above 50 nmol/L [34:42]
- Consideration of HRT during perimenopause [1:07:46]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- High-intensity resistance training: 30 minutes, twice weekly [1:19:54]
- Compound movements including deadlifts and squats [1:20:54]
- Free weights preferred over machines [1:21:19]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Emphasis on calcium-rich foods, particularly dairy [32:53]
- Low-fat milk contains more calcium than full-fat [32:53]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- DEXA scan for bone density measurement [1:13:23]
- T-scores and Z-scores interpretation [1:14:22]
- Hip measurements more reliable than whole body scans [1:14:22]

8. **References & Resources**:
- LIFTMOR study [1:19:54]
- ONERO program for practitioners [1:43:28]
- The Bone Clinic website for finding certified providers [1:44:56]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Osteoporosis is a childhood disease" [19:54]
"Old people are you and me who just kept living longer" [1:21:19]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term sustainability of resistance training benefits
- Optimal training protocols for different age groups
- Role of nutrition timing in bone health
- Impact of different types of exercise on bone density

[00:00:00] so it was all about just systematically training them in the technique and uh and then gradually increasing the load and a lot of people think of older people and particularly older women and particularly postmenopausal women who you know the assumption is they go completely loopy through menopause which is not true um they think about old people as completely incapable incapable of doing stuff and incapable of learning but old people are you and me who just kept living longer it's we you know we have the capacity to learn and and older people are perfectly capable of learning how to do a deadlift in a squat you know it might be pretty ugly to start with but they get better and as they get stronger they get even better hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:58] AA hey Belinda thank you so much for getting up so early uh in Australia to sit down with me would uh would love to be doing this in person but it's a bit of a hike for you so um this will more than suffice um you know I've referenced uh your work many times before in in talking with patients and you know talking on social media talking another podcast and um so I've wanted to speak with you for some time because you know it's one thing to hear me talk about something but it's I think far better to hear the expert talk about it and as opposed to me just sort of paraphrasing um but maybe we'll just spend a second giving folks a little bit of your background uh I'll have obviously introduced you already um but but tell folks a little bit about how you kind of came to to find your your interest in this um you know your your your PhD and postdoc were both done here in the US correct yeah that's right uh and my masters as well actually

[00:02:00] I think we can safely say a lot of people end up in research because of some personal interest and that's exactly the case for me I was a runner and a field hockey player and I constantly suffered from s shins nobody could help me they couldn't even tell me why I was getting them much less how to prevent them or or make them better this was back in the day mind you uh and so even when I was in high school I knew that I wanted to find out what was going on and that's actually where my research started in my masters I was looking at um tial stress injuries it became clear very very early that this is a bone injury this is not what everybody was saying two hours posterior pulling on the border of the that was all bunkum that was somebody making a supposition and that set me down the PA path of trying to figure out what are the mechanical signals that stimulate bone to adapt to to Mechanical load you know pursuit of Wolf's Law why does a change in mechanical loading uh cause the bone to change shape in this amazing way and of course as soon as I discovered bone did that I was hooked because it is just an incredible tissue so then um when I I did an animal study for my

[00:03:16] PhD and quickly realized that that was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life because it involved killing animals constantly so I went I went to Stanford and did a post do and that's where I leared about clinical trials and sort of um then realized of course that osteoporosis is is the greatest burden when it comes to Bone problems and so being an exercise head that's something that I wanted to to figure out exactly what was the ideal exercise program to to assist people living with osteoporosis yeah and before we started the podcast we quickly figured out that we overla together at Stanford for the entire three years of your postto I was in medical school um which of course I I just get a kick out of knowing the fact that there was probably a day when we were literally in the same cafeteria at the VA or something and of course uh who would have predicted you know whatever more than 25 years later we're sitting here but that's that's I love those coincidences um so um let's also talk a little bit about what you're doing today so you're you're obviously back home um talk about the the the clinical practice that you have now and what type of patients you you you work with and and what type of research you're still focused on yeah okay so I should clarify

[00:04:38] I'm not a clinician I'm an exercise physiologist and uh I've never had a personal clinical load uh although exercise physiology is one of the Allied Health um uh professions in Australia uh I came back to Australia to an academic position and was I've been teaching Anatomy my whole professional career but continued my my bone research so I'm I'm a professor at Griffith

[00:05:05] University on the Gold Coast in Queensland and that's where um we sort of my career sort of I guess triangulated onto this question of there must be a way to load people who have osteoporosis in such a way that they can grow bone because everybody had been saying we couldn't do that because their bones were so fragile now when we did and I'm sure we'll come back to the actual trials we did that showed that um after I showed that I did realize that the exercise the nature of the exercise was not um really safe for just anybody and it needed to be applied in a certain way and very specifically and it needed to be applied by somebody who really knew what they were doing because this is not a program that should be done unsupervised if you at high risk of fracture and the only way to do that was to implement it in a clinic now it's hard enough to convince doctors who've been telling patients osteoporotic patients for years that they should not lift anything heavy but but to tell somebody in a clinic to start doing this exercise you I just knew that was never going to happen so that's what the bone clinic is I set up a clinical facility it's a translational research facility where we actually implemented the program but every patient that comes in uh is a research participant and they agree to share their data um we do the same testing as we did in the limore trial it's 2 and a half hour appointment at Baseline and then every year thereafter we test them again with the same thing so that we can see if the exercise program works in in the real world and of course um I added in other things that are really important like diet and um and we take care of them this is not a clinical trial this is we don't have a control group now of course I've got an enormous amount of data and uh and needing to uh Wade through all of that well let's let's start the discussion with um a little bit of the physiology of the bone right it's um I think for many people myself included right people who you know went to medical school we don't I don't really recall getting much of an education in this I probably did but it's it you know once you choose your specialty you know you you if unless it happens to deal with bones um as in orthopedic surgery or Rheumatology perhaps um or maybe Sports Medicine you know most of us and end up kind of getting far and Far away from it but um given the ubiquity of osteopenia and osteoporosis um it it really comes back to be in the four uh uh for for many physic even if they aren't trained in it so so

[00:08:02] I think it'll be helpful for everyone myself included to go over a little bit of bone physiology um so handle it any way you see fit um but but I think you know we we can we can talk about this in as much depth as as as you like because uh we have a we have a pretty sophisticated audience okay so exposes a couple of different ways to look at types of bone the very basic way to to describe them according to their shape and which is completely related to their function uh the whole basis of w Flor I guess um so you have long bones like the long bones the levers in your limbs um and your and your your feet and hands uh you have short bones like the little uh lumpy bones in your ankles and wrist you have irregular bones like your vertebrae and your um scapular and so on um all of them are comprised of Two basic kinds of bone one is cortical bone and one is tracular bone and there are different way different words for those cortical or compact bone tracular spongy or um uh cancellous bone now cortical bone is typically uh the shell of a bone every bone has cortical bone on the outside it might be very thin in the case of vertebral bone or it might be extremely thick as in the shaft of you know the diaphysis of the femur um most Bones have some degree of tracula or tacular bone in them if it's a long bone it's in the ends uh and if it's a short bone it fills the whole thing if like a vertebrae IR regular bone it also fills the whole body of an regular bone if it's in the skull it's called Diplo and it's sandwiched in between two layers of cortical bone um yeah ribs even even have Diplo they're flat bone as well so um the very cool thing about the bone tissue itself is the micro structure so in cortical bone you have an A Lamela structure so layers and layers of bone and that occurs because of the way osteoblasts lay down bone but the really cool thing is the fact that in each adjacent layer the the collagen is laid down almost not perfectly perpendicular to each other so that this these this um theame combine to create a a a tissue that is beautifully resistant to torsion as well as the normal loading of compression and um and tension now in tracular bone there are also some lame because of the way osteoblast produce bone but the really cool thing about tracular bone and this is I think probably what wolf in 1882 spent most of your time trying to describe mathematically is the arrangement of the tul so each individual strut is best aligned to the N to the forces that are put on bone if you look at a cross-section through the proximal femur you'll see that these there're those wonderful arches that go all the way from the head through the neck and down past the gra tranta and then from the great tranta there are Tuli that come from the the surface of the tranter and

[00:11:31] Arch down uh to the other side and over towards the Lesser tranter so you get this interconnection of bone that is beautifully arranged to best withstand the bending load that you will get from the opposition of the weight of the body on the head of the bone and the ground reaction force coming up the diaphysis so that repeats itself throughout the body if you look at any part of the body where tcul are they are just a aligned uh in response to the forces and of course that's one of the things that will change if you change the nature of the loading you've mentioned Wolf's Law a couple of times uh probably worth stating it and uh explaining its relevance to to Bone so it has been paraphrased over the years and I don't think there's any harm in that to mean that bone will adapt to the nature of loading to which it is chronically exposed and the purpose being that it's best adapted to withstand forces to prevent fracture in actual fact um I couldn't recount what his actual law is because he was a mathematician and he was trying to describe this mathematically we've taken that notion and just encapsulated it into that uh that law of bone adaptation in response to loading now is there a built-in assumption to Wolf's Law that that that adaptation can only happen in the setting of certain physiologic parameters being met so um for example like sufficient calcium um you know healthy osteoblasts like you know absence of certain disease pathology or is this truly a universal law that is indeed axiomatic I don't think anybody knows the answer to that for sure but I would be willing to stake my firstborn on don't tell her uh that this is this just occurs this is something that happens as as sand running out of your fingers falls to the ground to toward because of gravity this is how bone reacts to loading it's a physical uh phenomenon okay you've also alluded to osteoblast so maybe talk a little bit about the difference between an osteoblast and an osteoclast how this mineral makes its way to the

[00:14:03] Bone what does this look like as a child is is born like maybe even start at Birth and talk about what what the bones are like in that fetus and how they develop over the the ensuing uh you know two decades yeah okay so we're going right back we we start um as a little cynist uh model of a skeleton and even by eight weeks um we have that model in that tiny little bean uh and that is um progressively mineralized uh as the as the skele as it becomes skeleton uh there is there there are two different ways really as of alific but the primary one is uh endochondral um once a baby is born they have um ossified the long bones and uh quite a portion of their skull bones and most of the other bones that are around organs that and just for folks listening aifi is this process of putting mineral into the cartilage and turning it from sort of soft into hard right that's right I think uh when we talk about alific when bone cells invade the cartilage once there's a bone cell in there it's it's considered to be aifi because they start to excrete osteoid which then becomes mineralized so yeah that's right um there is a yeah there's the whole process of endocrinal alific um so yeah babies are not born obviously fully aifi they have still little cartilagenous hands and feet and they have lots of cartilage just to different degrees in their in their skull bones and those continue to oopy throughout life and I think in fact some of our um our growth plates don't even fuse until particularly in men till they're about 25 years old um but largely you know most of your bones are fully formed and and have bone in them by the time you're you're two um and that's coinciding with when you're really starting to run around and load the skeleton um the skeleton then continues to grow throughout L throughout the uh first two decades with the vast majority of growth happening when when you're very little little toddlers And but primarily during puberty and that's what we all know as the gross birth and that's happening because your bones are gr like crazy that begins to slow um that that grow spurt happens earlier in in girls probably about 12 um probably about 13 14 in boys and it slows probably is ending round about 18 in girls can be as late as 25 in boys um and once you have reached your Peak bone uh growth there your your epiphyses have joined to your diaphyses so the growth plates are fused you're not going to grow anymore and you'll almost certainly have all the bone that you're ever going to have so there's definitely a making hay while the sunshines uh Mantra of those of us who work in the world of osteoporosis bigest childhood is uh so incredibly important people often call osteoporosis a childhood disease the goal is to get as much bone as you possibly can that's limited by your genetics and we come back and talk about that if you want but you do have a blueprint that that you will achieve but you want to optimize that get as much of that genetic capacity as you have sir I just want to repeat that point Belinda because it's actually quite profound um and I want to make sure nobody missed it you said osteoporosis is a childhood disease now what you meant by that of course is based on what you said just prior to that which is you will reach your maximum bone potential by the time your growth plates fuse which again for most people is probably late teens maybe in the case of uh men early 20s and you know in that sense it's sort of like a glider right it's sort of like saying this glider will re its maximum altitude 20 years into your 80 or 90e life and you better get it really really high because the best we can do is reduce the rate at which it declines but we're not going to get it higher than it was at that point um now we're going to get into a whole bunch of nuance I'm sure later on because I think what you're going to tell us is that actually we can maybe even change the elevation of the glider later on in these patients with osteoporosis but I think there's no denying this idea that anybody listening to this who's thinking about osteoporosis for themselves should also be thinking about it for their kids and asking the question what are my 10year olds 12y olds 15y olds doing today to reach their genetic potential yeah there it's one of the strongest messages that I I speak mainly to older people and I say you know this the horse may have bolted for you but you have children and grandchildren and this should be your Mantra get them outside and active every single day and doing you know XYZ bone friendly activities I should say you know we talk about Pig bone mass being achieved and we we use the word um end of the second decade because that's the average between men and women but it can creep up a little bit but most I I don't nobody is growing any more bone after age 30 and most people are well and truly done by then um so yes I what I'm

[00:20:10] I'm probably giving a somewhat old-fashioned view of this because as you say I do believe that there is capacity to uh get the glider higher later in life but um I guess the concept is you're not going to grow bone anymore you're not going to grow the length of bone anymore so it becomes a lot more difficult and the other message that is extremely important is that genes determine you know it's been sort of 70 to 80% of the bone that you're going to have so to a certain extent you're working within some reasonably tight bounds you only have to look at your um your parents and grandparents to get an idea of what your risk is like if they are very osteoporotic then your risk is also very high so I think you said 60 to 70 or did you say 70 to 80% I know it was a high high range you gave there well it does depend on who you read but um I sort of have settle on the 70 to 80% because uh

[00:21:19] I I think that there is certainly evidence to say that's the case there are twin studies and and so on and and sorry that's bone density as well obviously bone length is highly heritable right just as height is very heritable and it's determined by bone length but you you're also referring to bone density by referencing osteoporosis correct yeah I suppose I mean I probably prefer to use the word bone mass the trouble is we measure it by bone density using a bone mometer and that is our proxy for bone mass because the only way to measure bone mass is to to actually you know Ash the bone and you can't do that in a living person so um yeah again bone has been variously measured throughout the the decades um bmd is the most common way to do it and if you look at bmd plots you'll see there's very obvious I'll do this in

[00:22:11] Reverse uh growth in in um childhood and then a flattening so pretty much a plateauing and then a gradual loss and that flattening or PL plateauing or uh timing of loss that is also uh I believe genetic and individual but that's the thing that is most amable to exercise intervention so somebody might have genes that um allows them to get a peak bone mass of a certain amount uh that is the same as their neighbor but because the rate of loss is different and their level of activity is different they may lose more quickly and then you throw in menopause uh you know average age about 52 to 54 or something uh and for women you'll see that loss rapidly accelerate uh for probably 5 to 8 years uh this is because um circulating estrogen almost vanishes from your blood and estrogen is an incredibly important hormone for bone because um I don't think I came back to talking about bone cells I should probably do that uh because of its effect on osteoclast it largely inhibits osteoclast keeps keeps a a check on them and prevents them from over absorbing so while I'm on those cells yes there are a number of different cells in bone the two primary well the main one is an Osteo site that's your standard bone cell that sits in bone tissue in its little cave and it is responsible for maintaining the tissue around it and also for sensing what's going on in the in the tissue environment we talk about that a bit more later but uh OST oo blasts are

[00:23:59] Osteo site precursors and they are the ones that when they attach to a bone surface they exude osteoid which is the new bone tissue which then becomes mineralized so they're the bone forming cells Osteo class are these big multinucleated cells that also attach to Bone surfaces and resorb bone in packets and um this is really important this is not a bad thing you know bone remot modeling is one of the most important ways that we maintain our skeleton uh get rid of micro damage and also adapt to Mechanical loading so resorption formation is happening throughout our life it is um the way that we release calcium into the blood for when we need it for all those other things we need calcium for so it's it's extremely important the trouble is uh estrogen does help to contain those osteoclasts when it disappears from the blood osteoclasts have a little bit of a party for a few years and resorb Bone like crazy and so that explains why uh in women at menopause we have the experience this uh dramatic loss of bone uh for for a period of years then it levels out again and sort of matches men but you can see why more men than women are fracturing with osteoporosis because firstly we don't gain as much

[00:25:22] Peak bone masks meaning more women fracture than men that's right y yeah um but in sort of in our 20s we don't have as much bone as men and then we lose more throughout life so by the end of life there's this greater disparity and and then add on to that women fall more than men in later life and so you've got this perfect storm of this is why more women than men are affected by osteoporosis and fracture and do we believe that women fall more because of a greater prevalence of sarcopenia it's a hard question uh

[00:25:58] I would say probably yes um I think there's some well reasonable amount of evidence to show that women are less active um throughout their life and as when they're older uh not that older men are particularly active these days either but I suppose because men genetically have more bone uh bone and muscle to begin with uh they've started from a higher place so uh yes a very frail old woman has um not just not very much muscle but not strong muscle not not very functional muscle so uh they balance the whole sort of neuromuscular package if you like has deteriorated to the extent that they if they are if their balance is perturbed they will struggle to regain their balance before they fall so again there's a lot there so we'll we'll just sort of summarize it quickly but basically oversimplifying a little bit we have Osteo blasts and osteoclasts that live in early in life the balance probably favors the osteoblast you're adding more bone than you're subtracting we get into an equilibrium where there's a remodeling that's constantly occurring um and the bone acts as in this sense as a reservoir also for something like calcium and so you're having rebuilding and remodeling you know if there's damage to a bone obviously you know you you if you get shin splints there has to be some healing that goes on all of these things take place um obviously if there's a need for calcium more of it comes out of the bone Etc um and then we get into this state of decline where maybe the osteoclast start winning and in women this is really Amplified in the 5 to eight years following menopause when the the most important hormone for bone preservation estrogen is taken away and estrogen being the thing that keeps osteoclasts in check is now gone and to your description the osteoclasts kind of have a party now now they really get to run a muuk and women experience a disproportionate loss of bone mass compared to men who are also in a state of decline because by the way men's estrogen levels are also declining because they're Tethered to their testosterone levels so as testosterone goes down so does aromatized estrogen and it goes down with it uh um and then they both sort of end up on the same parallel path again but the women are considerably lower because they've had that accelerated loss there's one thing

[00:28:38] I would just add um in I feel like I have to say this because I Drumm it into my students heads when I'm teaching bone growth is that the skeleton actually grows via cartilagenous proliferation and it's replaced by bone so the osteoblasts aren't causing the growth of bone they're just solidifying it that's right they're replacing the cartilaginous tissue with bone tissue yeah yeah got it um okay so let's talk a little bit about the preventive medicine side of this so before we even get into kind of the the work that you're mainly focusing on which is on um taking people who are at risk for osteoporosis and maybe holding them back from that or taking people who are in osteoporosis let's let's first address the question for the parents who are listening cuz um contrary to popular belief we do not have a huge teenage audience to this podcast um for reasons I don't understand I I my daughter my my daughter just she just hasn't found this podcast interesting in her little 16-year-old self um so what what what can I be doing to ensure that my 7-year-old 10-year-old and 16-year-old are set up for the best life possible when it comes to bone health uh given that I've already given them something pretty good fortunately knock on wood my wife and I both have pretty high bone density at least as measured by a dexas scan we could I'd like to talk about how valid or how we could be misled by that if if the case so so from a genetic standpoint they're not set up on the back foot but I want to make sure that we're going above and beyond what what what needs to be considered for us from a nutrition perspective from an exercise perspective from any other lifestyle perspective to allow our kids to reach their genetic potential well let's start with the lwh hanging fruit which is diet um I don't think there anybody could argue that a balanced diet is important for everything for every to be healthy you need all the nutrients that that we've known about for years and the same can be said for bone that means um particularly and there there are some minutia but uh the most important one obviously is calcium uh that the amount that you need throughout your life does vary but by the time you're a teenager you probably need about a th000 milligrams a day of calcium um and you need the vitamin D to go with that otherwise you can't absorb it from your gut so um making sure Dairy is by far the most um it has the it's most abundant source of calcium it's most bioavailable meaning it's most readily absorbed um it's packed with calcium you can get most of what you need um each day from well let's say a a regular glass of milk so 300 Ms is uh 250 Ms that has 300 milligrams of calcium so if you had three of those you'd basically be getting what you needed no not too many people drinking that amount of milk although I suppose the number of bowls of cereal my son eats could possibly be approaching that number so um but there are sources you know cheese and yogurt and and then there's the discretionary Foods if you eat a lot of ice cream and cream that sort of thing you can get it from there as well but we would say yogurt cheese and milk are the best sources but that but that but but that's that's I mean 750 mL of milk or milk equivalent is is probably less than most kids are consuming yeah I would say so particularly as uh as they move into their teenage years and probably getting more conscious about uh weight and are thinking that they might be drinking diet soda instead of a a milk drink and and it doesn't matter what the fat content of the milk is I assume well actually curiously I mean for the

[00:32:53] Vitamin D it probably does but does it matter for the calcium well lowfat milk actually does have more calcium in it just by virtue of the fact if you take the fat out you can fit volume okay got it got it it is actually um uh and plus you can buy fortified milk we have physical in Australia uh which has more calcium in it and I'm certain you guys fortify a lot of your Foods uh and I believe you do put vitamin D in your milk I think um so it's it's nice to get to get both but by far the easiest way to get vitamin D is the Sun and converting it in the skin we in particular Australia is uh you know we are white people living in a black people's country we have a very high rate of skin cancer here our sun is extremely strong so we're quite scared of the sun we cover up we slather ourselves in sunscreen hats sunglasses the whole bit and to the extent that we've actually set ourselves up to have vitamin D deficiency and particularly in

[00:33:55] Tasmania very south they you know there's a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency so the it's important to um figure out when is a safe time to be in the Sun and ensure that you get a little bit of sun because it is by far the most efficient way to get your vitamin D never go even close to getting sunburnt but you don't have to get sunburnt in

[00:34:19] Australia we should be able to get our vitamin D requirement before 10:00 a.m. and and after 2 possibly a little later if you're in a really hot area area um in in Hobart in Tasmania in the middle of winter you would need to stand shirtless for an hour in the sun to get what you needed so you know then you've got to start thinking possibly about supplementation what what level matters

[00:34:42] Belinda do you I know in kids it's I mean I don't think any of my kids have ever had a vitamin D level checked although in an adult we do this all the time um is there a level beneath which you you would say we've got to be menting you if you can't do better than this with sunlight the problem with vitamin D is that nobody can agree there are two schools of thought there are two levels that have been published and people will die in a ditch over those um if you've got PE smart people feeling that strongly about two different levels it tells me that nobody really knows what are the two levels that people are dying over uh 30 is probably one of them right seems to be one of the cut offs 30 is is the um I believe is the deficiency cut off 30 yeah nanogram per milliliter and and 50 is considered sufficient so in between that you would have um insufficiency okay um but other people say it's 75 so I I and I because this isn't really my area I don't want to go out on limb and say which is which they're easily searchable [Applause] [Music] um what there's been a lot of uh research done probably it's dropped off a little now as we've discovered that you hyperd doing with vitamin D is not safe uh and increases

[00:36:14] Falls uh the to get somebody's vitamin D up quickly you have to hypose so people have sort of moved away from vitamin D as a strategy to prevent osteoporosis it's really important that you try to encourage people to be sufficient and so possibly uh they will need a supplement of a certain dose that's going to depend on the person and all manner of other things so I don't think it's necessarily help I mean most people are going to require a supplement to be above 50 I do I mean I live in Texas and our sun is a lot like yours and I'm in the Sun every single day and I don't even put sunscreen on anything but my face so my arms and legs I'm not you know shirtless usually but my arms and legs are constantly exposed and I think if I'm not supplementing vitamin D I'm lucky to be above 40 so I I I do supplement with 5,000 IU daily and that takes me to 50 to 60 um which again suggests I'm probably okay um but but it's not uncommon here in the US to see people unsupplemented um you know easily being in the 30s that's that's not un that's not uncommon well be was there a reason that you started supplementing did you have any symptoms your bones are no none whatsoever I literally supplement for no apparent reason other than some loosely held belief that I'm going to be better off at 55 than 35 um yeah but I don't I don't it's more the precautionary principle it's more that I haven't found any compelling evidence that I'm worse off at that level and there there may be you know sort of benefits to it but but

[00:38:11] I don't you know I I don't feel immensely strongly about it but again I'm thinking about this through the lens of children where I would worry more about supplementing a kid be because a we don't it's just too much it's it's harder to measure vitamin D levels in them you don't want to go and poke them for blood all the time I mean like so so and you wouldn't want you you just you would hope you could get it all from milk dairy and sunlight

[00:38:39] I guess would be my point yeah that that would be my recommendation um you know the other thing is too vitamin D assays are notoriously dodgy so you know from one one to the next you may not get the same result so I don't know I've never had mine measured and um I I track my bones to make sure they're doing okay and uh you know that's how I choose to manage it and and I think as you say it's just going to have to be whatever your tolerance whatever your belief is that's that's pretty much um get as much education as you can and probably follow the guidelines that make the most sense to you oh boy okay so we got we've got calcium which I'm again I I think based on the based on that what you said earlier I think most people are going to struggle to get that much in without being deliberate so that's something we have to pay attention to uh sunlight um and then of course with sunlight probably comes another very important part of it which is if you're getting sunlight you're outside and if you're outside hopefully you're playing and if you're playing you're hopefully doing something good for the Bon so do you ever get asked the question um hey are there certain sports that are going to be better than other sports is running better than swimming is you know weight training okay for teenagers uh you know or we even younger like what when do we start thinking about at least doing push-ups and things like that that might also put a little bit more into it jumping Sports versus non-jumping Sports how do you think through all that stuff yeah well you've hit the nail on the head it absolutely is um extremely important the type of loading you're doing for bone so if we're talking about heart lungs mental health metabolism virtually anything is better than nothing in fact anything is better than nothing for bone too but if you really want to make a difference get most bang for your buck then you absolutely are looking for high load activities and they include things that include uh jumping and landing and uh and sort of strong muscle movements the other thing that is probably important is uh variety and uh variety within the sport and across Sports so we do tend to find that

[00:41:00] Runners for example who have only ever run are less protected from bone stress injuries in their running career than people who grew up playing basketball and uh volleyball and tennis and running um so that variety if it if we come back to Wolf's Law has probably made the bones adapt in a more robust shape to make them uh more resistant to loading in all manner of ways and also to um you know loading in One Direction so my recommendation to parents is aside from giving your kids the building blocks being enough calcium and exposure to vitamin D every day then use those building blocks by getting them outside every day I mean I know the guidelines don't necessarily say every day but every day is what you're aiming for because if you tell people every day then you may get four days a week yeah uh and of that exercise you want it to be as vigorous as possible swimming isn't going to do it walking isn't going to do it you know you need something that is just much more um Dynamic varied and will impart a high strain on bone and a strain is a measure of deformation so you're trying to make those bones

[00:42:18] Bend because it's the bending that is is coming back to my PhD and what I was trying to solve it's bending that is actually forming the stimulus to uh to stimulate bone adaptation so a couple interesting things there uh swimming and walking obviously both have enormous benefits especially swimming but again you're in a zero you're not a zero g environment but a very low G environment that it couldn't have less bone loading um the other I think very important takeaway there is um and it's funny because I remember seeing a study that looked at this and being a little surprised initially but I think based on what you're saying it makes a lot more sense the study basically showed that Runners didn't have particularly great immunity from osteopenia and osteoporosis and I remember at first thinking God how is that they they're loading so much they're you know but your point is if you're just running you're just adapting to one very simp not simple but but repeatable movement in One Direction whereas if you're playing soccer or basketball now you're not just running you do run but then you move laterally you move backwards you jump uh there's more Force because you sprint uh so so all of those things taken together make a bigger difference in creating the variety that you talked about within the sport and then across the sports if you play more than one yeah absolutely uh you know there was a study done in at

[00:43:48] Stanford in '92 well it was published in 92 by friend of mine actually who looked at the St Varsity athletes and compared them to sedentary controls of you know Stanford students who weren't who weren't doing anything and it was really interesting to see that uh if you compared swimmers cyclists Runners and gymnasts to these sedentary controls on the scale of bone mineral density swimmers were lowest uh then I believe cyclists were the same as sedentary controls because they're also in a weight supported um uh activity Runners were slightly higher and gymnast we know off the scale now this was an observational trial it's subject to all of those selection biases that that um observational trials not trial it was a study uh that are they are um subject to for example you're likely to have people who are lighter so they have lighter bones who are good at swimming because they float better so it makes them faster so there's that bias they may already have had lighter bones but on the other hand it's at that time

[00:45:05] I think they were doing about six hours of of training a day in the pool and that was actually unloading their bones so it's it's amazing to me because the the muscle loads that that are occurring during imagine swimming 50 m of butterfly you know there's some big muscle forces but it's not enough it's weightbearing loading that is important and we know this because of how much bone people lose if they go into microgravity so it was swimming sedentary Runners and gymnasts in that study uh cyclists too I believe and they're the ones who were the same as the sedentary control so you know that and and this is I don't want anybody to take home that U any of these activities are bad they're great for for virtually every other tissue uh it's just that swimming and cycling even running are not going to markedly increase your B mass and the comment about running you know when we go for a run it feels like we're pounding the pavement but actually the loads you're putting on your body are not that great in particularly

[00:46:11] Runners that we would consider to have good technique who are running quite lightly yeah their feet are actually dissipating a lot of the load right the connective tissue in the feet and the muscles within the feet are really a big part of the shock absorption there well that's how we evolved you know with these amazing archers and but also remember when you land your ankle is you know is is either flexion and extension are weird at the ankle but um and your knees will Flex when you land and your hip as well so you've got all this shock absorption the whole way up so that is dissipating the load um the same thing does happen you do dissipate loads in gymn gymnastics but when you watch those

[00:46:55] Olympic gymnasts do their tumbling runs and they land from one of those crazy tumbles boom on the floor they are loading their bones like crazy so not only are they getting these enormous forces that are stimulator to Bone but again this self- selection effect of gymnast the ones who had bones like iron to begin with probably were able to remain in the sport because they weren't getting injured so there is that observational study you know there are obviously caveats with thees but I do think it's there is there are lessons to be learned from it yeah and there's another study I saw that that expanded that um and added other sports to the mix and um the other sports I would I I remember it talked about that were also very very high were football meaning

[00:47:48] American football um Jiu-Jitsu and uh powerlifting now again my my take on that is well I mean powerlifting is really obvious right I mean you it's the definition of literally lifting the heaviest weight imaginable um football has the confounder that if you play football you're also lifting weights so it's probably just as much to do with how much weight training goes into playing American football as opposed to the actual Act of you know playing football itself I I would argue that that has benefits from a bone perspective we could certainly talk about the disadvantages it has as well and then Jiu-Jitsu is interesting um in that uh not doing it myself but two my two of my three kids do it and so you know certainly spend a lot of time watching it at tournaments but again a lot of sh a lot of force being put on

[00:48:41] Bones there is a lot of bone deformation in Jiu-Jitsu just based on how hard they're tugging and contorting and stuff like that to me the big takeaway here is not that we should look at the sports that do the most for bone density and say that's what we need to do we should ask the question what is it about that sport that's doing so much for bone density and how can we replicate that because of course you could also argue that you know most gymnasts I assume have quite a lot of problems orthopedically later in life um just based on the nature of the sport so it you know again the question is how do we reproduce it fortunately I would say that a lot of athletes today such as

[00:49:23] Runners and cyclists and swimmers are probably spending more time in the weight room today than they were in 1992 you know the the early 90s was really an era when swimming was kind of a 6 hours in the water everyday sport thing and I think today they're spending actually a little less time in the water and they're probably spending more time on dry land and my guess is if that study were repeated today I wouldn't be surprised if we found some improvements in the the ultra endurance athletes um but again the takeaway as a parent is um diversity of sport and loadbearing right yeah 100% And and I think you know I've been because my other area of research is bone stress injuries you know I do talk to coaches of swimmers uh and and that's exactly the advice we give get them out of the pool you know get them get them cross training and get them lifting weights you did ask just before um you mentioned what are the benefits or and how early should we get kids doing weight training and for years there were uh you people were very scared of that and think oh no you'll you'll stunt their growth yeah and you know there is no evidence of that and I don't know where that even came from I mean people talk about oh you you compress their growth plates why that doesn't make any sense it just takes a lot to do that uh I'm I'm not necessarily saying that you should be loading kids up with enormous weights there's no need for that but there is certainly nothing to suggest that you shouldn't do resistance training when you're a kid I I would say the only reason that you wouldn't do it is if they didn't like it because the thing you don't want to do is um discourage a child from being active throughout their life so the best thing you can possibly do is whatever that child loves to do and then if that happens to be something that doesn't include particular bone loading then just try and add that stuff in don't don't force it down their throat otherwise you'll it's very counterproductive as those of us with children know yeah I'm really I'm really glad you brought that up I've I I I was going to ask you and I I got a little distracted but um I think this is one of those myths that just drives me bananas um and we we've looked I mean we have tried and tried and tried to find the evidence that suggests that kids can't lift weights and we're we're coming up empty we're just coming up empty um and and so hopefully folks listening to this are are also realizing and I think as a parent the easiest thing you can do especially if you have some equipment at home that you can use to exercise is just have your kids come in the gym with you when you're lifting weights and and that's what we do and and never once have I said to my kids I want you to lift weights it's just hey we're going to go in the gym gym and I'm going to lift weights and you can do whatever you want and look there's not much else to do in the gym they're going to start picking stuff up they're going to start copying you so um so anyway I think I think that's it's helpful it's a great opportunity to teach him technique because that's what's going to mess people up not just kids if they're not doing it right you know you don't want a kid just going over and trying to do a deadlift and not doing it right so there's your opportunity teach them from a young age do a beautiful deadlift there's there is one of the most useful exercises they can do their entire life yeah I'm glad to hear you say that because my little boys are so competitive with doing kettle bell deadlifts now um I have to hold them back because as you know once they start to try to go really heavy their technique actually kind of breaks down a little bit so um I want to talk about another kind of sensitive area with kids that I'm sure you get asked about a lot which is invariably some kids will have asthma or they'll have other conditions that require the use of corticosteroids either inhaled or systemic and I know that we we see this in our practice when when adults come in and we're surprised to see in an otherwise healthy person astonishingly low bone density and of course through our history we realize oh you know you were on you know you took prazone for this many years of your life so um I know that nobody out there no physician out there no parent out there is it takes it lightly but but is there any guidance you can provide as far as the minimum effective dose or maybe is there some comfort you can provide to a parent that says hey you know an inhaler for asthma used at this frequency is not going to impact the long-term bone health of a child there's no evidence because we haven't got longterm data as far as I'm aware and again not not really my area um all I can say is corticosteroid should be minimized as much as possible throughout the whole life um if a if anybody child or adult is able to uh manage their asthma just with ventalin which doesn't seem to have any negative effect on on bone uh that is what I would be recommending try to stay off steroid inhalers if you possibly can if you're on high doses try to try to titrate them down um see if you can manage in other ways uh I mean I I don't want to terrify people but really there's it is abundantly clear that corticosteroids are the enemy of bone and uh the longer you're on them the more damage they do um be on them if you know many people they're life saving for some people so so you have to go on them and then just get off them as quickly as you can once once your respiratory condition has calmed down um and of course if uh if you are in a situation where you must take them and at high doses then you absolutely would probably need to absolutely probably you would really need to consider um some bone medication to counteract that that's what I would be recommending for adults yeah and maybe the the lesson here for for parents again is if your child requires being on corticosteroids well presumably they really require them I don't think any doctor takes that decision lightly but it might just mean that's all the more reason to double down on the other things we talked about right which is if if your child is on corticosteroids for a medical need then let's make sure that that's the kid that's getting 750 ml or 24 ounces of milk a day and they're out in the Sun every day and they're lifting weights and they're doing diverse Sports because again like let's take everything else and stack it in their favor so that when they come to see their doctor in their 40s the doctor will on the one hand realize oh you were on steroids as a kid but hey lo and behold your bone density is actually okay you haven't been as impacted by it as possible are are children more susceptible to corticosteroids because they're in a developmental phase or are adults equally susceptible in terms of in other words does it affect kids more because it's affecting them on the the way up or does it affect adults equally because it has just as much of a Down impact on them in the maintenance phase yeah I that that would be very much stepping out of my Lane to answer that one I don't know the answer to it um all I know is they're bad at any age so I think we've got a pretty good primer on what what parents need to be thinking about with with kids so now let's turn it back over to the adults so um we're we're talking about men and women in their 30s and 40s um so for most women they're still on the on the on the positive side of of estrogen balance um beyond what we just said for kids is there anything you would add to that as importance important tools as a person enters middle life it's actually exactly the same you've just you've got to maintain uh your diet and levels of exercise um because your bones need that those two uh elements to ma to maintain and so in the old days we we I'm sure you can picture in your head the uh trajectory of bone growth plateau and loss uh and the Mantra was this is inevitable this is what you know that's what bone aging looks like um for years

[00:58:21] I've been saying that's what sedentary Behavior looks like like and that's what the sedentary effect on a skeleton is I believe that if you maintain your your levels or increased your levels uh from of physical activity friendly bone loading from the time you were 20 until the time you died I would be willing to bet that you could go a long way towards maintaining that plateau and the master athlet data seems to support that so if you look at those data you see that bmd is maintained in in Master's athletes as long as they're maintaining their activity there may be a slight loss yes but that's probably because the loads that they're able to produce in their their physical performance also um reduce but it this is a this is an atrophy effect this is not a genetically programmed aging effect and I know that there are many people around the world who would argue with me because I I don't have much data aside from um that sort of the the Master's athletes long-term data but you know it's it's almost impossible to collect those data because that those are lifelong studies and I would I would be dead before the study would be finished if I started it now so well this is this is a very provocative idea but I'll I'll I'll give you an example of where I think there there are two arguments I would offer that suggest you you could be right the the first is um when you look at spontaneous activity and movement of people as they age you see a very similar um pattern which is a relative

[01:00:12] Plateau preservation of not just activity but lean mass um followed by a deterioration suggesting that as lean mass goes down movement goes down activity goes down and that then it feeds back on itself it becomes a vicious cycle and Away you go so again as you said it could be that the what we see as a quote unquote physiologic decline of bone loss is not that it's rather a proxy for muscle loss and reduced activity the second point I would argue again in favor of this hypothesis is something that um that

[01:00:53] Luke vanloon uh I don't know if you know Luke but he's a protein uh scientist and I had him on the podcast recently and he he he shared something that I thought was fascinating which is we I've always taken it as a given that anabolic resistance occurs due to aging because of course we see it clearly with aging but he he discussed some exercises uh pardon me some studies that demonstrated that anabolic resistance was most exacerbated by inactivity and this was done on the cast study so you take a given individual you cast one leg not the other leg you know before you do that you run the amino acid Isotopes through them you do this exercise for two weeks you take the cast off so you have an atrophied leg and a normal leg you do the same amino acid uh Isotopes and lo and behold there's like 40% or 50% anabolic resistance on the leg that was in the cast this is not because they got older in two weeks it's because they were inactive and and they lost muscle activity well if that's true it really suggests that we shouldn't accept anabolic resistance as an inevitability of aging and and I'm I'm quite inclined to to think your hypothesis could be correct here which is if you just don't stop the movement if you just don't stop the exercise this decline of of bmd might be far better than what the

[01:02:15] Actuarial data predict based on sedentary Behavior I 100% agree with you sounds like a village people's song Don't Stop The the movement and uh you know you only have to look at those beautiful studies that have shown MRIs of um Master's athletes Cals compared with an age matched person who's not active you also compared with a young um person's calf

[01:02:46] The Young and the Masters look identical you know the muscle volume and quality there's no fatty infiltration and the sub fat is is virtually non-existent whereas you look at somebody same age as the Master's athlete who's not active and you've got this shrunken down little sarcopenic muscle belly that fatty infiltration and a Big W of subq fat obviously that's you know you could you could select anybody from the population and and you could make the data look like what it what you want it to by comparison of those age groups but uh Al those the same age but the the appearance of that Master's athlete muscle essentially you know it confirms what you and I are both saying this is a this is a sedentary um problem this is not an age problem and and of course this comes back to the problem with the a lot of people will say well who cares

[01:03:38] I know that um 60% of the population will not do enough physical activity to maintain that so we need to invent um drugs that do the same thing as far as I can tell I I never say never but I think we will struggle to ever find a drug that will be able to replicate uh the action of exercise physical loading on muscle and bone because you can't replicate the stimulus and you know any drug that is found to work probably will still need exercise for it to manifest its benefits yeah and there's another kind of deeper issue there because as you know and maybe the listeners as well um there is an enormous interest from a pharmac itical standpoint in antiarc penic drugs um you know as it stands today obviously we have anabolic steroids and they're very efficacious but they require the training stimulus as you pointed out you know you can give a person all of the testosterone in the world but if they don't do if they don't train they have zero benefit or virtually zero benefit you know slight benefit um and of course the Holy Grail is can we give you know agents that can cause muscle growth even absent the the uh the the um the profound training stimulus that that is needed in other regards and I always say well the answer is maybe but will it be functional muscle um and and to that extent will it be functional bone so even if you know a drug like beima or an igf1 uh Agonist or um some of these other drugs or molecules that are being touted potentially increase muscle size it's not clear that they're going to increase strength function um and and and bony composition so um yeah I guess it's just it's just the nature I think of our species we really love shortcuts we do take if we can take a pill why would you expend any effort and that's unfortunately the gene which is going to be our undoing in terms of of healthy aging um right that that actually got us very far when resources were scarce that was a very very helpful uh Gene in an abundant in a resource uh scarce environment um let's let's talk a little bit now about this menopausal transition um again it's it's it's right up there with death and taxes in terms of inevitability um it's an area that I have become intensely interested in um because I view it is you know one of the great tragedies of the past 25 years is you know this very popular study done the

[01:06:33] Women's Health Initiative which was done uh published in the early part of the uh of the century and and really came to in my view a very erroneous conclusion which basically scared an entire generation of Physicians and women away from HRT um and and as a result of that not only has there been an unnecessary abundance of symptoms associated with menopause but I but I think the real hidden tragedy has been the larger epidemic of of osteopenia and osteoporosis in a in a group of women who may have otherwise received estrogen as they as they went through menopause um so I know that your area of interest is not or area of expertise is not you know in the hormone side as abundantly as it is on the training side but is there is there anything on the the hormone side that that you want to talk about beyond what we've already discussed which is the important physiology the important role estrogen plays specifically in managing the role of osteoclasts in bone remodeling and and and you know I assume that most of the women and men presumably the women of course for the purpose of this discussion that are coming into this

[01:07:46] Clinic are they mostly postmenopausal yeah the majority would be post but we got you know we have thousands of people on the books uh and so that that number you know is of people who are not postmenopausal is is still substantial um so I think the the years uh that we've been open and we've been open almost exactly nine years now um the and awareness has grown in the in the community about us uh people who are not postmenopausal but are aware that either they have low bone mass already or that Mom or Dad or or granny or grandpa had low bone mass they want to prevent it so it it's one of the happiest things that has happened that people are realizing that Prem manopause is the time to start uh taking care of this issue so we do have a proportion but of course most people don't have any idea what their bone health is like until they either have a first fracture or they go through menopause and they have a savvy enough GP who says we need to get your Baseline dexa let's get you started and all of a sudden yikes I have either osteopenia or osteoporosis away you go to the boing clinic and and you you said something very important there which you and I take for granted it's I think it's very important to reiterate for the for the listeners for the female listeners in particular um which is you don't want to wait until you're into menopause to replace estrogen you have to do it during the pre and Par menopausal stage to get the maximum effect and again this is something that

[01:09:32] I think um not enough women are being educated on and as such even if they know oh yeah I've kind of heard that estrogen matters and this might be a reason for me to consider HRT as part of my decision Matrix you know they might think well let me go through this two miserable years of per menopause wait till I'm completely amenic my EST dial levels are unmeasurable and my FSH is through the roof and now we should start doing it no it turns out that there are data that suggest that they've actually lost quite a bit of bone up until that point um which again to me is it's it's so preventable um so I just I hope that women listening to this are are are sitting with doctors who who can can help them through that transition I'm sure many people listening to us have had a dexa scan so when you get a dexa scan and um sometimes it so let's put aside the body composition part of it where you see body fat and lean mass um sometimes when you get a dexa scan it shows you total bone density and it says your total bone density zcore is this and your tcore is that but it doesn't give any segmental information it doesn't tell you about the lumbar spine or the hips or the femurs or anything like that uh and if you look closely it might even give you a number in grams per centimeter squared uh as an actual number do you want to just help people make sense of what all those numbers mean uh why for example is it grams per centimeter squared not grams per centimeter cubed as a density um and um maybe explain to people the difference between their zc scores and their T scores and if anything can be uh understood from the total body zcore tcore or if we must be looking at segmental I know there's a lot in there but have at it okay so uh dual energy x-ray absorb deometry is a lowd dose radiation tool much lower dose than a than a x-ray of your chest uh where the the name describes what it's doing it's sort of sending two two energies through the body in in a way to determine and the density of the tissue it's going through now it is a Mis Noma it is an aerial density you know which is a contradiction because it is a planer uh view the X-ray source is underneath the bed you lie on the bed and the detector is in the arm above and it is it's a projected image of this sort of two-dimensional density they call it aerial bone mineral density um because the the without going into too much detail and I may screw it up not being a medical physicist uh the the method of measuring is looking at the the what is detected according to the density of the material so it's not volumetric at all if you want a volumetric density you have to look at um a three-dimensional um method of measuring uh so you can also get bone mineral content and area from the same scan and they're derived from this Den measure uh so they talk about it in grams per centim squ because it's an aerial measure so the answer to the question uh about total bmd binal density that is the the amount of bone that you're observing from a whole body scan and normally if your doctor wants to know if you have osteopenia or osteoporosis they will send you to the

[01:13:23] Radiology clinic and they will do a standard spine and hip scan they're the normal ones from which you would diagnose um those conditions not a whole body scan the only reason you would do a whole body scan is if like us we want to look at body composition because we're interested in lean mass I wouldn't use the value the bmd value that I get from the total scan as a marker or is any index for osteopenia osteoporosis because the who definition was actually based at the hip um in fact it was based on femoral neck we've moved away from looking at femoral neck as the standard and we look at total hip now because there there can be quite a bit of variation of femoral neck um because of the way that you analyze it so osteoporosis should be really diagnosed from hip uh bmd according to the definition of the World Health

[01:14:22] Organization was that a t-core of - 2.5 is definitive of osteoporosis a tcore between 1 and minus minus1 and -2.5 is osteopenia or low bone mass now they are that's essentially tcore is a standard deviation so what is that compared to your value is compared to a reference database and the t score is actually comparing your score to what they call a young normal uh it depends on the site but um and that does vary but let's just say it is roughly a 20y old between 20 and 30 uh of the same race and sex so a 52y old woman is going uh let's say 52y old white woman is her value her bmd value is going to be compared to the average

[01:15:25] MD value of a white woman age 20 that's the t score the Zed score is comparing your value to someone the same age and sex so compared to the average bmd of a 52y old white woman uh so that is if you're looking at the plot and you have the average score goes up like talking about in um uh if it doesn't go up because we start at age 20 it's pretty much plateauing and then it begins to go down so your score will be plotted on there age 52 if you went straight up to the average value that is what your uh bmd Zed score is being compared to so it's a standard deviation from there the tcore is being compared to right at the start of that plot to the and this is the reason why they give us these two values is because it's thought that at any stage of your life if you are two and a half standard deviations away from uh the amount of bone that you probably started with then you are at increased risk of fracture and obviously the problem with that is the fact that you could have started higher or lower than that average and most of us did very few of us are actually average um but the Zed score gives us information about where you lie in relation to your peers how how normal that is so the The Zed score is normally not as scary as a t-core uh because you will have lost some bone yeah the way I try to help my patients understand it is that um you know as you said like I always give them an example right like if your if your if your zcore is zero you're at the 50th percentile of the population um if your zcore is one you're a full standard deviation above the mean so what's that you're in the 85th percentile if I'm doing the math correctly um so and and obviously as you said the t- score is always going to be lower because we're comparing you to a perfect standard we're comparing you to that super healthy you know 20 to 30 year old so what we say to patients is look we want your t-core to like if you show up with a decent tcore your tcore is zero and your zore score is plus you know8 we say the win is keeping that t-core where it is and letting and watching the zcore go up because over time we want you being better and better and better than your AG matched peers because they're going down and we're going to hold you plateau and that means we can't improve you relative to the t-core although I'd love to hear in your experience if you what you're finding there but we can improve relative to your peers yeah it's a good example and and yes you're right we can impr improve that t school well let's let's get right to it because this is this is you know going back to the outside of this discussion Belinda I I learned about you I don't I don't even know how I think I was like literally just watching stuff on YouTube and somehow saw a clip it's probably many years old from local news in Australia highlighting you talking about the lift more study and I there's just some like if you look at the things that I can get sucked into on YouTube uh it's car videos uh F1 videos like there's there's like there's this world that just sucks me in but

[01:19:09] I'll tell you another one of the things that sucks me in videos of elderly people lifting weights I can go down that rabbit hole like it's my I mean it's ridiculous you show me a 90y old old woman deadlifting and like that I could watch that for days so that it must be that the algorithm knows that and it was it served you up to me so um so let's let's talk about the lift more study so I suppose I ran about 200 uh 13 I just I got to a point in my research career where I I looked around and thought okay the the guidelines for

[01:19:54] Osteo the exercise guidelines for osteoporosis are get your kids jumping and running and and playing as much sport as possible keep doing that for as long as you can but then when you get osteoporosis stop doing all that and just prevent Falls so you don't break and I just so are we done is this the best we can do this this you know this is lame I all my animal research experience had told me that even with very low bone Mass animals if you load them they they can grow bone the only reason we hadn't been doing that in research is because we were terrified of hurting someone and so it seemed to me like we hadn't really tried and at the risk of hurting somebody we decided to do it so we had three physiotherapists on that trial including the PHD student who who ran at Steve Watson uh we decided to do a brief because bone doesn't need a lot of loading you don't need to run a mar Marathon you just need to do one Sprint to get those bone cells stimulated so we had twice a week 30 minutes four exercises and we wanted them lifting heavy so it's 85% 1rm uh we used compound movements because we wanted them you know this needed to be an efficient um sort of uh project we wanted to involve as much muscle as possible it needed to be weightbearing and we wanted something that would transfer to really useful daily activities so clearly a squat and a deadlift was going to be fundamental these are fabulous compound movements that they tick all those boxes and these are not on machines this is with free weights because you want to engage as much um of those other systems and capacities as possible we're trying to improve balance because we're trying to stop people falling so away we went it needed to be ideally we wanted it to be 12 months because you do need a fair amount of time to be able to detect change on dexa because dexa ionizing radiation picks up mineral so you can't just measure new bone which would be the osteoid unmineralized you need a full um period of time to allow for a full remodeling cycle and mineralized Bone because it was a PhD project we couldn't afford a full year for each uh every person so we just made it an 8-month intervention which I was confident would be enough to detect a change we did really comprehensive uh bone and functional measures at Baseline we recruited about a 100 people randomly allocated them to this high-intensity resistance and impact training and a because in research you you have to exercise research is really hard to Blind to your participants and and blinding is so important in clinical trials so had to not tell our participants which was the intervention that we thought was going to be effective we just said if you got randomized to this low intensity home program we were trying to see whether that worked too of course we knew that that was not going to work because we've got years of experience to know that that is not going to improve bone but we gave them things like walking stretching some body weight lunges and toe raisers and things that would potentially improve their balance so we weren't complet completely ripping them off so then we had eight months of this intervention it was super sorry once again Belinda you said the the the treatment group was 20 minutes three times a week no 30 minutes two times a week got it yeah uh maximum group size was eight and we recruited postmenopausal women so we were looking for people we advertised for over 60 but I think we did recruit one person who was 58 because she had been through menopause when she was young um and they just needed to be well clear of menopause we didn't want to be fighting that withdrawal of estrogen phase uh and they needed to have low bone mass so they needed to be at least a t-core of minus one uh at either the the spine or the hip so away we went and I have to say we were looking through our fingers for a little bit and we were so incredibly conservative to begin with and just being very careful that we weren't hurting anybody it became abundantly clear very quickly that we weren't hurting anybody in fact we were making people feel a lot better just let me just ask you about that because again I um the video which we'll link to in the show notes was even though it was just a local news segment was just really inspiring um I think there were women there that were at some point basically able to pick up their body weight I mean is that am I remembering that correctly like literally these women were deadlifting their body weight um how did you even train them to do this so you these these these these women show up to this study and you know they're probably told it's an exercise study so they think great I'll be doing you know pool jogging or something and then you drag them into a wait room with Olympic bars um how did how did you even go about getting them to do this safely how did you how much how much resistance was there on their part to to the fear of weightlifting I assume prior weightlifting experience was not an inclusion criteria no they could have had it but they couldn't have been doing anything in the past 12 months because you know bone is a lose it or use it use it or lose it tissue so um you know they they needed to not be already doing this um we described it as you know we told them what the basic exercises were so these had to be people who were willing to do this um we never throw somebody straight into lifting something extremely heavy and certainly nobody would have expected that we're we would end up with people lifting their body weight certainly least all us um we just did it very systematically we you know you start with a broomstick and you make sure that people's technique is good and I have to tell you we had people with es so they had existing kyphosis and you know what a kyotic curvature looks like in a deadlift position this is not a pretty thing but as long as they had an extensive moment uh it was okay we don't want people flexing and lifting weight because then we're putting them at risk of fracture but it's all in the coaching and this is the reason why it's so important that the person who is coaching somebody with osteoporosis knows what they're doing they don't just they can't just be strength and conditioning coach although that really helps they have to have an understanding of they have to have some clinical training so because people come to you in a clinic with not just osteoporosis but you know pelvic floor dysfunction frozen shoulder spond ois vertigo just every neoa you've got to be able to manage that and many of those conditions were actually screened out of the limore study because it was the first time we were doing it we did want to have to manage all of that but I just put it out there because it's something I I I want to remember to talk about um so it was all about just systematically training them in the technique and uh and then gradually increasing the load and a lot of people think of older people and particularly older women and particularly postmenopausal women who you know the assumption is they go completely loopy through menopause which is not true um they think about old people as completely incapable incapable of doing stuff and incapable of learning but old people are you and me who just kept living longer it's we you know we have the capacity to learn and and older people are perfectly capable of learning how to do a deadlift in a squat you know it might be pretty ugly to start with but they get better and as they get stronger they get even better so I I just I just love it it so much I cannot you know for for people listening and not watching right now just the the grin on my face listening to you talk about this it just warms my my heart um and and again it's um it's I I I just agree with all of that I think that um one of the saddest sort of I think misconceptions people have is that once they get to a certain age it's too late um and they sort of accept their fate and oh I have this kyotic spine and oh my bones are too brittle and I guess I'm just going to spend the next decade of my life doing nothing um and and studies like this demonstrate that that's that's not the case and so um I'm looking for some of the other kind of soft stuff as you think about the the evolution of this study I mean what else did you notice in the subjects what did they tell you what was there how did this translate into the rest of their lives because obviously you as an investigator are are are looking for something very specific right you want to probably understand how much muscle mass they put on what their bone density did how much their t- scores changed but were there other things that you learned about these these women as the study went on that that spoke to their quality of life oh yeah undoubtedly and and for them that was the most important thing and that's what makes that is what made me want to open the clinic this is a quality of life issue this is it turns out this is not a bone a bone issue I'm a bone head I care about what their bmd scores did but the reality is comments like oh my God belinder I can see my shoulders in the mirror again you know because their posture changed the fact that we had you know when you do a clinical trial you measure height and weight as the standard Baseline how to describe your population who knew that we would actually be cting height as an outcome because the control group shrank whereas the uh the intervention group grew a little of course they didn't grow but their posture improved to the extent that they were taller at the end of the the study and the difference between groups was significant it was only half a centimeter but hey wouldn't you prefer eight months I mean yeah yeah and so those if you like soft outcomes you know people saying my husband is hiking the

[01:30:50] Cota Trail and and I just thought I was going to be eading I can go with him now I've got this this Incredible strength I've basically got my life back I can I can get into the garden and I can I can push the wheelbarrow full of potting mix around now and I I don't feel like I'm going to break and you know I can lift my grandchild again um I can get my own shopping out of the car yeah but it's it's all about independence um yeah quality of life we measure quality of life as well and and uh at the at the clinic it's it's pretty obvious that that is something that is improving so what did you find after eight months with respect to to muscle mass bone density and the other sort of clinical metrics yeah so um we ended up with a net benefit of a bit over 4% at the spine that that equated to about 3%

[01:31:51] Improvement at the spine in bmd and about one and a half or one and a bit loss in controls that I would say that this program definitely has the biggest effect of the spine which is you know that is a good thing because one of the places that that fractures most frequently at the hip it was a real head scratcher when we when I first looked at the results we had something like a 6 uh perc Improvement at the femoral neck and

[01:32:21] I'm thinking these women deadlift and squatting 70 kilos how can that be we ended up with a significant difference because the controls lost 2 and a half% so there you know there was a net benefit but I couldn't figure it out luckily I have some 3D hip software which allows me to reanalyze my 2D bmd data from dexa and look at the GE changes in

[01:32:49] Geometry from that you could see uh things like um cross-sectional area of the femoral neck cortical thickness and so on when you look at cortical thickness of the total hip uh sorry total femoral neck there was a 133% net benefit uh in the intervention group and if you looked specifically at the lateral femoral neck cortex there was a 27% Improvement so it turns out that it it if you adjust at bmd from dexa it would look like you know this kind of lifting only has a maintenance effect at the hip but actually what's happening is it's changing the geometry it's making it stronger by making the cortex that cortical bone thicker and more resistant to uh to bending so that was a you know another of those fantastic moments where

[01:33:48] I had only just got this uh software and and it was just in time to show this really novel outcome uh I think that's such an important Point by the way and and given that most of us clinicians don't have access to that um can we in your opinion rely on the stabilization of the zcore uh or the Improvement of the zcore the stabilization of the tcore is a win if we're in that situation so we have that patient who comes in at a minus two you get them on a strength training program they're putting on muscle mass the the zcore gets better but the tcore does not you still say look you're probably winning even though you don't have the the radiographic tool to document the cortical bone thickening yeah if you can maintain bone mass at the hip uh bone mineral density yes that is absolutely a win and you know don't get me wrong there were some people who probably the the largest game we had at the hip in the lift Moore study was about 6% so there were some people who improved bmd but um yeah on average it's it's something that you don't always see and the important thing I think for people to understand here is even if going on this type of a training program at best maintained you let's assume even the cortical thickening was maintained there's two important points to consider the controls are having the floor dropped from underneath them so that gap between what you would be doing and what you're doing is widening even if you're not getting better so the fact that you're even getting better slightly is mind-boggling but even if you don't the the gap between where you are and where you would be is enormous the second point is your fall risk is going down dramatically because you're putting on muscle mass and to the very important point you made you're using these free weights and you're getting you're improving your balance so you have more muscle more balance more motor control your the the likelihood of falling to get in the position that you're going to break a bone is going down so much so when you add to the fact that oh and by the way cortical bone is increasing by 13% like this is just a win-win winwin win across the board an know show me a bone drug that does that so it's a uh if you look at our functional outcomes we had back extensive strength leg extensive strength and then we had tandem walk timed up and go sit to stand vertical jump and we also um measured kyphosis all of those things improved but especially uh lower extremity strength and back extensive strength now people think oh well back extensive strength yes it's just making them stand up straighter it's it's not a there's no just about it if somebody has kyphosis and their posture is such that their vision is angled downwards they've lost that peripheral vision for say when they're walking to their car at the shopping center which is not the their comfortable environment um perhaps a little kid runs out in front of them and they haven't seen them coming and that's when a fall can happen on a hard Supermarket floor um you know walking outside their own home and the neighbors dog runs out you know they don't see it coming they get a fright and they'll fall so posture is actually really really really important to fall risk and risk of of fracture because we know pretty much half the time you fall you're going to fracture I would add something even more to that which is um you know we we we we have um a couple of folks in our practice who are really um

[01:37:40] Forward Thinking in their understanding of the role of vision in brain health and and we know this is true with auditory stimuli as well right so we we know that you know hearing loss is a risk for dementia because it's reducing ing sensory input to the brain and um you know we would argue that you see the same thing with the reduction of visual input so a reduction of visual input is a reduction of cortical stimulation cortical meaning brain cortical um and that's also increasing problems so in addition to everything you said which is this increased risk of falling as vision is getting narrower uh you're also reducing kind of brain input and and I think you run the risk of also exacerbated or accelerated uh degeneration of the brain so yeah I I I

[01:38:30] I agree with you completely it's not that you just reverse kyphosis that's a really big deal to get somebody looking up and forward um yeah it's just I mean the other things that I'm sure you saw were Improvement in grip strength so there's another benefit because you can't deadlift without grip strength so if if a woman's picking 70 kilos off the ground think of how strong her hands are and think of the implication of that on mitigating fall risk you think about that person walking down a flight of stairs now imagine the grip they have on the handrail as they confidently walk down the steps and you you know you think of the devastating injuries that that people can have of any age but certainly older people um when they can't hold on to a handrail and then they don't have the leg strength to stop themselves going downstairs I mean again

[01:39:20] I just to reiterate this point that we can't make enough which is yes there are some really interesting and exciting drugs on the horizon for the management of this yes pharmacology and endocrinology play a very important role in managing these things I would argue estrogen more than any other drug out there but none of these things compare or should ever be thought of as a substitute for what you're describing no that's right um you know I I sort of briefly mentioned the tandem walk and sit to stand and timed up and go and B could jump and all of those things are risk factors or predictive of your risk of falling so yeah we do know that improving those things reduce your risk of falling um you're you're quite right about group strength I I do as much of this lifting as I can but I'm frequently you know I've just been to Europe for a month I've been to the US for a month and and my lifting Falls away so I come back to the to the gym and go to lift again and whereas my muscles my my major lifting muscles may be okay but I end up on my last set I am just holding on to that bath my fingertips because my grip strength goes so it is absolutely part and parcel this is why these Olympic lifts are so incredibly helpful because they are compound movements using virtually every muscle in your body including if you're frowning while you're doing it so

[01:40:48] Belinda there's there's no chance that anybody listening to us at this point would call into question value of of of this type of intervention so now the question is for virtually everybody listening to us they don't have access to you and they don't have access to your clinic um so what what would what would be the advice for the men and women who are coming coming to this discussion or who want to send this you know people listening to this who want to send it to their parents or or or loved ones who who really are growing up and are in the same state that the women were in at the beginning of your study how can we take that person and provide them with the safest environment to go forth and

[01:41:36] Conquer because again if you're saying all you got to do is 30 minutes twice a week of this very very specific type of lifting protocol which is again very straightforward um in in concept uh obviously in technique it requires execution how can they go about doing that who who would you recommend they see what type of individual to coach them so um there's there's levels uh to that answer and without being a you know turning this into an advertisement for for oniro which is what the program is called that we deliver through the through the uh the bone clinic um you know this is we because we get that question all the time the minute open the bone clinic everybody wanted the program and the problem is I didn't want to initiate an avalanche of fractures for people doing the program and hurting themselves so we decided to license it and provide that program to physiotherapists what you got guys call physical therapists and accredited exercise physiologist all their equivalent and we have licensed there's probably about 60 in Australia at the moment and growing number overseas now it's just starting to take on in the US but it's you know I'm I'm an academic so I'm not a salesperson I don't sell this people come to me and

[01:43:03] I'll and I'll you know that's how they get it um the be very best way that this the training for that is a very comprehensive six hours online you must have these qualifications to do it and then you're ready to deliver it to your patients in your clinic U as long as you have the gear and and they always got access to me and a lot of supportive information to do that safely the reason

[01:43:28] I want physios and EPS to deliver it is because they have that background information that I was telling you about that clinical training that allows them to look after the millions of different co-morbidities that are going to come into their clinic so tell us again Belinda just to make sure everyone's hearing this and we'll link to it in the show notes but the what's the name of the program where can somebody go as a as a an exercise physiologist or a physio to become accredited in this program yes so that's a it's a Ono is the name of the of the program and they just need to Google Ono Ono Academy o n r o that's right yeah um and the yeah I can give you the Ono Academy um okay we'll link to it yep so so so it's a this is not something that the patients go to this is something that the trainers go to to become accredited so if if a person is listening to this and they want to be trained can they go to that site and find out where the accredited people are yeah we go to the bone clinic site and we host a map and if you zoom in on your area on that map you will see a little little red tag okay if you click on the tag the contact details of that oniro provider will pop up now as I say at least in the US not a huge number of them at the moment but I the demand is so incredibly high in the

[01:44:56] US really um the best thing that you could do if you were in that situation and you wanted to go to an onero provider is go to your local um PT or um or kinesiologist exercise physiologist some equivalent and say okay you need this program here's the website contact Belinda and I can get them licensed and they can away they go it's for me it's research they there is a a way for them to contribute to our research program I give them access to our database I'm really interested in making sure that this works not just in our hands and so that's part of my research but for them of course it's a revenue stream so it is a win-win for them for the patients who cannot convince anybody to do onero then the the next best thing would still be to contact the bone clinic we can do a Telly health appointment with them and give them our very best advice for a program that they can do either at home or at a gym if they're not if they don't want to do that then the next best thing they can do is just go to the gym and get some gym program just anything is better than nothing and start lifting weights and try to get some supervision because if you've got a t-core of minus 4 I'm not comfortable with you training by yourself so even if you're not doing Ono get somebody to look after you um so those are the sort of three levels if you can find an Ono provider do supervis onur if you can't call uh email the bone clinic and we'll we'll do a Telly Health appointment and get you a program that you can do uh which would be the very best that we can come up with that you could do unsupervised and then the next level down just get yourself to the gym with someone supervising you and do some weights of some kind I guess I'm going to add a fourth one which is I've been to the Gold Coast many times it's absolutely spectacular I think a trip to

[01:47:01] Australia is never a bad thing maybe maybe scrap the tele medicine visit and just take a two- week vacation to the Gold Coast and uh get some time at the clinic maybe we'd love to see you actually the Clinic's in Brisbane I live on the Gold Coast because that's where G University is but the CL just well Well brisbane's gorgeous as well yeah um

[01:47:22] Belinda this has this has been excellent I'm I'm I'm just so excited to make sure that everybody out there who's listening to us has access to this type of information um I think this is you know just a a remarkable um demonstration of the power of exercise and you know people hear me say this all the time and

[01:47:40] I'm sure they're sick of hearing me say it it is the most potent drug available I you know I am a very pro- Pharma guy you know I'm I'm but but there's just no denying the evidence there is nothing that a pill can do to touch the benefits of exercise um so you know this is about as pointed as an example as you will see and I I love hearing about um how in such a relatively short period of time these these women had such a dramatic

[01:48:13] Improvement in their quality of life uh it's such an exciting story and you you know it's it's really had a greater impact on their quality of life than I I can think of any other intervention um that any any healthc care provider um could could demonstrate so anyway thank you for your work and thank you for like

[01:48:29] I said getting up early this morning to uh to share it with us it's my pleasure um it's lovely to meet a kindred spirit thanks [Music]
