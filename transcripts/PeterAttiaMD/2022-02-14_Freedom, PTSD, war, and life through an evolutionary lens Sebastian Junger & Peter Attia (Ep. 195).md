Sebastian Junger is an award-winning journalist, documentary filmmaker, and New York Times best-selling author. In this wide-ranging discussion, Sebastian shares stories from his time as a war reporter and how it shaped his understanding of the psychological effects of combat, including the sacred bond of soldiers, the forces that unify a tribe, and the psychological mechanisms that protect humans from painful experiences. He draws upon his personal struggle with PTSD as he discusses trauma as an all-too-common consequence of war and the importance of community in the healing process. He explains his interest in viewing human behavior through an evolutionary lens, including how it influences his parenting style, and he voices concerns over society’s continuous shift away from our evolutionary roots. Sebastian also tells the story of his near-death experience and his new perspective on the possibility of an afterlife.  Additionally, Sebastian shares his thoughts on the mental health implications of current events, such as the pandemic and the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and contemplates what it really means to be “free” in modern society.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] sebastian i have been looking forward to sitting down with you for god it's been 18 months it was pre-covered i know when we first talked about sitting down and then for obvious reasons things got postponed but uh nevertheless here we are it's thrilling to talk to you um we have a lot to talk about in our interview i mean when i interviewed you it was really fascinating uh i mean i loved our conversation well there are a lot of things i'm looking forward to here but perhaps the most trivial of them is getting to listen to you speak i'm sure you've been told this before but you may have the single greatest voice ever so um just the fact that i'm going to get to sit here and listen to you talk is fantastic thank you where did you grow up sebastian i grew up uh outside of boston in a little town called called belmont massachusetts okay um i want to understand a little bit better about well let's start with your dad you you you know your dad's a veteran correct no he's not a veteran i mean he was a refugee from two wars oh okay yeah he grew up he he grew up in europe his dad was a journalist in europe um european born as was my dad and they lived in spain uh and then they left when the fascists came in in 1936 under franco they fled his father was my dad's dad was jewish and they fled to france and then when the nazis came in a few years later they fled to the united states and my my dad you know made his life life here met my mom and uh tried to join the u.s military um and couldn't because he had asthma uh but he was enormously so he served the country in other ways he was a physicist and he contributed to a lot of important projects that some of which involved the us military the us government but um he was enormously grateful to this country for our sacrifice in world war ii and you know it's interesting that his um implacable pacifism uh was also mixed with an understanding that sometimes war sometimes force is necessary to protect humanity from um from fascism and other evils so he had a very complex sort of understanding of our our duties as as citizens and our place in the world as america how did he communicate that to you and how old were you in some of those lessons started to mean something more than just kind of the words that were spoken and did he communicate through direct words or was it more you know indirect means well i mean from yeah when we were growing up the world word fascist was like a dirty word i mean i you know i grew up knowing that that was the sort of ultimate evil and america stood diametrically opposed to fascism that we were the opposite of fascism we were the ultimate anti-fascist state and uh and you know i grew up during vietnam and i grew up in a very liberal environment and so every adult i knew everyone i knew was sort of anti-vietnam anti-war and by extension and not fairly but by extensions or anti-us military i mean that's just the environment i grew up in right so um i was very surprised and learned a lot when i said to my dad you know back then i was born in 1962 so in 1980 i turned 18 and i got a card in the mail from the us government saying you're an 18 year old 18 year old male we need to know where you live physically what your address is in case we need to call you into combat right and i said to my father who i knew was a pacifist i was like what the hell is this like the draft is over what do you mean my my government needs to know where i am uh and not my doesn't need to know where my sister is but where i am in case they need me to fight one of their wars right and uh i was like i'm not signing this and uh i expected my father to wholly approve the message right and uh you know my message that i wasn't gonna sign this and uh he said no no you're definitely signing it he's like you you know you don't know uh what the next war is gonna be it may be a righteous it may be a war that needs to be fought like world war ii was and you don't owe your country nothing you owe it something and you may owe it your life depending on the circumstances and if a war comes along that you feel is immoral and unnecessary then it's your duty to protest and go to prison if you need to to protest it but you don't know that yet and you're gonna sign that card because you are part of this country and it's a magnificent thing to be part of and that completely turned around my thinking about um what it means to be an american citizen and a human being and to be part of a community uh you know it was i mean you know what whatever it's it's 40 35 years later i'm still chewing over that one yeah um so you weren't really i mean yeah you were probably a teenager as vietnam was coming to an end what were your dad's thoughts on that i mean did he kind of view that as a different war from world war ii i mean obviously it was but um how did he kind of vocalize that to you oh a totally different war he's unnecessary and you know the the the um the the the the specter of communism taking over the world you know he didn't believe that that was you know the gulf of tonkin was it was a straight up lie right so unlike 911 vietnam started with with a a a straight-up lie and they got us into a war that everyone knew was sort of unwinnable and a lot of people thought was was not needed and uh which was very very different from and and and from world war ii as far as my dad was concerned um so he you know he hated the vietnam war and and uh um was very um you know very very adamant about it as was every other adult i knew i mean it speaks to the community i was in i could have grown up somewhere else and it would have been the opposite but i didn't but it is it does sort of speak to his ability to kind of balance simultaneous uh seemingly simultaneous contradictory facts which is that he could look five years later right vietnam ends in what 74 75 they're pulling the last troops out and in you know just five years later you're getting a card that is effectively you know a draft card and yet he can immediately pivot and say well wait a minute no no this is very important and i can put vietnam out of my mind and say yes again there's a recency bias that could have easily sounded like i don't want my son being what you know one of the boys that got you know slaughtered there for no reason well he made it clear to me that if it's an immoral war my job is to go to prison to protest it if i need to like to say absolutely not right you're not going to use me for your immoral your immoral designs right but you know equally strongly i mean the holocaust burned my dad was half jewish i'm a quarter jewish right i mean i don't identify in any cultural way with that quarter of me but um you know the holocaust seared itself into the minds of humanity uh in the 1940s and the sacrifice of american soldiers now america acted you know out of its own interests and thought process it didn't join world war ii because of the holocaust but the fact is that there are thousands tens of thousands of american troops buried in france his home country of france um stopping fascism uh making sure that fascism did not take over western europe and the world and and that's his home country right and he's seeing the graves of american soldiers young men his age right i mean his his contribution to that was you know when they fled paris and the germans had um they took paris you know without a fight it was a negotiated surrender and they sent advance units and tank homes deep deep into france to grab the the spanish border and uh which of course across the border was franco it was a friendly regime and that friendly fascist regime so my f my my father and his family fled by car and they were in bayonne and he said he was out he was 18 he's walking down the street and he sees a a a german officer on foot in front of a column of tanks and they're creeping down a boulevard and the officer turns to him and says do you know which way it is to the center of town because they didn't know they didn't have maps they didn't know right this and my father um spoke german i mean he spoke just about every language in europe because they lived all over the place my father was born in dresden he spoke german about you know that the german officer was speaking bad french my father spoke back to him in perfect german and and lied to him and said yeah the center of town's that way and pointed the entire tank column in the office opposite direction and off they went so that was his little act of rebellion right and uh um his dad said don't ever be that stupid again because they will kill you if they if he found that out he would have killed you right there right so so my father you know that kind of experience doesn't doesn't leave you and he is his um his for he you know he thought the world the foremost threat to to to freedom and human dignity in the human and the human race was fascism in his mind so vietnam was a blip in the screen with that right i mean fascism was it and and you know i would argue it still is it like that is still the threat and we've this country has gone through a little taste of it and uh you know we came out hopefully stronger but that you know that boogeyman has not gone away in human society so when did you uh decide what you wanted to study in college and what did you study in college um i grew up my my dad you know was a physicist but he was very enamored of history and of anthropology and i grew up reading anthropology anthropological works i was very interested in the native native american society societies and um uh i was also a really good long distance runner in high school in college i ran a 412 for the mile and went on to run 221 marathon so i had some you know not not world class obviously not even close but i was like a pretty good runner and i found out uh in college that the navajo were really good long distance runners and you know when i was in college i wasn't in college to get a career i was in college to learn stuff that interested me which was anthropology right and a number of other things and uh and so i majored in anthropology and i decided to do field work on the navajo reservation and i went out there uh 1983 i think it was and spent a summer on the reservation training with their best guys and i wrote a thesis on navajo long distance runners and that was the first time like i researched something and then wrote about it you know basically the work of journalism so when i got out of college i did construction for a little while trying to figure out what i was going to do and i was on a sponsored by uh um etonic running shoes i was running local road races i was a sponsored athlete at a sort of like regional level and uh trying to figure out what am i gonna do with my life and i don't know maybe i'll be a journalist like that's pretty close to what my thesis was and i when i was writing my thesis i was just on fire and i just loved it i was a very middling student and the thesis i was i got honors and i just i was like oh i'm going to be a journalist it was a long tortuous path to get there but that was my sort of naive decision when i was 21 or whatever now i remember hearing you in an interview years ago i don't remember which interview it was but you talked about a job you had felling trees you were you were kind of in a logging job where was that and and how old were you was that post college as well you know it was uh yeah yeah i was post college uh that was i was in my late 20s so you know like fast forward some years out of college i still haven't figured it out right i'm still not trying to be a writer trying to be a journalist basically i don't have a clue and uh but i'm reading a lot a lot of good writers peter matheson joan didion ernest hemingway a lot of great writers and i'm writing and writing and writing and getting occasional things published but i'm turning into a better writer but i couldn't make a living and i was sick of waiting tables and i got a job as a climber for tree companies and so it wasn't logging it was residential tree work right and you need climbers you need if you don't have a crane you need a guy up in the tree on a rope with a chainsaw you know i was a pretty athletic young man and and i took to it very very quickly and i was good at it and you know basically you're swinging around on a rope with a pair of climbing irons you know strapped to your legs and to your feet and uh with a chainsaw and you have to you know i was taking down these big big trees some of them you know 100 you know white pines 100 feet high topping them out and taking them down in a fault in a small space like i can take a tree down in a space that's the size of the like footprint of the tree right like i mean the size that the tree is viewed from above i can take a tree down in that space with ropes and a chainsaw and a climbing saddle and by the way i just want to point out how familiar i am with this because of my middle child who's just turned seven but he's obsessed with this process and there's this series on youtube called pine tree removal part one pine tree removal part two and pine tree removal part three each of these videos is about two hours long so it's taken together it's a six hour series exactly as you're describing it which is a 120 foot pine tree in a subdivision between two houses that are 30 feet apart and it has to come down and the six hour video is how long it takes to take bring the tree down minus any spaces so it edits out you know the pauses and the lunch breaks and the bathroom breaks but basically there are three major sections that have to come down so they go to the top they trim all the branches cut the first part it comes down they just keep doing this well i think my son has seen the entirety of that 30 maybe 40 times so by extension i've seen it like three times awesome he knows every move meaning wherever you are he'll tell you okay that guy he's gonna take his chainsaw and he's gonna cut this thing at that angle and then once he gets that branch down he's gonna wrap around this thing and then he's gonna cut this thing at this angle and then they're gonna do and i mean it is it is his obsession he when he turned five he wanted a chainsaw for his birthday and he was so upset that he didn't get it and i tried to explain to him like dude like you'll kill yourself with this thing and he's like i will not like i know how to use this thing i mean he was convinced he knew how to use it because he'd watched so much pine tree removal so you would literally be his hero that's awesome well listen i have a buddy who runs a tree company and he had and he had a he has a as a girl as a teenager now but she you know when she was young yeah seven eight years old whatever he got her he set her up on a climbing rig and uh you know a little harness and he set the ropes up the way climbers use and she learned how to like work her way up uh you know a rope and and repel back down and it was all you know six feet off the ground it was all you know safe and uh you so you might if you if you could find someone arborist in your town to come you know rig that up for you your son would love you forever which i'm sure he will anyway but he'll love you even twice twice as much forever well the compromise is we got him a gomboy you know one of those big saws when he was five and at first i wouldn't let him touch it without me being right there and then i figured out okay he actually knows how to use this thing without killing himself and now he's out there running around in the woods with a saw that's almost as long as him just trimming every dread dead branch and when people come over and see it they think we are the worst parents in the world right because like who would let a kid that little use a saw that big but i mean i think you know that they get a healthy respect for it i think he will be using a chainsaw before the age of 16 which was when i told him he could have one that's awesome that's awesome well one thing to say about that work um i uh i mean i'm scared of heights and i had to kind of control that fear to work that high up in the air was that part of the appeal like was that were you doing this to overcome that fear or was that no no no no i was doing it because i could make 500 000 bucks a day back in the early 90s wow and uh yeah you know if i contracted my own job and did the climbing and you know i could make pretty big money so i could work a couple of times a week and that's the rest of the time i could i could train i could write i could do whatever i wanted so for for you know for a young man it was a perfect job for me and so i you know i i uh i wouldn't say i'm without my anxieties and fears but i have a fairly high risk tolerance and what i figured out about treework was that there are no accidents it's like there are no accidents in the game of chess like you play poker and you might just draw the wrong card right uh there are no accidents in chess if you lose a chess game is because you lost the chess game because you made worse moves than the other guy right same thing with pretty much no chance and there's complete information at all times that's right that's right if you get hurt or killed doing tree work it's because you you screwed up right you're dealing with the laws of physics they're immutable right and if you do a front cut wrong and you top out a tree wrong and it comes back on you it's because you did it wrong right and you didn't take into account the wind direction and if you whatever i mean just there's ev there are no variables that are outside of your control your own stupidity is the or carelessness is the only thing outside of your control and you can control that and so when i figured that out i'm like all right i'm just going to make sure i don't screw up i screwed up once and i hit my leg with a chainsaw and tore it up and you know took a while to recover from that but that was that was the injury i needed and after that um you know i actually wouldn't be that scared up there because i knew although sometimes terrifying to look down i knew that i was way safer than i was in a car ironically um as long as i didn't make a mistake and that kind of agency um having that kind of agency over an outcome um unlike driving unlike combat unlike a lot of things that kind of agency was um very uh exciting to have it gave me a kind of zen focus like in the moment like you are here right now do not blow this and that that kind of practice um was you know extremely good for me so talk me a little bit about this process of becoming a better writer i mean it fascinates me to no end because i enjoy writing but i'm obviously not very good at it yet but i'm getting better right like i'm better today than i was 10 years ago and um but when i look at people who do this for a living i'm i'm very interested in what the reps look like what the feedback process looks like is it something that can be done in isolation or is it something that requires an editor or someone who can really sharpen your sword i mean it depends i mean there are some writers some very good writers who basically dump out an incredibly rough first draft and they just in their description sort of vomited out right and some there aren't sentences aren't even complete there are sections like put this stuff in you know put the you know whatever the sailboat stuff in here and then they move whatever and it's it's a very sloppy fast sort of intuitive brain dump and they can do that for 500 pages and then they go back that is not me and people like that often make really good use of an editor who can work through that and kind of see how to begin to shape it i don't do that right i write i'm sort of like a road paver right i mean i go two miles an hour and i leave behind like pretty much finished roadway not that editors don't weigh in at the sort of sentence level like slight this is slightly confusing or you know maybe you want to say more about this because i don't quite understand what you're referring to here other people might you know whatever but i i there's very i i get very little editing from my editors and it's because i'm so obsessive about writing and i go over it and over it and over it and i write very carefully and the stuff that i write is i definitely flawed but not that flawed and um uh and i you know i have this feeling like for me the good writing is a matter of like efficiency like being uh efficient with your words like not quite the minimum possible so the minimum possible words but something close to that and uh fat creeps into your prose very very easily right and you can really pare it down um it's about efficiency and it's about rhythm the sentences need rhythm and then it's about saying things in a way that people have never read before i mean no one ever needs to again to hear someone say the rain drummed on the roof like if you're gonna say the rain drummed on the roof then just forget about the damn rain and move on to the next interesting thing no one ever needs to read a sentence they've read before in someone else's writing and if you really apply that harshly you will get rid of a lot of what you wrote i mean it's amazing how much it's slightly formulaic and you're repeating so mortars are always slamming into hillsides and blah blah blah you know just like get get rid of that stuff and and so rhythm efficiency and originality and if you do that um it's going to be pretty good writing now do you think journalism and storytelling are similar styles because you tend to do both of these well right i mean there's so much of your work is really telling amazing stories it's historical it's anecdotal and then some of it of course is is much more what we would think of as journalism you know reporting on kind of what is happening and trying to provide context around it do you think that i mean first of all i don't think a lot of people do that some people do but that's not that's not the normal way to do things um does this style lend itself equally to both of those disciplines well i mean you know i'm i write long-form journalism or long-form non-fiction and um so first of all there is no non-fiction category that is liberated from the rules of journalism in terms of quote attribution and you know making stuff up or whatever like you know you can't just say oh well it's creative nonfiction so i can you know maybe slide by with a little bit of creative like no you can't like it's either true or it's not true and you can't blend them because then suddenly everything's going to be suspect right so there's some great books that i mean in cold blood truman capote's absolute masterpiece it's a masterful book right but by his own admission he like wove in some stuff that he did not that was not the result of his research like he he richly imagined some scenes no problem right i mean that's i mean it's a masterwork but it's important to understand that that actually is not non-fiction and it's not journalism uh and uh so but just to go on to say that there's a there's a whole food chain of journalism so you know you get a reuters or ap report you know that's written in minutes or maybe an hour um it basically doesn't have a style it doesn't have a literary style right there's a lead paragraph and the follow-up and that you know whatever i mean there's a whole formula to how to construct something that's packed with information and completely charmless in a literary sense totally charmless but you don't want charming writing when you're reading about you know how harare fell to the rebels right i mean whatever you just want the information then there's more long-form journalism where you you can even use the first person if you want i think sparingly but you're allowed to use the first person you're allowed to be a little bit more scene setting you you can use some novelistic techniques with which with content which is completely true and real right but the novelistic techniques might be taking a break at a sort of like a at a compelling moment right before the rebels attack the city right you take a break and then you do a thousand words of backstory about the history of zimbabwe or whatever and then you you know resume where the action stopped like those are all novelistic techniques that are great for getting people to read nonfiction it's just that you're making use of factual material not invented material and so i'm a long-form non-fiction writer and that extends you know for me a book is long form nonfiction it's just very long form so my books some of my books you can read in a couple of hours some of my books you can read a couple of days but basically it's all the same rules and and creative um creative tools of of of getting people to read good good certain narrative journalism so let's fast forward we're into the late 80s right so you've had your you know leg injury by the way if i recall it was an achilles tendon injury correct well yeah i mean i was up in a tree it was an elm tree in welcome massachusetts it wasn't even that high and i was in a hurry i hadn't worn my boots that day because i wasn't going to be wearing climbing irons and uh so i just had sneakers on and uh and i was cutting something below me quickly one-handed with a little climbing saw and i it the tip of the saw hit the tree and it popped into the back of my leg and it tore open right across the achilles tendon it tore open my leg so i turned the saw off it didn't hurt at all i was like something hit my leg there's nothing else moving down there but the saw i better check i just make sure i'm not cut right turn this off clipped it on looked and of course my leg was hanging open and um so i i pulled my leg up as close as i could to see if the achilles was was intact or not i was very concerned about the achilles now keep in mind had it been someone else's leg i mean i'm not a doctor i'm not a medic right i wouldn't have looked inside their chainsaw wound to see if the achilles was intact but you're immediately in shock you know there's this sort of psychological remove when you're hurt and i had no problem pulling the cut open and looking for my achilles i had no problem at all and it seemed to be there it was about the thickness of a number two pencil and was sort of a whitish color and i was like i don't know that looks like the achilles it looks like it's still there so i rappelled down at the bottom of the tree and my crew you know helped me you know helped me to the car and drove me to the hospital i was going to ask you i didn't know if you'd injured it or not and as a runner that's a big deal yeah yeah it was intact i did rupture my achilles in combat uh when i was in my mid-40s when i was in the coringal valley in eastern afghanistan we were moving up a hillside under a big load and and uh and i felt something slap into the back of my leg and there was a lot of you know long-distance sniper activity you know like you don't necessarily he'll hear the bullet that hits you and i was like oh no i got shot i got shot in the back of the leg damn it and uh and i and i pulled the pant leg up and there was no blood i had no idea what had happened to me but it was a partial rupture of my achilles and i sort of lipped on it for a few days and then it kind of healed back together a bit and i was able to continue my imbalance which was about another month or so um i i babied it a little bit but i scraped by and i got physical therapy eventually and healed it so but that was um apparently the the malaria medication that they were giving soldiers larium um mefloquin i think is the medical name uh it it makes people prone to achilles tendon ruptures who knew and we were all on we were all on lyrium out there yeah and fluoroquinolones which are a class of antibiotics ciprofloxacin being the one that probably most people are familiar with has a similar effect as does aging yeah um let's talk a little bit about what you know led you to that right so when was the moment when you realized that you know being a journalist was one thing but being a journalist who went into the um the theater of combat was another and and that was the place you wanted to go yeah so i was living in gloucester massachusetts and that storm that i wrote about in the perfect storm hit that town in 1991 i was still limping around from my chainsaw injury and i was living with my girlfriend and i'd never lived with a woman before and uh um the relationship ended and you know ended pretty painfully and uh and i it's just so you know maybe some sort of weird male reflex or some react male reaction to heartbreak i was like all right i'll show her i'm gonna go to a war like it was just some bizarre like because there was a civil war in bosnia right and i was like all right we're broken up i'm gonna go to a war zone and be learned to be a war reporter and uh i was looking for a big life change i was looking for something sort of that felt meaningful and exciting and that would challenge me to in my mind sort of like complete the the maturation process i didn't still didn't quite feel like i was really a man like i was really mature uh like surely a an ordeal like war will put you over the threshold into adulthood and into manhood and so off i went so every other free i mean like 80 of the other freelancer male freelancers over there had all been dumped by their girlfriend like it seemed to be a sort of common reaction for some reason and uh so i started freelance war reporting over there as a radio uh correspondent and i mean freelance and uh then i wrote my book the perfect storm and the day two days after i turned it in i took a flight to uh delhi and then on into uh peshawar and on into afghanistan it was 1996 and there was a war in afghanista a civil war in afghanistan after the soviets pulled out and i was there as the taliban were taking over in the summer of 1996 and that was my first like official war assignment for a new york uh magazine in new york city and i you know it just was the most meaningful and incredible work i'd ever even imagined and so i kept doing it what did your dad think when you told him you were going to do this was he fully supportive partially supportive ambivalent i you know my my dad he was uh i think he was proud of me i think he was also sort of worried um uh my mom my mom i mean maybe in a kind of classic way she was like why are you doing this to me like she she thought my war reporting was directed at her right like to make her upset i'm like mom i'm not doing it to you i'm just doing it my father didn't take it that way i think he was kind of proud and worried but also war had completely shaped his his life and his family's life in europe and and i said look i'm war is this it's a part of human society it's about a history like i want to understand what it what it is what it's like how it works how i'm going gonna react in that environment and uh i didn't find all of that out in bosnia but it was the beginning of a process tell me more about afghanistan what was that what was that like and did you view maybe give people a bit of a reminder about who the taliban were at the time what the northern alliance was where the jadin what they ultimately became maybe give people a little bit of the refresher about what happened when the soviets pulled out and what was it about 1990 when they pulled out yeah the um the soviets pulled out in 1989 after uh 10 years um the their their sort of proxy government collapsed after a couple of years and it's elapsed in the civil war that was brought to a stop by the taliban takeover in in 1996 the taliban were a a religiously inspired uh political movement that was basically the sort of um brainchild of the isi the pakistani secret service um it was their way of controlling afghanistan and turning in it giving giving pakistan what they called a strategic depth in their fight with india so basically if they controlled afghanistan they would always have a fallback position in case india invaded them which was a threat uh which was a possibility invaded them they always had a fallback position to fight from um and uh but the taliban were you know i mean we all know right they had sharia law it was incredibly harsh they were stoning adulterers and not not letting women go out of the house without a male escort and all kinds of ghastly policies that you know frankly we see in other allies like saudi arabia and doesn't seem to bother anyone particularly it's ghastly wherever it is whether it's a u.s ally or not it's all despicable and i eventually wound up in 2000 with uh the last quadrant of the country that had not been taken over by the taliban was being defended by ahmed shah massoud a legendary guerrilla fighter against the soviets and uh he had organized the tajiks he was ethnic tajik he organized the tajik and some other allied um demographics to hold off the taliban in this one quadrant of um of afghanistan in the northeast and uh so i was with masood um in the fall of 2000 as as he fought the taliban and this was like this was big stuff and these were tank battles these were masked infantry assaults into you know entrenched positions on ridge tops you know it was like very very intense war and extremely traumatic and uh to me at least and um i came back very affected by it psychologically and not even knowing i had ptsd because that term was not being used yet um i just thought i was kind of going crazy but i got back to new york after those two months and i was pretty nuts and uh i couldn't take the subway i couldn't be in a small crowded space i i freaked out in a ski gondola i mean i just had reactions to things i never associated with the combat but it was clearly a byproduct of the what i what i experienced and um i got very angry i had a short short fuse i cried a lot you know all the classic symptoms i just didn't recognize them but at any rate massoud was killed two days before 9 11. yeah this is which is i mean the details of his death are it's just hard to believe he kind of fell for that trick i mean were you surprised it just seems like such a such a ploy that was so transparent in a way but maybe that's only true in hindsight i guess yeah i mean he relied on other people to keep him safe and people can get paid off and whatever i mean you know uh i don't know the details of that but yes it was it was a movie camera filled with explosives and there were two al-qaeda suicide bombers that were posing as journalists and they asked to interview him and they blew themselves up one actually survived the blast and tried to run away and he was gunned down um there was another young man who was a translator who was in the room fahim dashti very very brave young man who um worked in a film office that masud set up to to docu to document his efforts against the taliban and against al qaeda and in my father as my father would have put it against fascism and uh the taliban uh caught him uh last week in the panchayat valley north of afghan and north of kabul and executed him for his work with masood there were four men in that office 20 years later 20 years later there were four men in that film office working for massoud documenting the war against the taliban and they caught fahim fahim dusty and executed him just a week ago tragic very very brave very very brave man um so at any rate uh uh after after he was executed 911 after massoud was killed two days later 911 happens clearly part of the same strategic thinking by al-qaeda and uh and as soon as i could i rushed back to afghanistan through dushanbe in tajikistan and joined the commanders i've been with the year before and i was sleeping on a you know in my clothes on the front line for a for a month straight until the american bombers had done their done their work and then the northern alliance i mean i never saw an american soldier you know there are a few sf guys special forces guys out there but it was all northern alliance foot soldiers they broke through the taliban front lines on november 13th i think it was 2001 and we followed them uh in the back of a pickup truck and uh we poured we we walked into kabul the following morning passed a pile of dead bodies um and uh i walked into kabul and the the jubilation by the populace that being liberated from the taliban was indescribable when people found out i was american they would come up and hug me for what our country did to liberate them from from the taliban extraordinary moment for me as a person and uh but we were so filthy we smelled so bad after our month sleeping in the front lines uh that we tried to get a taxi you know there's taxis and whatever in kabul like the you know and and we tried to get a taxi and the driver would not take us he said you guys smell too too bad too too awful for my taxi you're gonna have to be i think we walked across kabul and found a place like a hotel where we could um you know where we could stay in the sort of chaotic first moments of liberation i want to go back a little bit to kind of the the the precursor or or really what what caused this first bout of ptsd um because again i'm still kind of you know i've seen i've seen i've seen your your documentaries so i i kind of have a sense of what this is like but i'm assuming there are some people listening to this who haven't but when you're reporting in a war it's it's very different than if say you know you're a wall street reporter and your job is to cover this sector this this banking sector or uh you're covering this beat on sports like you know there's a distance between you and your subjects in most other forms of reporting that i think can't really exist in the war if for no other reason then you are literally physically with your subjects yeah so let's just put the danger aside for a moment the fact that you're kind of embedded with your your subject matter um is am i missing an example is there another example of where that's also common in journalism well let me let me just say that you you you can have an emotional connection to anybody right yeah i'm saying this is physical though right like you're you're cohabitated with you're dependent on let's even be more specific right you you you know you you you presumably are they're helping you they're keeping you safe right well there's two issues one is emotional connection which you can have with anybody frontline nurses or cops or sanitation workers or teachers or whatever you can emotionally connect with people and be affected by their emotional reality because you're starting to share it and invest in them and become empathic to them sensitized to their issues and it's a very powerful experience right um in addition in in a war um if you're anywhere near the front line you're exposed to risk and you're exposed to um not that you aren't in other places but you're exposed to human suffering right and human suffering is incredibly traumatic to behold right and um particularly if you yourself feel removed from it so one of the most one of the hardest things that ever happened to me psychologically was i was in liberia during the civil war and a mortar round landed in a crowded field of refugees who had fled the fighting and crammed into monrovia and you know i was i was sort of in hiding the government thought i was a spy the liberian government thought accused me of being a spy i was sort of in hiding so i was having my own like terrifying thing go on right um uh because i thought they might torture or kill me if they caught me so i was having my own issues but in addition this field full of people men women children i mean our mortar landed right in the middle of them and quill killed 27 people a lot of them children right and they brought the bodies and piled them in front of them and i was out when the mortar hit i was out i mean i hit the ground i was very very very close and i hit the ground right i mean we it was a bad situation and um sometime later um they piled the bodies up in front of the u.s embassy as a protest that america was not invading they wanted america to invade liberia and stop the war right that was what the populist was what the civilians wanted right and they piled these bodies up in front of the um embassy and i had to walk past i walked past them on my way into the embassy to because i was trying to get evacuated because i was in so much danger and i stopped and my mind just went blank and there was children there was a you know i mean it's hard even now for me to talk about it and it was almost 20 years ago and um i i went into shock i didn't know what to do and and i started counting them and i thought uh someone needs to know what this number is it was 27. so later the trauma to me was that i'd had no emotional reaction to such a horror i mean i was completely in shock and i had no it it was a completely abstract thing right i had to it was a psychological defense and that psychological defense finally broke down a week or two later when i finally got out to paris and got to safety and i was sitting in a cafe waiting for my girlfriend who was joining me in paris i had a couple of days to kill i was sitting in a cafe smoking a cigarette and i saw some two men carrying a mattress across the street and it sort of sagged in exactly the same way that a body does and i just went into a full-blown panic attack because i knew i was looking at a mattress my body react my the rest of my mind reacted to body dead body i'm in a war zone i completely panicked and you know i still have trouble talking about that without crying i mean i still have to even now sort of choke back the sort of emotions and that was almost 20 years ago so human suffering and that was what happened when i came back from afghanistan i saw an enormous amount of human suffering and particularly bloody gruesome visually bloody and gruesome sort and i came back altered and i also you know we got shelled very very badly by the taliban you know there was nothing we can do about it we just basically got spanked by katusha rockets for an hour i mean it killed our horse our pack horse got killed because the horse couldn't get down like we were we survived that but you know all that was enormously traumatizing and and now the danger stuff that i've been through is easy to process it's no problem it's the suffering it's the dismemberment that you see particularly with children that you see that you never goes away and and uh i still have to be careful talking about it because i will get choked up and then you know then it's a that's a process that i can't stop once it starts did you ever read the book um one i think it's called one bullet away by nate fick nathan fick no i've heard of it i haven't read it yeah it's a great book he was a marine um and he wrote about his his his tours in i believe it was mostly iraq i can't recall if he was also in afghanistan um but one of the things that i remember being very keen to as as kind of a subtext of this was we focus a lot on mortality in in combat you know the number of people who have died but there are lots of people who don't die who are forever scarred and i mean physically let's emotional is that's we have a lot of attention being paid to that fortunately but you know i thought back to my experiences in uh in in surgical training um which was at a really really busy trauma center in baltimore so you're really you're you know arguably one of the most violent cities in in the united states and lots of patients died right so sometimes they would arrive dead um they were you know when the paramedics got to them they were alive by the time we got to the hospital they were dead others would arrive alive but never made it out of the trauma bay or they would die in the operating room or they would die a few days later as a complication of too much blood loss or sepsis or something like that but there were a lot of people who didn't die who did leave the hospital but their lives would never be the same again right they you know trans pelvic gunshot wound which is normally fatal by the way a trans-pelvic gunshot wound is almost a universally fatal injury because of the vascular vasculature in there and how difficult it is to get that bleeding under control so sometimes the best victory you can have in that type of a gunshot wound is to sacrifice a limb you know you'll you'll you'll have to ligate the femoral artery in vain which means you'll lose that leg but you'll save the life and you think well that person's not the same and i just remember reading nate's book and thinking how many of these marines lived but we kind of forget their story of how injured they are going forward it's almost like that's what you're talking about right it's like it's that suffering in these other folks who then live and they're they are to themselves and others a reminder of this trauma and again that's just the physical side of it the psychological piece again i could be potentially worse i'm not sure yeah um you know there's a very moving command at some military events uh with older veterans and um and the command is you know to stand to stand for the for the flag or whatever it may be and the command is stand as you are able acknowledging that some people would like to be able to stand and can't and shouldn't shouldn't feel ashamed of their of their inability to stand stand as you are able uh very very dignified moving acknowledgement of the cost of war between bosnia and when you're trying to get evacuated from the american embassy is probably a dozen years were you during that period of time aware of what was ptsd in you or were you still sitting there in that cafe in paris unclear as to why you were having this reaction oh god i had no idea why i was having that reaction it was exactly 10 years 93 in bosnia 2003 liberia i'd been in a bunch of wars in between you know in between those but um no i had no idea um i i spent 15 minutes thinking i was going to be executed by rebels in sierra leone uh i mean some bad things happened you know and and they always had an effect on me and i always just thought oh i i'm just losing it what's wrong with me you know and i the the nation was not talking about ptsd and i didn't know anything about it and you know some of the reactions are relate or i mean there were no ski gondolas in afghanistan right it was so why would i relate panicking and ski gondola to combat in afghanistan i wouldn't i just thought i was going nuts and you know finally i was at a i was a party and and the wife of a older friend of mine older woman uh was a psychiatrist she was asking me sort of outside of curiosity you know is this right after we'd invaded iraq and uh around 03 around the same time and she said have you all this combat you've covered you ever had any you know psychological consequences i was like no i don't think so uh um no not really i'm good um and then i was like i mean i did start to have panic attacks once in a while but i don't think it had anything to do with combat i mean they're just you know i don't know and she was like you know you'll find that that probably was connected to combat and um there's something called ptsd and you know keep in mind this is early on in the iraq war right when we're having this conversation she said i think america is going to be hearing a lot more about ptsd in the coming years but you might want to look into it because actually i think you're having you're suffering more consequences than you realize she was absolutely right how did you receive that at that point in time oh i was enormously relieved right i was like oh this is a normal reaction like the kind of freak show i can produce in a subway platform in new york city isn't just my unique and pathetic weakness and neurosis this is actually a normal healthy reaction to trauma uh and you know what would happen is that the traumatic reaction would dissipate over time you know it would be the strongest when i got back or within a week or two of getting back and then it would dissipate and dissipate and after you know it's like you know it's like a year later i don't care how heartbroken you are that your girlfriend broke up with you a year later you know you're pretty good you know what i mean i mean you can sort of think about it and have some thoughts but but you know basically it's not invading your daily experience like it might a week later right and likewise with ptsd you know for for you know i think the statistic is about 80 percent of people a year out from the trauma they uh 80 have fully recovered and regained a a normal functioning healthy life which doesn't mean they're not changed by it right you can be changed by something but not in a a psychologically dysfunctional state and um you know you're always gonna you know the the grieve your your mom's death or your their divorce or whatever it may be you can all you know you may always grieve that that doesn't mean that you have a psychological issue what was the reaction of others um it sounds like at least you had one girlfriend during this period of time who was probably witness to some of this or were you shielded or were you somehow able to sort of shield these anxiety attacks and panic attacks from others oh i i was you know i i mean my the panic was going on internally i mean i was literally white knuckling it and pouring sweat right and um i would all i was i would conceal it as much as i possibly could and i think i was successful um uh from anyone around me and i never told anybody about it until later but not no not immediately afterwards or no i i i i wasn't something i wanted to share so the war in iraq starts in march of 03. when are you next back in combat so i went i i refused to cover iraq i thought it was a mistake and a travesty and had that it had nothing to do with 911 and i didn't want to get killed covering a mistake and i didn't think i could be unbiased in my reporting so i didn't cover iraq um but by 2005 the war in afghanistan which was an easy win initially uh because it was so underfunded undermanned um no one was focusing on it because of iraq it didn't go that well and what was an easy win and we had the gratitude of of the majority of you know the strong majority of afghan citizens we did not follow through and so by o5 the taliban insurgency has started to like it just you know this tires have started to grip now they're not just spinning their wheels they're actually starting to get some traction and the americans are starting to really take some casualties and i think they were losing a soldier every three days in 2005 and they were starting to get into some pretty good fire fights and uh i was like damn that's who saw that coming right it was so it looked like it was such a successful 0-1 looked so successful um so i thought i want to know what it's like to be an american soldier in combat you know having grown up in vietnam it never occurred to me that i would that that would interest me journalistically and it never occurred to me that the u.s military would allow unfettered access of the sort that i might find interesting i mean i don't want to just go to press conferences and have some you know public relations major told me you know give me some spin about what's going on like that doesn't interest me right so but it really looked like uh george bush sort of made good on his promise to provide full access to american journalists or journalists of any country on the front lines with american soldiers i was like all right i'm in i want to see how this what this is like and um so i was in zabul province with the second of the 503 the same unit i profiled later in afghanistan um battle company and uh you know we were in a you know you know minutes after stepping out of a blackhawk getting depo you know delivered to a unit that was in the fields doing a combat operation minutes after stepping out of the blackhawk i was in a pretty good firefight i mean rpg almost hit me you know i mean boom all of a sudden i'm in combat with american soldiers and uh you know i just couldn't believe the intensity of the fight and the quality of the soldiers like these guys it was all men in this unit i mean these guys were working so hard right physically i mean the mortar teams were carrying 160 pounds 160 160 pounds on you know overnight combat patrol movements you know dusk to dawn without with basically carrying their own body weight on their back right i mean un unbelievable they were working way harder at this to repeal to rebuild this other country than anyone i knew ever worked in college any of my buddies in college they never worked as hard at anything you know and i was just i really liked those guys and uh and i was like i want more of this like if this unit goes back to afghanistan in two years it was a two year cycle of deployments if they go back to afghanistan i'm going to follow them for a year and see what it's just document one platoon in one place for one year and document that with a video camera and by writing a book my book became war the book war and the the the documentary that i made with my friend and brother tim hetherington i was called versus trepo what did you learn about those guys in terms of their motivation um how many of them saw this as a duty a direct response to what happened on 9 11 in the way that i suspect many young men saw what happened on december 7th 1941 as their moral obligation to go and do something about it versus how many of them would you infer were looking for a sense of purpose as the primary objective for which this became a vehicle to to do it i don't know if my question makes sense right one is like purely in response to 9 11. i hate that i have to do this i don't want to do this but i see no higher calling versus i need to find the sense of purpose i mean none of the guys i knew joined the joined the military despite hating it like they they i mean uh i mean they may well have joined up out of a sense of patriotic duty after 9 11. absolutely but i think a lot of those people were from families that had a military history that probably had male relatives that served in one war or another uh i mean prior generations um a lot of them honestly were young men that were just wanted to test themselves in combat you know i mean you can join the military and not be in a combat unit right the combat units do not want people that don't want to be in combat units there are enough young men that are quite psyched to experience combat in fact very driven to experience combat worried that the war is going to be over before they get to experience combat there's enough young men like that that um you can fill those front line combat units with entirely enthusiastic soldiers and um you know if you know if anything it's sometimes hard to get those guys to give it up uh to give combat up and i think that was probably true in vietnam as well uh i've read letters from american civil war soldiers and soldiers in world war one talking about how the war was the some of the best days of their lives you know veterans of these world war one in the civil war i mean bloodbaths right you know letters saying those those were some of the most meaningful days of our lives and we miss it right so and the you know this casualty rates were horrific you know now the casualty rates are a lot less and a lot of the guys that i knew out there really really missed that experience of combat and i just read in in the washington post that the taliban fighters now sort of have nothing to do because they won the war and that they are openly saying that they miss the fighting like that they they they're already nostalgic for the war that they fought and um so you know you get people like that you get men like that um they're out there they maybe they join after 9 11 because of zero patriotism or a history of family history of service uh but i would say the majority of them were like pretty psyched to see themselves as yeah man i was in combat i saw the real thing and i did okay you know like a lot of them were like that and how much of that do you think is the desire to prove themselves in in the theater of combat versus the sense of connection that must come from that i have a number of friends who are former former special forces guys and certainly one of the things they talk about is the trust you must have in your other soldiers right it's it's sort of one thing if you're working in an office building and you say to your colleague hey would you mind tracking this thing down for me because i you know i need that piece of information and you're closer to it can you grab it for me and and you've got to trust that they're going to pull it together for you by next day when you need it it's quite another thing when you're in combat and you ask someone to do something where you know literally somebody's life is on the line which is not to say that everything you ask is of that gravity but enough things are i've never experienced that right like i've never had to ask somebody to do thing to do something where my life depends on it and nor have i been asked to do something where someone else's life depends on it outside of medicine i guess i'll carve out you know trying to help a person who's been injured so i have to imagine that that's that sense of purpose that sense of fulfillment that comes from both leaning on somebody and being leaned on is it is exceptional do you think that ultimately that is the thing that hooks people yeah i mean i think we are humans are wired to respond positively to behaviors and traits that were adaptive in our evolutionary past and clearly if people that go through danger together are loyal to each other in facing that danger and considered that that group that's faced and survived danger together has a special unique bond and that thing makes us us right that describes human groups since the dawn of time right humans lived in groups of 30 40 50 people typically in the you know 90 of our evolutionary past and that loyalty to others who are loyal to you in the face of an you know an attacking lion or another human group that's you know coming to kill you like that reaction is completely that is very very adaptive and adaptive things feel good the things that keep us alive and allow us to procreate and survive they feel good and that's why we do them and that's how evolution works and so that groupon that mutual group bonds is completely intoxicating and you have not experienced that but you are hardwired to be receptive to it even at the sort of neurochemical level of dopamine and oxytocin like you are hardwired to be receptive to it and to grow to want it and to need it and it would take you some hours in a dangerous situation with some other people to pretty quickly start thinking these are my people you know we survived the plane crash together i'm alive because of them and i pulled this other guy out of the water and it's going to be days till we're rescued and this is now our tribe and you are you know it happens in prisons and it happens in all kinds of situations like that's what humans are and it's an extraordinary thing and other animals don't quite have it in the same social way that humans do um one of the profound things about humans is that humans are will will be willing to die for a same-sex peer that they're not related to um and i'm not going to talk about women because i'm not a woman i haven't studied it but so i'll restrict my conversation to men a man will die for a same-sex pure that he's not related to not his cousin not his brother just another dude who happens to be in the platoon and that arrangement where they each they might not even like each other i mean there's this one guy in the platoon i was with said to me you know 708 when i was in the corolla valley brendan o'byrne was still a good friend of mine he's like you know it's funny there are guys in the platoon who straight up hate each other but we would all die for each other now if you're in a group that has that arrangement with each other it's not even dependent on feelings that's a very secure place to be as a young man as a human being and there are a lot of groups that function that way you know i know some i know some guys in the fdny the fire department in new york city completely functions like that um the willingness to overlook your own safety and your own concerns for the sake of the group um is the people that are in that position you know strangely they don't feel like it's an onerous responsibility or obligation they feel that it's a privilege and that they're honored to be in that role that they're they're special they are special and i interviewed a fireman in the late 90s a sort of storied fireman named pat brown i mean anyone in the fdny would know that name and you know he went into the world trade centers on 9 11 uh and his last call was from a um you know an emergency phone at the 30th floor of one of the trade centers saying it's pat brown we're on the 30th floor and and and we're going to keep moving is casualties coming down and we're going to keep moving upwards and he led his men upwards until the buildings collapsed and the ability for humans to do that for each other is a profound thing and it's what makes human society possible so there's two things that i want to understand a bit better sebastian actually several let's go back to the beginning 10 000 years ago you and i might have been in a group of 30 or 40 as you said it's really unders i understand very clearly why the 30 or 40 of us would have been inseparable and even put aside personal differences because we actually needed each other to survive like there's no one human that could have survived 10 000 years ago in isolation right you couldn't have got enough food provided enough shelter and and and provided enough security from animals and other humans so so we take that off the table and we realize there's some minimum effective group size that was necessary just to survive and anybody who tried to deviate from that wasn't going to now let's use the example which is well that can be scaled somewhat and you look at firefighters so i i'm very close to a firefighter who was a was a fire chief in san jose um was devastated in a way that i think many people wouldn't have been during 9 11 because he understood very clearly that his brothers died that's the that's the language he used his brothers died on 9 11. and we were actually talking about this recently because of the 20th anniversary and he said he has no doubt that had he been there that day he would have died like that's not something that he thinks so i wonder what i would have done no he knows what he would have done so that's that's a very interesting bond to me because it scales what we just talked about at the 30 to 40 people level his his tribe is much bigger than 30 to 40 people right now you go one step further which is the story of pat brown which is his tribe now includes a whole bunch of people who were not firefighters he wasn't going from the 30th floor up to get firefighters out he was going to get civilians out and you can say well okay that was his job but i mean that kind of strikes me as a answer right i mean i don't think he was just doing it because it was his job he was doing it because he felt some higher duty some higher calling so now his tribe was even larger than just all the firefighters it was all of the people that were in danger all of this suggests that this connectedness can scale beyond as a group of 30 to 40 people do you agree with that i i do to an extent i mean i would say that your fireman friends you know we were all americans were virtually all morally emotionally wounded on 9 11. and these were american firefighters that died and you were talking to an american firefighter it's possible that if an equivalent story you know happened in germany or zimbabwe or pakistan he might not quite have grieved his pakistani brothers who had died in a building collapse in in lahore i mean i don't you know what i mean like that so it might have been more the american connection than the occupational connection yeah i mean yeah those are my brothers and they're my brothers partly because we share the same country and this country was attacked and you know i mean there's there's there's layers there's different layers of affiliation and we definitely you know humans have a kind of symbolic a capacity for symbolism where okay i may not know you but you're wearing the same insignia you're wearing the same uniform you're doing the same job i do i can relate to you like i got you we may not know each other i may not love you like a brother but i respect you and uh you know i might risk my life for you you know and you know one of the things i mean if you're going to become a firefighter one of the sources of pride is that you take care of a a vulnerable population that's what you are right you're a sheepdog i mean you you know that's and and so pat brown went up those you know went up those stairs with his with his with his brothers right because that's what they do and they were doing it together and that's that it wasn't he didn't even come up for review or should we do this or not like if you're gonna review that you're not gonna be in the fire department like just get out now they all know that i'm sure there are people that actually like uh you know what i just found out i'm not a firefighter today i'm actually not a firefighter i'm going to get out of here and the fire department doesn't want you in there either right i mean they didn't want anyone in a second platoon battle company in the coronal valley like they didn't you know in some level didn't want to be there like they don't no we don't need you you don't need us like we'll put you somewhere else where you're not a danger to yourself and others and um so you have to understand that sacrifice is part of a way that pat brown probably saw himself uh his his is the meaning of his existence to some degree came from his role as a fireman so of course he went up the damn stairs you know and uh that's what a fireman does and um but so so i i mean but i understand where your question is leading is like is it possible to feel affiliated with 300 million people like can we feel affiliated as a nation um even if we don't know each other and yes because humans are capable of symbolic thought um and and uh and we're capable of understanding intellectually oh we're all americans like uh i might you you and i might be different races you may maybe you don't even speak english you know maybe whatever you could have enormous differences between individuals but there's some concept when my father came to these shores and arrived in baltimore off of portuguese freighter transporting cork from lisbon called the santome and they landed in in baltimore and he stepped ashore and the immigration official welcomed him he looked around and he knew he was in a country like no other it was filled with every race and language of the world and he quickly discovered that and that's human's ability for abstract thought um of course it's not that hard to cleave that either as we've been seeing in the last few years but yeah it's an extraordinary thing where do you think that was at its peak in american history world war ii the sense of unity that is that sense of when were we most a tribe in the abstract sense and at the largest scale after 9 11 for sure um i think world war ii uh you know there was curfew in new york that was enforced there was a huge you know can and metal collecting operation because the the armed forces needed metal aluminum i can't remember what but you know there was a whole drive to collect cans i mean there was like a huge amount of national undertaking that everyone understood stood we're in this together you know buy war bonds all that stuff um the depression was another time um i mean i knew i knew he's passed away but he who was young during the during the the dust bowl and the in the great depression out in um uh missouri and uh he said that the uh that the schoolhouses would be left open at night you know these are one-room schoolhouses right this is the 1930s in american west and midwest uh that the schoolhouses would be left open unlocked because migrant families you know people were on the move with children and you know they were poor they were destitute they were desperate they were looking for work in the dust bowl and they would be you know driving horse and cart across the land and they needed places to sleep with their children and so every town left their schoolhouse open so that these migrants could enter with their children and sleep in a safe protected place and they would leave before class started in the morning and every school had a well so they would have water for the water for the horses you know and that's the kind of communalism that um typifies a a a nation that's enduring a great hardship and then they're sort of looking out for one's neighbors and looking out for people that are less well-off than you are you know the blitz in london had plenty of that as well people react very very very very in very healthy ways to that kind of stress i i researched a in my book tribe i researched an earthquake in in italy in 1916 if i remember correctly in avid zone area of zano and one guy they you know they had a 90 something percent mortality rate i mean basically it was like a nuke a nuclear bomb had gone off in that area and 90-something percent of the people died within minutes and uh one of the survivors wrote that the people who were left um there was a complete egalitarianism among this among the survivors survivors didn't matter if you were a criminal or you were rich or you were poor or an outcast or did not matter what you were the people that were still alive regarded each other as equals because there was a matter of survival and and this guy said as soon as in like outside relief got there that that egalitarianism uh ended and he said that the the crisis that the earthquake had given them briefly given them uh what the what the law promises but cannot in fact deliver which is the equality of all people well if you experience that you do not want to give it up and that's one of the things that soldiers experience in combat with each other in a platoon when we think back to our ancestors again even just ten thousand years ago do they live in that state because it was effectively a crisis 24 7. well it wasn't necessarily a crisis but they were subsistence level stone age people that needed everyone to contribute to survive and i'm sure the crises were regular enough that it keeps them sort of bonded together but look if you're a hunter-gatherer society you know there's no getting off the treadmill you got you know you got to keep you got to keep that system going pretty much continually now they've done studies of even in very harsh environments like the kalahari desert the native people of that area of the kung that for example um that they worked an average of four hours a day to survive in one of the harshest environments of the world right the average person in industrial society post-industrial society works you know an eight-hour day a 40-hour work week you know so it's interesting as we've gotten more advanced the time requirements for survival have increased not decreased but at that level it does not require full-time effort effort to survive but it does require a full-time cooperation collaboration within the groups do we have any sense of how hunter-gatherers um treated death or how they how they how they responded to loss i mean i'm just going from a very kind of general knowledge right now i haven't made a study of it um there was very little suicide in depression in in hunter-gatherer societies uh suicide was virtually unheard of um uh so the deaths that happened were um uh you know either violent as a result of warfare or dangerous animals or um you know infant losses from disease but if you if if you live through the initial high-risk years a lot of people in those societies lived until into their 70s and 80s you know a long lifespan in western terms uh uh even by today's standards and um i think there's a general feeling that the person had passed on to a realm in which inhabited by other dead people other dead ancestors um and that you'll be joining them soon enough i mean and uh that one of the jobs of the shamans shamanism is a virtually universal human behavior in almost every human society one of the jobs of the shaman is to shuttle back and forth between that world and the world of living you know with important information about how you know how it's going over there and what we need to do we as living people need to do to remain in a right and proper relationship with the dead yeah i mean that's interesting right because it it suggests that the impact of loss was so significant that we needed a way to explain it and we needed a way to to give meaning to life which was in part saying that even when you're gone it still matters and you mattered and you've you might be reincarnated depending on whatever the belief system was that emerged from that um you know i was just recently on an elk hunt and i mean i love hunting but it's it's it's really it's it's it's never lost on me when you kill an animal that that animal lived in the case of an elk that animal was alive for eight or nine years before you killed it right and again i won't get into all the benefits of it and why a certain number of animals uh you're benefiting the herd by removing a select number of them etc but i remember when i shot my elk uh the the just just last you know last week i i remember thinking so first of all as as i watched him die all of the other elk made a circle around him as he bedded down to die now that blew my mind because um i hadn't seen that before a lot of times when the arrow hits the elk he makes noises they freak out everybody scatters but for whatever reason on this occasion the arrow hit him he wandered very very 40 yards he bedded down was making noises like he was dying and he was surrounded by the other elk and eventually they went away when he died you can't help but sort of anthropomorphize that and sort of project your own thinking like what were they thinking like this guy he was the biggest of them and they just watched him die do they understand what that means and will they remember that will they remember that next week it's a silly question because it can't be answered but or at least i don't think it can be answered maybe it has been studied but um it certainly makes me wonder how other species experience loss well here i mean here's just a thought that not a direct answer to that question but it's i think it's an interesting avenue to go down so there are a lot of psychological humans have psychological mechanisms to protect themselves from painful experiences right they go into shock physically if they're in physical pain uh in war there's two different ways of processing the fact that you're killing other human beings the end of the day everyone knows that that's wrong and uh there's a there's a moral burden that comes with it and one way to do it is to convince yourself that they're not fully human you're not really killing humans right it's the enemy they're less than human it doesn't matter right that's a very common one um and it's easy to feel that way when they're killing your friends and you're filled with rage and grief and you're like okay you know pick your you know pick your pick your insult you know you cockroaches you you know whatever you rats you know like they use they resort to animal you know animals to to refer to the enemy to dehumanize them but the other thing you can do is to accord a kind of respect like you're a worthy foe and the greeks did this with the trojans you're a worthy foe now we are going to wipe you out make no mistake about it but you're you're a worthy enemy and we respect you uh we respect how hard you are fighting you're brave we're still going to kill you but we have respect for you that's another way of psychologically distancing from the fact that you're killing people right and they're trying to kill you so there is a moral burden uh often in hunting because you're killing this animal and sort of native native many native peoples around the world they live off hunting right i mean we have to kill the bison and the leopard and the bear and the elephant and what have you in order to survive so make nomen mistake about it we're going to keep doing that but one way to protect yourself protect the hunter psychologically from the sort of moral questions around that any moral pain around that is to say sort of like thank you like thank you elk thank you bison for giving us food to eat we respect you we honor you you know this and there's a whole ritual process that incorporates the death into a a a a a a context of respect right um and so here's what i'm gonna go just go out on a sort of crazy limb here we all know that the miracle of modern society and i don't mean that ironically it truly is a miracle and we can talk about it later i'm alive because some nearly miraculous western medicine intervened when i was dying and saved my life right so on many many levels this society is a miracle it's transcendent we understand the cosmos we understand the human body we i mean i could go on and on you know and we can fly in airplanes and drive cars i mean it's insane right how amazing it is but we we also know that it costs the planet a lot right i mean we are gouging mountains and cutting down forests and polluting the ocean and blah blah blah that's the cost of our amazing society and what's interesting about that is virtually all humans think that nature is beautiful right i mean you can take the most hardcore ultra right-wing like anti-climate change anti-vaxxer whatever they know a tree is beautiful and when you cut down a tree it's less beautiful right we all know that every child knows that we all know that nature is beautiful and the world the planet's a wondrous place it's our home it's our mother earth we all know that and we are basically killing the elk killing the buffalo in order to eat without saying thank you and i think it might change in some ways the whole conversation about environmentalism even if we didn't do anything differently even if we kept strip mining mountains because we need to because we might need to i don't know you know even if we even if we kept cutting down forests because we need trees we need paper whatever i mean i'm not saying we should or shouldn't do anything of that story but if we just added an acknowledgement of the harm and a sort of thank you to the earth for providing our sustenance if we just did did that it would reconcile this sort of like cognitive dissonance of all of us knowing that we hurt something we love in order to exist and liberals hurt the planet just as much as conservatives by the way like the sort of liberal piety oh i drive a prius so i'm good it's complete nonsense right we all need to acknowledge it and i'm just i would just say like we might learn something from native peoples about protecting ourselves emotionally and psychologically from the necessary harm that we do by overtly stating and ritualizing that relationship with the earth and so the next time they flat top a mountain for coal why not bring in a minister a priest a shaman or all three to say thank you to the mountain you know like it won't hurt and it might actually do people the community and the coal miners and all of us that use electricity it might actually do us a lot of good that's just my thought for the week no i i i think it's very powerful and um and i and i i think when it comes to animals in particular because look it's a very controversial topic and you can't talk about hunting without offending you know half the population but you know my view has been if if you choose to eat meat um it's a good idea for you to at least understand what it's like to take a life of what you're eating and to remove the distance between you and the animal you're eating and it will change the way you eat right i mean that you know this will probably be the first year when i will subside entirely on wild game that's been hunted you know ethically and and there's literally been a change in my palate right like i just don't like eating big you know steaks and things that that frankly are a little forced right there's there's really something to be said for this other thing it's not for everybody and i don't feel like i don't feel like i should impose that on anybody and that's just sort of my little two cents on it but i did bring my daughter on a hunt once two years ago and she was only 11 years old and i remember thinking well this could be very traumatic for her because it was a deer and a beautiful type of deer called an axis deer i think the most beautiful animals to look at but when the after the animal died fortunately it died very quickly um i wanted her to come up and kind of lay her hands on it while it was still warm and understand like that you're going to eat this tonight but this thing gave us a gift and and we actually did we sort of went through this exercise you described where we thanked the deer because it was going to feed us and it fed about 40 people that night um and i i she still looks back at that very fondly yeah that must have been a complete absolutely core experience of our human ancestors for you know as i said most of most of human evolution is that relationship with of respect with the animals that had that that you that you fed yourself with um and uh i feel like it's psychologically enormously healthy and one of the things this society is one of the ways in which it's unhealthy is that it has deritualized the vital processes that keep us alive they keep us fed they keep us sheltered uh it's deritualized them and allowed us to actually not acknowledge the harm that we do i mean we all know in our heart right but and then when you can articulate it i mean the difference between hurting someone's feelings and hurting someone's feelings and saying i'm so sorry you know that i hurt your feelings i kind of had to do it we were not a good couple we had to break up but i you know i'm still i'm still hurting from the the sorrow that that that unavoidable decision that i care carry in me you know and i mean there's a world of difference between dumping someone and having a conversation like that right and that's the conversation we need to have with our planet regardless of where you fall on the climate change environmental spectrum i you could be a hardcore you know like i'm driving a vehicle that gets eight miles to the gallon and i don't care about a conservation at all you can be that person too and still acknowledge the harm and it would be very good for you yeah i mean that's a great example of sort of dialectical synthesis and holding these truths seemingly contradictory but together and i agree completely with that um when did you have your how old were you when you had your first child uh i was 55. how did that change your appetite or tolerance for risk because again i i've never taken what you've said to be thrill seeking right i don't think anybody who's read your work would say this is a guy who's you know who's doing this because when he's not base jumping he has to be doing that other thing um but there's no way to deny that what you're doing was very risky um what was the what was that the change in your in your outlook to your own life and the risks that you took um once you became a father well my yeah i mean my my life is not my own now in the sense that if something happened to me um [Music] lifelong consequences would be borne by my wife and my children i have two little girls four and a half and one and a half who are the center of my center of my world right and um you know i would die for them in an instant and my main job right now is to not die right like just to keep myself alive but you know i stopped war reporting i mean so right now i'm in incredibly risk averse right i mean i look both ways before i cross the street i don't cross against the light i um most of the time uh i drive the speed you know whatever on every i i i don't like ladders i mean you know on every like in every avenue i'm very very cautious i stopped war reporting um in 2011 this was right after tim died yeah when my so my colleague out at restrepo opi restrepo where we filmed rastrapo you know where we spent off and on spent a deployment uh with second platoon of battle company 173rd airborne um he was a brother and a colleague and a friend and we were out there together a lot and we made a film together and we went went to nominate for the oscars together and a few weeks after the oscars we were going to cover the arab spring on assignment for vanity fair at the last minute i couldn't go and um and he was killed in the city of misrata by shrapnel that a little piece of metal that hit his femoral artery in his groin and he bled out and um after that i i um i saw what his death did everyone who loved him i mean you know tim um i think i don't i think his death was fairly rapid and painless um and his problems were over but his the people who loved him their problems were just beginning and i watched how that worked and i was like i'm not going to do that to the people who love me i'm you know i war reporting at that point went from seeming sort of noble and uh selfless to something that seemed quite selfish uh and self-concerned and so i stopped i might not have had that reaction at 25 or 30 or 35 or 40 but i was almost 50 and so i stopped and you know i never look i never looked back i've never wanted to go back i miss i miss some of those experiences but i don't want to repeat them given that you've experienced both sides of that sacrifice what does it what does it tell you about the people who can do those jobs whether it be soldiers firefighters uh you know fishermen in alaska uh who also have families who are making those choices and the stakes are i think as high as they could possibly be because presumably they understand what you just said yeah i you know i don't i don't know how they do it um a lot of soldiers don't have kids i mean the guys that i was with out there were mostly 19 20 21 almost none of them had children um so if you did uh but um lots of soul you know lots of soldiers do have kids and and uh you know particularly once you get to the national guard and units like that like oh my god uh and firemen of course you know it's a big very family-centric you know culture um i don't know how they do it and i also don't know how with the fire department the paramedics i mean you know they have children and they're you know they go to car accidents where they're you know they're pulling dead children out of the back seats of vehicles like i mean i mean psychologically i don't know how they do it i don't know how they i don't know how they process the trauma i mean i can't even read a news story about something bad happening to a child i mean literally i can't even read it right i don't know how they do their work that level of trauma that those guys endure and women endure um seeing that and also you know frontline you know er doctors i mean all of it i i mean really i'm just reminded of myself in liberia counting you know counting the bodies in the pile of bodies and like sort of wincing at the children you know like the cost of that later two two weeks two years 20 years later the cost of that i just like i worry about those people i i don't understand how they survive it psychologically when i when i went to medical school i think everybody who goes to medical school has a very clear not everybody but i think a lot of people have a very clear sense of what they want to do they're very specific that's i want to become this kind of a doctor and so for me that was pediatric oncology that was those were the experiences i had seen while i was an engineering student that you know led to my change of heart and led me to decide i want to go to medical school and i remember even interviewing in medical school or for medical schools and at one interview in particular um the the person who was interviewing me who was a surgeon was an ent surgeon you know said well you wrote your essay about this and you want to do pediatric surgery um pardon me you want to do a pediatric oncology um i just want to tell you that i think that's a horrible idea um i one day you're going to have kids and you will not be able to do this job he said right now that might seem like something that you can do but one day you will have kids and that will be the most difficult thing to do is to take care of dying kids now again that's obviously not entirely true because there are lots of people who take care of kids with cancer who have children and i've seen them and i've seen them be completely attached like they're not detached they're not cold they're not calloused but but it was it was at the time a comment that sort of put me off a little bit like who is he to tell me that i can't do that but he was entirely correct now that i have kids i know as sure as tuesday follows monday there is zero chance i could be a pediatric oncologist um it's it's it it's not something i just know that whether that's a flaw or not without judgment i can just say i couldn't do it yeah yeah i i totally understand that i could totally understand that and i'm you know i have two little girls and my sensitivity to harm to children is it's so completely unbounded that it makes it hard to even read the newspaper or go through life you know i mean it's like it it sensitizes you enormously and it's the um in trauma it sounds like you had a sort of traumatic experience in your in your life and i'm sorry to hear that um trauma also particularly sensitizes you and uh and and seeing trauma to the innocent is something that you never you will never fully escape the effects of that like that will not go away i mean my opinion like it's been 20 25 years for some things for me and it's i could it hasn't changed at all in my head like it's the most painful thing i can think of yeah i i think even though i chose to go into something different which was not specifically going to be geared around that you still in surgery saw lots of trauma um we were at a level one trauma center which meant i think we probably averaged 15 penetrating traumas a day and that doesn't tell you about all the blunt traumas so all the car accidents and um so you you were you know death was right always there and you would still see kids die because you still took care of pediatric trauma um and that that that was and remains some of the most difficult stuff i've ever seen by far um which is not to say now that well people dying of cancer isn't horrible but there was something about the at least one had a chance to make amends and it wasn't sudden but there was this thing about the kid dies in a car accident and the parent is had zero chance to prepare for this like if there wasn't one nanosecond of preparatory grieving that could go on i always found that to be the hardest stuff actually even though paradoxically it wasn't always accompanied by suffering on the part of the victim yeah right to your point actually about your about tim yeah yeah no i can't even begin to imagine for the parents and for you dealing with the parrots like ghastly absolutely ghastly i mean now that i you know i sort of knew that abstractly before i was a parent where i was a father but now i really know it in my bones and my mind can't even go there i remember when one boy uh i might even told the story on a podcast once but um he was 15 or 16 years old and he was being driven home from school by his older brother they were going through an intersection when a guy ran a red and t-boned them on the passenger side which is where the victim was sitting he arrived alive but barely and um i was the trauma chief and so for for this type of an indication this is a blunt trauma um and when he's unresponsive it's basically going to be a head injury or massive internal bleeding um you know he's not going to be dead because he broke his bones or something like that it's going to be his aorta was sheared one of the internal vessels was sheared or blunt head trauma to make a very long story short it was pretty clear he was dead due to head injury or dude due to the you know the the response the neurologic exam but it was a vascular injury and he probably should have been declared dead in five minutes but i wouldn't do it we kept i just was adamant that we keep working and you know 30 minutes later i finally conceded he was dead and declared declared him dead um when i went to tell his mom um she was she screamed so loud it's not like in the movies sometimes where people sort of weep softly like this was this was devastating and i remember she tore the pocket off my scrubs um literally grabbed my chest and tore the pocket off my scrubs i spent hours with her i would actually go to his funeral it was one of the very few people i didn't know whose funeral i went to and when you know at this point i'm in a suit right when it came time to walk past the casket she was there i had i didn't think for a second she would remember me i mean because how could she right and there were hundreds of people walking past and she was greeting them all sensibly right when she got to me she did the same thing she completely collapsed grabbed me and tore the pocket off my dress shirt and i was really really moved i mean i just couldn't believe this had happened i i couldn't believe she would even remember some random person although obviously it was such a traumatic experience but i kept that shirt for a very long time as kind of a reminder of something that on a given day can change the course of your life like such a random freak thing and how many lives his siblings and it's just it um it blew my mind but there was there was like a memory within her for this for this interaction separated by days and and obviously by endless um sadness that's brutal that i mean what a what a devastating thing um i'm sorry i'm sorry that's that's a hard thing how do you think we are doing as a society and we can say that's medically or not medically um in terms of treating uh victims of ptsd and and we can even just limit this to to to to combat because i think people can have ptsd for many things that are not combat related um but going back to the friend who said to you in 2003 with incredible insight we're about to get very very familiar with ptsd well she was right how are we doing well i mean not surprisingly for a society that has astronomical levels of addiction depression suicide anxiety compulsive disorders astronomical levels of all of those social ills not surprisingly we're not doing too great on the ptsd fronts um statistically the wealthier the the more affluent with the society the worse the higher the incidence of ptsd right like if you live in an affluent society you are statistically prone to worse and longer ptsd than if you live in a poor society um in a poor society there's an expectation that life is hard so when something bad happens it's not so much of a shock and also in less affluent societies uh in the developing world particularly um people live in more they have a more communal existence because they need each other so if you go to a you know a village in africa or in asia or wherever it may be people are interdependent on one another because they don't have their own like little house in the suburbs in the american suburbs the way i grew up um and that social proximity is a is a buffer for psychological struggles and so suicide is lower in those communities depression rates are lower anxiety is lower even though those lives are stressful in all kinds of ways that ours aren't because we're affluent society so the problem i mean humans evolve to survive we're great at surviving right we evolved in a violent and unpredictable world where people had accidents or were attacked by animals or other human beings all the time and life was traumatizing and if trauma was psychologically incapacitating to a majority of people for any length of time the society wouldn't exist because the group couldn't survive because there'd be no one around to function because everyone's traumatized right so clearly as a in terms of us our species trauma is something that humans are designed to work through fairly quickly because the business of survival has to be attended to and uh so with the the statistics bear this out within you know the for most people the majority of trauma symptoms disappear within three months right and about 80 percent of people wind up with long-term um long-term trauma reaction that doesn't diminish with time so in my opinion i mean i'm not a psychologist a psychiatrist i'm not a doctor i've looked at this as a journalist i've had my own experience with ptsd but in my opinion the problem is in our society is that we see ptsd as something that needs to be treated right the reason there's a long-term problem with trauma reaction i think is partly because we live in such an alienated socially unconnected non-communitarian society people live in incredible isolation um children have their own bedrooms i mean this is the first time in human history that a society has been affluent enough to give children each their own room in a middle class house right insane in human terms completely insane right like not that children don't aren't supposed to be by themselves in the dangerous world you know the people traditionally sleep in groups in human society um that families live in their own automatic you know so self-heated self-sustaining house or apartment unconnected to their neighbors who are unconnected to any sense of community community endeavor is also like completely insane right and completely new in in the human experience and what i would you know what i would say is that the i mean what the statistics bear out is that when people experience trauma communally and recover from trauma communally it goes quite well i looked at a um a study that was done in a in a very war-like tribe in east africa they were raiding society it was a cattle-hurting society of the raiding society and warfare was quite uh normal it still is the warriors that were well connected socially i mean i don't mean status wise i mean that that were that were embed well embedded in the community uh would come back from these very violent raids with you know what sort of startle response and some other sort of surface level trauma reactions like they jump at loud noises or whatever sometimes nightmares you know whatever like but they wouldn't get depression the depression component of ptsd was not something they had to struggle with because they had a healthy relationship with their society the warriors who did not that were not socially connected in a healthy way those are the ones who were prone to long-term depression right so what i would say is that our society is not good at treating ptsd because it's psychologically stressful for everybody and you can um virtually everybody and you can see the results of that in our rates of depression suicide addiction anxiety all those other things again it comes back to this challenge of with modernity has come amazing things right like i don't i would never want to go back and live 10 000 years ago even though i acknowledged that they probably had a much greater sense of community and belonging and purpose because frankly i like that i don't have to worry about my drinking water and i like that you know i'm never starving and i like that there's not a tribe 100 miles away that wants to kill me and all these other things but at the same time the example you gave about children sleeping in the room is a is a such a fascinating one because it's one i've discussed many times with my wife right so everyone who's had kids probably can relate to the fact that at some point um in our experience with three kids it always seems to be about four years of age they stopped wanting to sleep alone right so we were pretty lucky all of our kids were you know sleeping in the crib fine they didn't you know we we had pretty good sleepers but boy when they turned four they were not happy about being alone in their room and what does the textbook say well you know you go through all of the do this do that do this do that but none of the do this do that is bring them in your room right like that's absolutely not the the the sort of textbook thing to do is bring your four-year-old into your bed with you um but of course that's exactly what would have been happening 10 000 years ago so on some level you have to think well gosh we probably evolved to sleep with our children americans are the only mammal that doesn't sleep with its young let's just put it that way and americans and i'm including um you know the british speak the english-speaking world i mean our culture is essentially derivative of of of england and so in england um removing your child from your bed space started in the 1700s and then spread throughout the english-speaking world but it is not the human norm it never has been and it still isn't i mean most of the world sleeps in a communal space uh most of the world is not affluent enough to give their child their own crib in their own bed in their own room if you went camping in the bob marshall wilderness in montana with your family you would not put your wouldn't have five separate tents you wouldn't have five right yeah exactly right you would keep your four month old right next to you right because it's a dangerous world and that four month old knows that and the four-year-old knows that and the thing about i mean infants get their safety from proximity to adults period end of sentence and they know at one month at four months at three years at four years at 10 years they know that if they're by themselves in the darkness their life is in danger think about how profound that is sebastian right because i think i think someone who doesn't have kids might think that sounds strange but i bet that many people listening to this who have kids will appreciate the almost irrational fear that a four-year-old can have of sleeping alone in the darkness but if you think about it through the lens you're describing it which is this is very evolutionarily hardwired it shouldn't be surprising right no it's not irrational and it's not irrational at all i mean in the context of modern america it is um most of the time right but i mean look the big threat to humans were the large cats right i mean in our evolution right and that large cats that hunted at night and so nighttime was a very very dangerous time for humans they found countless human or you know early human skulls with the sort of four prongs of the front teeth of a of a large cat a large feline you know having punctured the skull right and and so a a child or even an adult that was alone in the darkness their life was at risk you cannot fight off a lion by yourself right and unless you happen to have an ak-47 next to you and um so you know people that are surprised at this what i would say to them is look try going camping by yourself go into the woods and see how much sleep you get if you are completely alone in the bob marshall wilderness right now go camping with a group of friends and see how well you sleep you will sleep a lot better because you're in a group right could the group do anything if they were attacked by a grizzly bear probably not like you're probably just at much as much at risk by yourself as in a group but there's something about being alone in the darkness that even makes adults fearful and will not and and they will not get a good night's sleep so you don't believe me just go camping by yourself for a night and see how well it goes and you know children who are um i think the ghastly term is ferberized there was a doctor named dr ferber who wrote a book about how to ferberize your children and get them to sleep in their own room uh you put them quote down put them down early and then you and your wife or husband can have a nice evening on your own um he later recanted everything he taught in the early 1990s there's an article in the new yorker about it and he said he was dead wrong about making children sleep by themselves it was completely it was counter to evolution it was unhealthy for the child it was quite nice for the adults but not even that nice because the screaming of the of the terrorized child you know is is hard to take as well while they're being ferberized so so dr ferber himself actually recanted all of that it's worth tracking down so right now most of most of the world people still sleep with their children and there's a point you know we uh my wife and i have always slept with our children our eldest is four and a half we make it clear to her listen if you want to you know we have some spare mattress in the closet like listen if you want to take that little mattress and sleep in the kitchen or sleep on the couch in the living room you know go for it you don't have to sleep here like you know we have a platform we have a pad on the floor in the what used to be the bedroom uh there's no bed there anymore i'm like listen honey you can sleep wherever you want it doesn't matter at us but you're always welcome in bed you know with the family and and that's where she prefers to sleep another thing that you you do that's pretty different from the average person in america is you don't use a smartphone um obviously that's a very deliberate decision talk to me a little bit about it and and how it's probably made your life better despite the fact that you've given some things up right you can't email people when you're on the run you have to be at a computer to send an email so you've made you made some sacrifices to do that relative to the expectations potentially of others around you because obviously 30 years ago you didn't need to send email let alone send it while you were on the run but we now live in a world where people expect responses and things like that but walk me through the calculation and the trade-off that's led you to decide hey i'm not carrying a smartphone and i'm happier for it i was pretty simple i mean i didn't have to give anything up because i never had a smartphone so i never the idea of sending an email while you're on walking down the street is like insane to me right i mean i just like that's something that happens at your desk when you're working and when you're walking down the street you want to be in the street you know a so you don't get run over by a truck b so that you can observe this like i live in i live in new york city in lower east side manhattan like this sort of bounty of human experience the sheer craziness and wonderment of being part of human society in new york city or anywhere i mean that's i want to i want that right when i'm walking down the street that's what i want to be experiencing and when i'm at home working at my desk and i got to deal with email which is such a sort of tax on our on our energy and our time you know i want to confine that as much as possible it's drudgery and i don't want to invading something sort of to me precious which is the experience of being alive i will also say that you know i wrote a book called freedom uh how humans maintain their autonomy in the face of more powerful forces more powerful societies oppressors um one of the main ways in a modern society that people get deprived of their freedom is through addiction we are an enormously addicted society people are addicted to drugs they're addicted to television addicted to social media uh to the extent that you're addicted you are unfree and um uh the tech giants that develop social media um figured out there are algorithms that elicit a an essentially addictive compulsive response to social media engagement like they deliberately figured out the math of how to addict people to their iphones right to social media that addiction has relate has resulted in they've clearly correlated depression and anxiety and suicide in teenagers particularly teenage girls starting with the advent of facebook in i believe it was 2012 right they watched the line shoot upwards with the use of social media it was it's an algorithm that has killed people right young people it had they they have blood on their hands because of this algorithm and so one of the things i don't want to do is find i would be just as addicted to that stuff as anybody else right i mean i i mean i you know we all have a potentially addictive personality and i don't want to be that guy walking down the street completely um submerged in an environment which is designed to addict me further and further uh and then monetize my addiction right i mean i'd like thank you no like i'll i'll just go walk down the street on my own and i'll check my email when i get back home and all the other stuff that the iphone offers and again it's a little minor miracle you have all of human knowledge you know at your fingertips i'm not sure i want all of human knowledge in my pocket if it gets all human knowledge at my desk is an amazing thing in my pocket maybe not you know do i need google maps to get from here to there no i don't right i know the sun rises in the east i can put a map in my back pocket like i can figure it out thank you do i need to you know whatever can't you know get a car you know a ride you know you know an uber with my iphone yeah that would be convenient but i can also stick a stick up my arm and get a taxi there are workarounds for all the stuff that the iphone offers you and you avoid the enormous downside of compulsive addictive behavior and all the anxiety and depression that that statistically gives rise to does your wife have a smartphone she does and i mean obviously you respect her decision and she respects yours um do you feel that there are some people who are just able to utilize it for the benefits and not succumb to the challenges and do you are you are you simply taking a cautionary approach in your own in your own life yeah i mean she's very deliberately and consciously particularly around the girls does not does not do that behavior that sort of obsessive behavior i mean the weird thing about email and texting i mean for most of you in most of your life if you have something to do a chore to do shovel that pile the dirt over there the more you shovel the less work is left the weird thing about email is that the more you do the more you have to do the the greek myth of sisyphus right the never-ending task that's email right the harder you work at it the more email you generate back at you that you then try to do as quickly as possible which generates more and you know it's it will you know it's going to kill you and my wife doesn't do that right i mean she just half the time she leaves the house and she doesn't even have her iphone because she forgot it like i mean she's she's she uses it in the way that i think you know in an extremely healthy way and she she is very very careful not to exhibit those behaviors and but i'll tell you what my little girl i mean my little girl has had virtually no screen time in her entire life she doesn't have a tablet like we do not own a television uh she when we take a long drive somewhere she gets bored she looks out the window she whistles she sings she goes to sleep she did she does what we people of our generation or my generation did when we were young is we got bored and we learned to entertain ourselves uh with little stories in our mind or what have you and that's how she my daughter deals with it so um she has a completely screen free existence and but if you give her an iphone the first thing she does is get it to get addicted to it right she starts i don't know how i mean she's four how did she learn this like this the i mean the design is so intuitive that even an uninitiated three-year-old can learn it within minutes and then the only thing she wants to do is play with that phone right so that to me is like oh they knew what they were doing it worked they figured it out they hooked a three-year-old within minutes if that's not evil what is right so you know we don't even let her near that thing how much of your philosophy around you know having your kids sleep with you not having a smartphone et cetera how much of that do you think is influenced by your time in combat so as a thought experiment let's go back to 1985 um you ultimately decide you know i want to be a lawyer you go to law school you're so you're living in you know lower east side right now you're working for a law firm everything else is the same about you you've married the same woman you have the same kids again it's a silly thought experiment yeah yeah do you think you carry a smartphone and and think of it less through the lens of well as a lawyer it might be expected that i need to have my phone on me 24 7. it's less through that lens and more through the philosophical lens i'm asking this question so if i were young i mean i think it's more a cultural thing like if i were young if i were 25 and came of age when all this stuff was normal i you know i would i mean i would probably have one of them right you know i mean i think you're younger younger than me i'm 59 right so but what i didn't do was and adopt it in midlife and there was something about the behaviors of people with iphones that i just thought i don't want to look like that right i mean occasionally i smoke a cigarette right one of these i don't you know and i see smokers standing you know furtively outside you know you know doorways in midtown smoking their their noon cigarette and even though i and can enjoy a cigarette there's something about the addictive the visuals of that addiction that's so mortifying right i'm like i don't want to be that person right that's how i feel about the iphone so i think it's more i don't it's not combat right uh you know i studied anthropology i see that through that human life through that lens i think about what are um healthy human behaviors um i married a like-minded person a like-minded woman so fortunately she and i see absolutely eye-to-eye about that stuff i have the reinforcement of other like-minded people there's a wonderful website called evolutionary parenting www.evolutionaryparenting that basically walks you through how to raise your child in an evolutionarily consistent way in modern society like taking into account the obvious sort of context of all this how can you keep uh you know within sort of normal sensible norms how can you keep your parenting within a certain way that's sort of evolutionarily healthy and consistent what do they say about food for example i i think this would be i mean there's the obvious right don't feed them things that you know are pure crap but do they talk anything else about food and eating and rituals and things like that you know they they might i mean they're more is our behavior behavior thing and you know children are not out to foil your your your your your training right they're not out to foil your plans like when when three-year-olds have temper tantrums they're not being quote bad right it's part of a process of neurological development that they have to go through and when you um uh when you pathologize normal developmental stages and normal child behavior like crying when you stick them in a dark room when you pathologize that they're doing something that they're evolutionarily wired to do they're moving through neurological stages development stages in in a normal and healthy way and you and when you pathologize it because it makes your life inconvenient um you know eventually they will learn norms that abide by your preferences but that doesn't mean it's good for them it means it's convenient for you and so what the what this website does is talk about those norms and get you to understand those behaviors um in in sort of evolutionary terms so the you know my daughter she you know every time she sees a sparkly glittery object she wants it you can't walk through the damn pharmacy without her saying i want that i want that i want that is she an abnormally materialistic acquisitive girl no she's exhibiting absolutely healthy hunter-gatherer norms about acquisition of appealing things right and and so when you you don't want to pathologize it you don't want to get her everything either but but you have to put it in a proper evolutionary context in order to have patience with it and that's what this website does i i cannot wait to check that out actually um you've alluded to it briefly in our discussion um and i've heard you speak about it before but you recently had um a very near-death experience um tell me a little bit about that yeah and you as a doctor will know what these numbers mean um uh so i had um i have an anatomical sort of anomaly in my abdomen my celiac artery has been compressed by my median arcuate ligament which is in the wrong place and it's completely occluded the celiac artery so the blood was forced to flow throughout my entire lifetime uh it was not asymptomatic in me uh the blood was forced to flow through smaller sort of sub arteries that feed the pancreas and the duodenum and i guess other digestive organs and those little artery those arteries are smaller and not designed to take the full blood flow that the celiac carries and over the course of presumably many years i hope it was a long time because i don't want this to happen again one of the arteries in the pancreatic duodenal artery one of the little arteries developed an aneurysm and then for about six months i had this really awful pain in my upper abdomen um that came and went and just being a stupid guy i never went to the doctor i'm like if it's if you can bear the pain it's probably not going to kill you what was the pain like it would come and go and it was a kind of searing cramping slightly nauseous pain and it was i i've been told that abdominal aneurysms can cause pain and there's a big nerve center right around the solar plexus and i you know i think maybe he was pushing on that but you know it wasn't the pain of kidney stones but it was way more than indigestion right i mean it was you know i would sit down and have to wait it out when it happened it was pretty awful and what was the frequency of that um i don't know every couple of days once a day something like that it would come and go last half an hour an hour and then it would um and then after some months of that i had a lot of other health problems i was just important i had sudden onset severe adult allergies for some reason um no idea why uh i uh i just i i've always always been a big runner and i had trouble running i mean just something was wrong with me right and uh i couldn't figure it out and then after some months of that the pain suddenly went away and the allergies suddenly went away like overnight i was like oh great i'm good right and then within a few weeks one afternoon i had a dr i had a dream i had a horrible nightmare that i died and i was in you know it was about six in the morning i'm in bed with my family and everyone's asleep and i had a dream that i died by some accident it was an oversight it was stupidity on my part and i died and i was looking back at my family and they were grieving and i couldn't return to them because i'd crossed over i was i was like oh you idiot you blew it and uh i woke up just like incredibly shaken and i'm not a doctor i think that my artery had already started dissecting um because the following morning i had sort of ongoing pain when i woke up in my something was wrong and i still didn't go to the doctor and that afternoon was a beautiful day and i was going to go running and i was like i'm not going to go running i don't feel quite right and within about half an hour thank god i didn't go running i would have died crawling around in the woods in about half an hour i felt this surge of pain in my abdomen i was like jesus what is that and um flooded my entire abdomen and i was like damn that is strange feeling it wasn't unbearable but it was i never had that feeling before and then within a few minutes i tried to stand up and i almost fell over my blood pressure apparently was just tanking and what had happened was the artery the aneurysm had ruptured and i was bleeding out into my abdomen and of course i didn't know this and i was in the woods with my wife and uh a little cabin that i built and um she dragged me back out of the woods uh me sort of stumbling and got me to the driveway and put me in the car so i could sit down and and i started to go blind uh the sky turned electric white and that that started to take over my entire field of vision and i was think copic i was in and out of consciousness and the paramedics got there and by the time they got there i was in something called compensatory shock and so suddenly i sort of revived i was like feeling okay and the paramedics were like you know were you good we think you dehydrated it's a hot day just sit and drink some water you'll probably feel better and i was like all right that sounds good and my wife is like you know he went blind a few minutes ago like you're taking him to the er so they took me to the er and about halfway there i and it was very far right yeah i took them an hour and a half it was an hour and a half before i got to the er right and um i lost my bowel control on the way there and i was like all right i went blind for a while and i lost my bowels like that's probably not a good sign like something's wrong and uh i got to the er and the medic who i tracked down later the guy in the back of the ambulance with me he said we got to the er and you just tanked you turned white as a sheet uh and my my hemoglobin was 1.2 and the the er doctors was like you can't i mean they i think they never said they were even compatible with life yeah it was and that's where i was at i was i they i think i had probably lost about 90 of my blood i mean i don't know i was still conscious i was in and out of consciousness iv fluid had they given you in the ambulance i just put a bag in my arm just a single bag maybe a couple bags i don't know but i got to the er and i was 1.2 my blood pressure was 60 over 40 and the doctor asked permission to cut into my neck to put a line into my neck i think it would be my carotid or my jugular i don't know jugular okay and i said i mean in case there's an emergency i had no idea i was dying and i said in case there's an emergency he was like this is the emergency right now i was like yeah you got permission so we started cutting my neck you know whatever they do and uh and then i start then that and i and basically that was when i die i started to die so my a big black pit opened up underneath me and i started to get pulled down into it and um i said to the doctor you got to hurry you're losing me right now did you say that or did you think that i said that to him i said doc you got to hurry you're losing me right now i can feel myself going and then my dead father appeared now i just want to stop and say i'm an atheist my father was a physicist i'm not religious i'm not a supernaturalist i'm not a mystic i don't believe in anything i can't measure and can't test right and my father was the same way and he appeared above me and i got a presence and he was he seemed to be welcoming me right and i wanted to have nothing to do with him and it wasn't a conversation it was a communication and he wasn't i couldn't see him i could feel him he was a presence and i was like basically not now dad like i don't want to have anything i love you but i don't have anything to do with you right now i want to you know i'm staying i want to stay here i'm nothing to do with what you know that whatever that is and how long uh earlier had your dad passed away uh nine years earlier and you were with him when he died if i recall i was holding his hand yeah um and um so you know a very spotty memory after that i remember the doctor saying to the to the um whoever was pushing me um go as fast as you can without running without actually running go as fast as you can i think was to the cath lab and uh do you remember them putting the breathing tube in your mouth i can't remember if i remember or not um i was in and out of consciousness i remember they put me in a cat scan right and they get and they had to um uh they had they had to shave me they they put a line in my groin right uh and uh i wanted to joke with them i was like i was i almost said i'm sorry i forgot to shave down there this morning right i was trying to make him laugh for some reason i don't know like a very wacky like sensibility and uh and they put a line in my groin and they put and i think they had trouble seeing where the bleed was because i had so much blood i've been bleeding into my abdomen for an hour and a half right and um luckily i'm a long distance runner i got a good heart i mean the doctor said if you weren't in really top shape you would have just died you would have died you would have gone into cardiac arrest and your kidneys would have failed and it would have been over and it took them another eight hours to find the leak i mean i was on the fluoroscope for so long that i got radiation burns on my back two weeks later the square red patch appeared on my back because i had so much radiation and i remember at one point the doctors looking at each other like i know this kind of thing is very hard to fix and it was in the middle of the night in a small hospital on cape cod hyannis hospital and i remember the doctors looking at each other and literally are like what do we do like we can't find it like what do we do and i remember thinking oh guys tell me you don't tell me i just didn't see that exchange and uh but they they were heroes man they pulled it off they finally found it and they they embolized it with catheter embolism and they gave me 10 units of blood i wound up getting 10 units of blood and they saved my life how long were you in the icu uh five days do you remember much of that oh yeah i woke up the next morning and i had no idea that i'd almost died and uh the nurse came in and um experienced nurse you know in their 50s or 60s maybe even and uh and she said listen you almost died yesterday you're you are the luckiest guy we any of us know like you should we can't believe you survived that like and uh um i was horrified you know i have these two little girls and i was absolutely traumatized by that news i had no idea i almost died and i thought about it i sat there i was throwing up blood pretty regularly i don't know how the blood got in my stomach but it did and um and and uh she came back an hour later and said hey how are you doing i said i lied i was like yeah i'm doing okay physically but honestly i'm not struggling with what you told me it's terrifying that you can almost die in your own in front of your family in your own driveway when you're a very healthy person on a nice june day like are you kidding that can happen like i don't have heart problems i don't have anything like you can just you can the universe can just take you out and uh i was like totally traumatized by that and she said try thinking about that as a sacred experience rather than a scary experience and then she walked out of the room and i've been thinking about that my whole life like yeah i was given a glimpse of the mystery you know the great mystery of death and i was given a i was allowed to look at it and allowed to survive the look at it and i got brought back and then i started to do some research i mean first of all i can't tell you how traumatizing that whole thing was combat's nothing compared to that that really messed me up and um this was june of 19 or 20. june of 20. and um i know i just got paranoid that i could that that could happen at any moment anywhere had i been on an airplane i would have died had been a walk in the woods i would have died and i'd been almost anywhere but where i was i would have died and i got maybe super paranoid it was extremely traumatic at least combat you can leave behind and you come home and you're not gonna you know and um i uh i started to look into near-death experiences by people and you know imagine my surprise that an awful lot of people see the black pit a lot of awful lot of people have dead relatives you know at the threshold to engage with them and it really got me sort of interested in what the hell you know what is this like are we really sure and i know this is going to sound completely flaky but it really aroused my curiosity about this consistency of experience across many different societies many different kinds of people and and and irreproducible through um you know low low blood oxygen ketamine endogenous dmt all the things that happen in the dying brain if you reproduce those things artificially people don't have the near-death experiences um you have to you seem to have to be kind of dying to have them and it may be real it really made me start to wonder wow like maybe it isn't just nothing like maybe there is some other dimension that's some kind of existence continues on that we just don't understand or even don't even have brains developed enough to capable of understanding it maybe it's possible and i know there's been some research in quantum physics trying to understand a possible post-death existence in terms of quantum physics and quantum fluctuation and all that stuff i mean these are people who are a lot smarter than me and i you know i don't know if i'd even understand it but it did get me sort of intrigued in an empirical sense of like do we actually are we actually completely sure that there's nothing because that not that's not what the experience that might it's not what my experience of it was you've obviously read about other people's experiences have you spoken with other people who have experienced this uh not face to face literally spoken i've had some you know i've talked about this on some podcasts and people have reached out you know via facebook or whatever social media that i do have on my laptop uh and you know with messages about yeah something like that happened to me and i had the exact same experience or a similar one you know so i have had some um affirmation not only of the mystery of it uh but of the trauma of it have you spoken with any neuroscientists about it i mean i'm curious what sort of biological explanations could exist for this well i've read some papers on it i haven't spoken to neuroscientists but i've read some papers by um doctors and medical researchers and possibly neuroscientists sort of trying to explain the phenomenon in terms of neural chemistry right and so there is a you can give ketamine is released in the dying brain you can give someone ketamine and they'll have all kinds of visions and all kinds of stuff they won't necessarily see their dead father right you can deprive someone of oxygen so that the the blood blood blood levels of oxygen are very low they don't necessarily have the experience of the dying person um there's something called dmt i think it's akin to ecstasy the drug ecstasy well that's mdma do you do you mean dmt or mdma i'm sorry i'm sorry dma i'm sorry okay yeah yeah mdma i'm not actually now i can't remember you're right i'm i'm i i actually can't remember it's one of one of the two but there's an endogenous compound that is also a drug that can be that is released in the dying brain and so you step in if you know which it is now i can't remember um but again it doesn't produce that some of the hallmark experiences of of near death so there is an ongoing mystery about exactly what this is and not you know it may be it could be the situation right it could be that those chemicals alone are insufficient to elicit that response they have to be combined with the belief that you're dying right maybe that's the well here's the thing i had no idea i was dying and um and i'm guessing a lot of dying people don't realize they're dying i mean i don't know but i'm guessing uh by the time you're dying your brain is so fuzzy and addled that you may not even be able to be understanding of it i mean um and depending on the kind of death of course but i had no idea i mean the doc the guy wanted to cut into my neck and and i was like you mean in case there's an emergency like why would you do that like i had no idea so you're in the ic for five days you're in the hospital presumably for another few days how long until you were back home i think i came home in the seventh day and what was your recovery like physically i mean i had a huge hematoma in my abdomen so i had a huge amount of dead blood and uh you know it took months for my body to process that i mean pretty quickly i was walking and then running and you know my physical activity was really constrained by my paranoia my medical paranoia you know i mean i mean uh i was like god maybe i should rent an apartment next to the hospital you know i mean not literally but i sort of joked about it with my wife like it made i mean i you know that i survived an hour and a half like that was a miracle like i just didn't want to do anything that might make it hard for a you know an ambulance crew to get to me so i definitely wasn't going to go running in the woods and all these things that are have been part of my life my whole life like they were suddenly they were terrifying to me i became someone i didn't recognize i mean it became an incredibly for a while an incredibly neurotic fearful person what chipped away at that i'm still dealing with it frankly you know and if i didn't have daughters a family i might be less worried about it but i you know i i don't want to go to africa with my family and like expire on a trans atlantic flight next to my kids you know like and you know i'm so i need to make sure i you know i'm in the process of making sure that this kind of thing um certainly or almost certainly can happen with any of the other small arteries and i'm in the process of like nailing that down but um uh you know as with combat trauma the passage of time helps um but it really changed me and i think might have changed me forever uh i think my fear i think i'm not sure that fear is going to entirely go away like there are certain loud noises i just still jump at because they sound like gunshots i'm not sure that's ever going away have you been able to sort of um incorporate the wisdom from that nurse yeah i've been working at it um you know an anthropologist friend of mine said that's you know you had a classic shamanic journey i mean the shaman goes to the sort of threshold of death encounters the after world and comes back with some information you your whole life has got have gone to places of death places where death is happening to people it might happen to you and you you know war zones and you come back and you have some information for people and so maybe you can look at this journey and i hate that word journey because it's you know sort of misused sometimes but you know if you s if you look at it as a kind of journalistic journey what information are you coming back with that might be useful to other people and to yourself and that that i'm working on and i'm going to write a book called pulse about what happened to me physically but also what the consequences were psychologically and what the possibilities are metaphysically um i want to talk to a quantum physicist about quantum fluctuation and the enduring you know the possible enduring nature of the soul you know et cetera and i just want to not to con not to confirm i mean none of this is possible to prove but i would like to walk through the possibilities to see what might be the explanation for my experience when you think about the ptsd associated with this particular event does it manifest more with depression or more with anxiety anxiety anxiety for sure was that also true of the combat ptsd uh it was until tim got killed and um then uh and i i was it was i was in my first marriage and i've talked about this before so it's i um you know we lost a uh uh we lost a pregnancy um and we found out right when right when tim was killed and the timing was weird enough that it was pretty complicated psychologically for me and um that actually that for the first time in my life sent me into a um like a real depression like a dangerous depression and i i felt removed completely removed and isolated from every person i loved including my wife at the time like i felt like i was living behind bulletproof bulletproof plexiglass and couldn't escape and um it was it was a dangerous dangerous feeling and um you know i've uh i've i've i figured it out but it was a it was a very very unpleasant time in my life what do you think was the most important factor or factors that that helped you emerge from that boy that's a good question i mean i was talking to somebody you know a professional about it that helped um i uh i was married to someone i really loved but the marriage wasn't working and eventually we both sort of like confronted that and acknowledged it and we ended the marriage and that was very painful but it felt like a healthy step we're still friends you know we did it you know why it wasn't it wasn't the wares didn't work but the divorce did you know what i mean like we we um and um i stopped uh i i'd started drinking a little more than i probably should have i mean i've never you know by no means was an alcoholic but i i had a unhealthy relationship with alcohol and i i stopped drinking uh i had atrial fibrillation which is a arrhythmia in my heart and i was told you know i fixed that i had a an abolition that fixed it completely um but um the doctor said you know you know alcohol can trigger try not drinking and i didn't drink for a month and i felt so good like that i'd like sort of turn the corner and all of a sudden i was starting to feel like a healthy person emotionally healthy person there's a lot of it's a lot of different things a lot of different things how much did other people outside of the therapist how much did other people contribute to the improvement in your well-being again i'm thinking about kind of the tribe right who was your tribe at that point in life you'd obviously lost a very important member of your tribe if i'm doing the math correctly you would go on to lose another important member of the tribe being your father um uh so who who are the important members of your of your tribe and is it necessary that they understand what you've been through right so can people who didn't know tim or who have not been in combat be a part of your healing so i i i met someone else and remarried and she had been through some pretty tough things herself um not combat obviously uh not obviously it could have been but it wasn't uh um and there was something about her compassion and understanding um that was enormously helpful to me um that was that was really quite profound and um i mean the problem with depression i mean the problem with anxiety is it doesn't make sense right you're actually you know you're anxious about something that isn't rational so being told rationally you don't have to worry about this you're not going to get an another arterial rupture it never it's not going to happen statistically you're fine you have to deal with the emotional you have to the anxiety isn't necessarily tied to reality well likewise with depression like you can be very depressed and the the fraternity of other people the love of other people might not reach you because the nature of depression is that you're at the bottom of the ocean right i mean you're you're like you can't reach me i know you're talking to me i know you love me i see your lips moving but you don't understand where i am you can't reach me here right and so i i mean that's the you know i think one of the biggest things that helps some someone in that those circumstances is feeling needed and feeling useful and being asked to contribute like look bro you might be depressed but we need you to stand guard duty for a while or you need to kill that elk or you know we need some sandbags the river's rising like you people when people are needed by the group they click into this thing that actually improves their own psychological state of mind i mean the admissions to psych wards in london during the blitz went down went down during the blitz during the bombings did depression post 9 11 suicide went down post 9 11 that's right so the the crisis engenders is a kind of call to action which gets allows people to be to buffer themselves from their psychological troubles and um you know i think that the love of one person sometimes is quite painful to experience because you realize that that person who loves you can't reach you where you are right and um but me being needed is a different thing and and you know i think ultimately that's that sense of being necessary might be the ultimate antidote to the experience of depression you know i remember really um i've always been very fascinated by the opioid epidemic and i r so so i was very attuned to how much of a problem it was you know years and years ago and i remember really naively thinking as the pandemic took hold in late march early april of 2020 i wonder if this is a crisis that will make people better i wonder if this is a crisis that will improve the collective state of our emotional health in the way that previous crises had you alluded to them right the the great depression world war ii 911 and of course the answer turned out to be no right for most people or at least on average the answer was not yes at least as it's been borne out by statistics in terms of the rates of accidental overdoses which saw an enormous increase in fact overtook all other forms of accidental deaths so it it exceeded that of car accidents in the age demographic where car accidents had historically been the leading cause of of death and it wasn't just because people weren't driving right it was due to the surge in overdoses um was i just sort of really naive to think that like that that that could possibly have the opposite effect is it obvious to you now why is it the isolation of the pandemic that is almost assuredly what fueled that or how why was that not a crisis that that that did yeah that did better i think a couple of reasons you know first of all the the what we were asked to do to protect the nation was to isolate from each other right because it was a pandemic and the humans in a crisis want to come together physically come together like within proximity physical touching of each other like that's what p that's what makes people feel safe and again that's why children feel safe when they sleep with their when their parents they can touch their parents like they feel them and that reduces their anxiety and they sleep very deeply right and they'll get a good night's sleep and so will the parents if they're not stuck in a dark room well likewise when you're scared if you're facing a crisis the proximity of others it raises oxytocin levels he raises testosterone levels of men it does all kinds of good things that allow the group to deal with the crisis um this was a crisis that did the opposite it alienated people it isolated people and isolation we know is very often leads to depression and you know just ask someone who's not a weak in solitary confinement at a federal penitentiary what the effects of isolation are right i mean that's where they'd rather be you know they'd rather be like electrocuted right they'd rather be have their meals taken away anything right then then just please don't stick me in a hole by myself the hardest thing for humans and that's basically what we were asked to do and understandably it was a pandemic but the other thing is that there was no unity of purpose the political leadership uh was completely contradictory about what it meant to be a good american and so on the one hand you had people knowledgeable people saying being a good american means wearing a mask and social distancing and eventually getting your vaccine right and then you had political leadership that was like you know what um no it actually means not wearing a mask and not social distancing and not getting a vaccine and so that the discordant contradictory messages from the upper upper echelons of our society i think made people crazy right there was no way to feel like oh i'm saving aluminum cans i'm going to give them to you know like once a week i'm going to take them down to the you know the scrap metal drive in my little town because the troops overseas need the metal like there was no unity of purpose there because we were being told completely contradictory things by the political leadership yeah and and i suspect well it's interesting right the depression there wasn't an external enemy in the way that there was in world war ii or post 911 and yet that unity could still exist suggesting that even an infectious agent though not an enemy per se it's hard to be angry at a virus if handled correctly potentially could have been more at least less damaging i don't want to say more unifying given the isolation you know requirements at the time but um could have been less destructive i suppose had donald trump um come out and said it's your patriotic duty to wear a mask in a social distance and you know what if you get the vaccine i know maybe you're worried about it maybe you're scared of it if you get the vaccine you're a damn hero to this country you know what i mean like most of the country would have done it and unfortunately i don't know what his calculus was but unfortunately he didn't choose to do that even though um he sort of mumbled at one point that you should wear a mask and he got himself a vaccine right i'm sure the whole white house staff did is did all fox news and all of cnn you know like everybody got the vaccine but the split messaging from that side of the american political um environment uh was enormously confusing and um i mean i happen to be a democrat i enormously respect elements of the the conservative political ideal i get it i don't share it but i get it i respect it um that that that kind of that kind of thing was really um incredible i found incredibly selfish and unbelievably anti-american unpatriotic for the trump administration to engage in that stuff not to make this a political question although it sounds like it coming on the heels of that were were we're literally on the heels of of the withdrawal from afghanistan i just mentioned i came back from a hunt and a number of the guys i hunt with are formal former special forces guys and a lot of the time around the camp was was kind of talking about their experiences in afghanistan and their views on the us withdrawal um i've received a number of questions from people on social media who knew i was going to be interviewing you wanting your thoughts on the the the manner of the withdrawal and um whether it was necessary at all in the first place uh so for example a lot of the the seals i spoke with were adamant that this was not something that should have happened right that this was no longer actually a war it was really more of a peacekeeping operation and 5 000 troops could have stayed there indefinitely and kept the taliban at bay um and still would have been a fraction of the number of troops that we have in germany for example or south korea or any number of the um you know geographies of our allies what are your thoughts on that i would agree agree with your your friends who said that um it was i mean there's 40 000 cops in new york city right i think when we finally withdrew the last troops it was down to a couple thousand twenty five hundred yeah yeah 2500 u.s and then including nato you can round up a bit maybe call it five thousand i think is what i read so their ability to carry out targeted strikes to carry out airstrikes um just the sort of safety tripwire of american forces in afghanistan would have essentially guaranteed that the taliban could not overrun the rest of the country and um i think the cause you know at minimal cost in lives and and and treasure if if any i mean they you know the taliban had not attacked american forces since february of 2020 right not a single american casualty since right now maybe that's because they knew that we we the trump administration had negotiated a withdrawal and they knew we don't want to mess this up or just sit tight so they i mean it's possible i don't know maybe if we decided to stay it would have changed but um i think we could have maintained troops there at minimal costs to this nation and at enormous benefit to the to the afghan people um our big error there in my opinion i wrote a piece for vanity fair about this recently a few weeks ago um the reason the taliban were allowed in by the afghan populist was that they promised to clean up corruption and they pretty much did um you know abusive you know abuse at the police checkpoints where you have to bribe the policemen to get through with your family every time you file a you know a piece of paper with the government you got to bribe the clerk that's you know whatever that kind of awful endemic corruption that makes the lives of of ordinary afghans ordinary people absolutely miserable and enriches at the top of the food chain makes these you know warlords and and government ministers like obscenely wealthy the taliban clean that up and our big mistake was that we stood up a government in afghanistan that was incredibly corrupt we never insisted on any kind of accountability for the money we pumped in there we pumped money in that we knew was going to these warlords just enriching them to govern corrupt governors and all that it was an enormously abusive system and uh we didn't care and we gave them the kind of government that afghans don't want and that afghan soldiers understandably are not willing to die for we did it to ourselves we didn't need to do that we could have insisted on some accountability um but we didn't do it and it wasn't the military it was the state department that was not interested in pursuing uh the military would have done whatever they were ordered and if the orders came down look you gotta track every penny and make sure it's not getting abused um the military would have done that as much as as much as they were capable of so uh you know i think there's it's tragic that that happens and uh i think in the end in the end if we weren't going to insist on a decent government what's the point of staying forever anyway like that you can't ask anyone to die for a corrupt system and that's what we would have been asking american soldiers to do which begs the question why did we allow a corrupt system uh to to blossom under our watch when we had all held all the trump cards and could have forced that government to actually act uh act ethically and why do you think we didn't i don't know i you know i don't know i brought it up with john kerry in 2000 2010 he asked for a meeting with me and he the war wasn't going well and i was like the war is never going to go well until you address the corruption issue because afghans are never going to fight for this government you've given them and he was like well we can't do that you know like we have no leverage here i was like what are you talking about threatened to threaten to leave afghanistan like the last time the taliban took over they hung the president najibola from a street lamp for corruption right every government every corrupt government minister knows that if we pull out they're all hanging from street lamps right you have a huge amount of leverage and they just they wouldn't do it it was too much of a hassle i can't believe we haven't even talked about your last book i feel like we need to spend a few minutes on it because i find it just fascinating so um yet i hate doing kind of forced rushed quick stuff so we'll take as much time as you want to take tell me when you took this journey i i uh so i walked along the railroad lines from washington dc to philadelphia to pittsburgh we were basically we we called it high speed vagrancy uh we were you know railroad lines or there's kind of a swath of no man's land that goes right through america right right through the ghettos and the suburbs and the farms and the industries and the junkyards and everything and and it's and it's no man's land and you can do whatever you want and as long as the cops don't catch you and so we had this interesting 400 mile game of um hide and seek with the cops and we were sleeping under bridges and abandoned buildings and getting our water out of creeks and uh and most nights as i say in my book most nights we were the only people who knew where we were and there's many definitions of freedom but surely that's one of them and so that was you know ten eight years ago that i did that trip with with three other guys that had been in a lot of combat and uh um and then later you know a few years ago i decided i wanted to write a book about freedom and for me the word freedom the the thing i wanted to understand about it is that we're the only species where a smaller individual or a smaller group can out-fight a larger individual or a larger group and when you talk about freedom basically it means an underdog an underdog group maintaining their autonomy in the face of a greater power how does that work i mean the montenegrins in the early 1600s were outnumbered 12 to 1 when the ottoman empire invaded their mountain domain outnumbered 12 to 1 and every time the ottomans came in the montenegrins destroyed them right there's no mammal where that could be true of only humans and so i organized my thoughts into three sections in my book run fight and think and those are basically the three ways that humans maintain their autonomy they outrun their repressors if they can't like the apache did the apache remained autonomous for centuries while their sedentary wealthier pueblo neighbors got rolled by the spanish immediately the apache remained free some elements of them until 1886 that's almost almost within my grandmother's lifetime they did that by being mobile if you can't outrun your repressor you're going to have to out fight them and the ability of small human groups to defeat on the battlefield much more powerful adversaries like the taliban defeated the united states and the russians before them before us and the in the english before that um is unique to the human species um and i looked at mma and some of the individual martial arts to look at the dynamics of combat to understand how smaller individuals can also defeat larger ones you know one of the way one of the reasons that happens is that big muscles require a lot of oxygen and if you throw 20 punches in a row and you're a big guy and you don't connect you're you're out of breath at the end of that and small muscles small frames use less oxygen and are more reactive and more efficient and so if you can if you're as a smaller fighter if you can slip 20 punches you're not in oxygen debt the big guy is right and that's essentially what the taliban did with you the u.s on a sort of macro scale uh massive armies go through enormous amount of resources that insurgencies don't and after 20 years we basically ran out of resources in the will the will to spend them um but for the final chapter is called think um and it's about how you maintain your autonomy within your society so the first thing you have to do is repel the enemy outrun or out fight the enemy but the bro the problem in human history is that a community a society that's well enough organized to out fight an enemy is is well enough organized to oppress their own people so fascist dictators throughout history totalitarian states they are very militaristic societies that are well armed to repel invaders but they also use that military organization um to uh to oppress their own society and control it um and so i look at how societies can maintain their freedom from within from an oppressor that is of their own people an oppressive leader and i looked at the labor movement in america around 100 years ago and you know basically the the brilliance of of the human species is that we can out-think more powerful entities and the labor movement was able to um eventually get their way in the face of you know the national guard with fixed bayonets and the entire us government they eventually got their way and in terms of fair pay and fair work hours fair work conditions um and the tipping point often is having well first of all you need selfless leaders you are you need leaders if you're going to overthrow the british in dublin in ireland in 1916 if you're going to confront the u.s government as a as a labor union uh as a as a as a labor uprising you're going to lead leaders who are willing to die for the cause they cannot tell everyone else to rush the machine guns while they stay hiding behind the sandbags if you don't have leaders that are willing to die you will as an underdog group you will not win right but likewise you need women like social you know social movements like that political movements insurgencies that don't incorporate women into uh into their power structure and into their strategy and their tactics i will probably not succeed and so i i looked at the again at the mill strikes in america and um the the turning point came when the strikers in lawrence massachusetts started putting women on the front lines to confront the national guard soldiers with uh with fixed bayonets and the soldiers didn't know what to do they were not willing to bayonet women and um and uh they had mothers they had sisters you know they had wives they weren't willing to do it and whereas killing men is morally much less of a problem even for totalitarian regimes and certainly for democracies and uh so when you put women into the equation the police don't quite know what to do right and as one frustrated policeman said at the time he said one cop can handle 10 men but it takes 10 cops to handle one woman and that was the beginning of the end for um the resistance to these crucial changes that came to the uh textile industry in you know 1912 1914 did the taliban ever use women obviously they're from a sharia law standpoint not exactly uh sensitive to women but did they ever use women in the true sense of the word use for their for their gains no and you know here's the thing is that on the battlefield particularly at the distances that are typical of modern combat i mean you know automatic weapons easily fire two three four hundred meters um you don't you don't see the faces of the people you're fighting you certainly don't know what sex they are you don't the the women's capabilities really come to the fore in a um the kinds of insurgencies that they had for example for the battle of algiers when the french were occupying algiers and morocco in the 1950s and 1960s so or the mill strikes in massachusetts women have lateral networks right they're not good at top-down hierarchies men are good at top-down hierarchies and the top guy says all right now we're going to charge the machine guns and men will do it right and women's their forte is not that so much as lateral networks lateral egalitarian networks they're unranked but they're lateral and it's very hard for information the the intelligence agencies to penetrate those networks and so basically an insurgency depends on the society from which it springs to fight right so the taliban are exclusively male fighters but if they are not part of a society that incorporates women and women are absolutely crucial to any functioning society if you don't incorporate that it's not going to go very far and you know the easter rising in ireland is another excellent example of that if you literally have women on the front lines it doesn't matter so much in in in open combat because you often don't you know it's a lot of it's spray and prey tactics anyway you're just unloading a belted machine gun um when you're when you're operating in a situation like the mill strikes in lawrence these are society face to face with itself and there is some public accountability to murdering women with bayonets given now that the taliban will likely be carrying out their actions in you know not at 400 meters what do you think is going to be the the natural history of how things go in afghanistan well you know it takes a very different temperament a very different mindset um to be to be a successful insurgent insurgency than to run a run a country to run a government right completely different mindsets and you know i think i mentioned i heard that the taliban fighters are now bored right i mean they missed the war right so the taliban their brilliant insurgency brilliant strategic thinkers they out fought the most powerful military ever in human history outfit they outlasted them they outlasted our will to fight right um now they have to run afghanistan it's twice the population it was in 1996 when i saw them take power back then um it's the cities have been modernized a generation of afghans have received education afghan girls have received an education that's an unwieldy that's gonna they're gonna find afghanistan stand to be an unwieldy mess that is very very hard to run and run according to sharia law and uh so i don't know what the future holds but i imagine that there's going to be some fracturing within the taliban really hardcore ultra sort of like conservative elements falling out with more moderate elements that want engagement with the west i imagine that kind of fracturing will happen uh the tajik resistance is organizing itself in masood's old territory in barakshan uh in the northeast quadrant of the country um if they don't abide by some basic international human rights norms they're going to have a very very hard time actually accessing international donations international monetary systems international relief efforts and recognition by foreign governments i mean do you really think that's true i mean that might be true of western governments do you do you think china will care especially i mean some of them might not but um the west is important i mean the original taliban was recognized by the uae pakistan and one other country i can't remember saudi maybe i can't remember um so you know there's eight eight billion dollars of afghan money is sitting in new york banks and i think will not be released without uh some some kind of legitimacy to the to the afghan government um they have the taliban have a world of world of hurt ahead of them you know they might they may make it work but it's not going to be the simple prospect that it was in 1996 when all these cities were rubble and and the population was half this size and no one had cell phones and whatever else like that they're they're going to have a tough hill to climb how long did it take you to go on your uh your journey your walk uh we walked um off and on uh from for a year and then i kept doing it a little bit after you know after that uh from time to time with one or two buddies so um we called it the last patrol and um i would still love to get out there was it hbo that did the uh where does that documentary appear yeah i brought a videographer who quickly became part of the group and uh you know it was the last patrol was was aired on hbo in 2015 i think but after we stopped shooting we kept some of us kept going back out there we i really liked it out there in the railroad lines when did you know you were done i was headed for a place called jumbo ville glen where the french and indian wars basically started a young george washington in 1754 led an expedition small expedition against a french force reconnaissance force and his sort of native uh native tracker and scout a seneca named tenegrissan uh the half known as the half king he precipitated a massacre of some of the french soldiers who surrendered to washington and that triggered a reaction by the brits which went into the french indian war which eventually set the sort of set the terms for the revolutionary war without the british winning the french and indian war the seven years war we might not have america might not have dared throw off british rule with france right on their right on their on their border um so it's an iconic place that very few people have heard of and it's right outside of connellsville pennsylvania western pennsylvania and i wanted to end there i wanted to sneak into condos into uh jumalville glen it's in the woods deep in the woods so i wanted to sleep in the sneak sleep in there sneak in there and sleep there thinking that the last people that slept there under this little cliff um the last people that slept there might have been the french forces under jumaalville in 1754 and i wanted to get out of there before the you know park you know it's a national historical site and that before the park guards showed up you know i'd sneak out of there before dawn i like wanted to do that and we got to connellsville it was a very hot day and and i sort of shredded my feet it was 100 degrees during the day and when it's that hot we're carrying a lot of weight you know we're moving 10 20 miles a day we're carrying 60 70 pounds on our backs and we're sweating an awful lot and and basically your your bottoms your feet kind of turned to oatmeal basically and and uh and uh you know i was bleeding my feet were bleeding i was an enormous amount of pain and we got to connellsville and condoms was very very poor and uh as one lady said so poor that when it gets hot they don't even have pools in their backyard they just they just swim in the river that runs through the middle of the city and it's an old industrial town and indeed there they there was connellsville you know taking the you know swimming swimming at the end of the day during the scorcher of a summer day um taking the heat off and we got there we stumbled limped to the sort of rock cobble of the beach along the yokogany river and took off our boots and our shirt and staggered into the water and i came back and um i sat down and the dog was exhausted and the men were exhausted and i could barely walk we had another we're going to sleep somewhere in downtown connellsville we're going to try to hide from the police somewhere and sleep along the river and then keep moving in the morning and we had 15 miles to go to get the jumbo ville glen and i looked around at the guys and you know i was in the middle of getting divorced and i was like i was like you know what the trip just ended we don't need to go to jumulville it's over we're done we got what we needed out of this it's time to go home and face our all of us go home and face our lives and uh which is what we did so i recognized the ending when it came to me i didn't know i didn't even i didn't wake up in the morning thinking that i knew it in the moment and i think one of the great things to work on is to know in the moment when things are over trips relationships anything you got to know it so when it's over you got to know it's over and if you don't god help you i mean i hate asking a glib question because i agree with that wholeheartedly right i mean knowing when to quit is an amazing gift what are some of the signs how do you know when it's time because it's it's not always obvious in the moment no it's not you got to feel it it's got to be a feeling your instincts your feelings don't lie you know and if you just suddenly get the feeling that you're doing something because you think you're supposed to stay you know you're supposed to stay married you're supposed to go walk all the way to zuma jomovil glenn on bleeding feet like if you think you're supposed to because it's embarrassing not to that's not the right reason and i don't know how to articulate it more than that like you gotta you gotta feel it like sometimes you get an instinctive sense not to trust somebody that's a feeling it's not knowledge it's feeling and those instincts serve us very very well and um you got to pay attention to them and i felt it i was like okay why exactly are you going to jumonville glenn oh because you thought that would be a cool ending for your project your little project you know like oh the symbolism of it like you don't do things for symbolism you don't do things because they're a good ending you gotta feel what you need and what's right and what's good and and i felt that come right up to the ground into me i was like look at the dog look at the men we're all broken like you don't yeah can we do it physically yeah we can do anything we'll crawl there if we have to we could do it i was with some tough guys you know like yeah we could do it but why why are we doing if you can't answer that question um you know very very readily with conviction and with some with some feeling in your chest if you can't answer it um you don't have you don't don't do it did the guys put up uh an argument no everyone was thrilled we we knew we all knew do you think that they simultaneously knew or do you think that they had come to that conclusion earlier and didn't want to speak up uh i think i somehow convinced them that i that i knew what i was doing and they kind of trusted my decisions and you know i might have just had a rebellion on my hands i don't know but um uh yeah they trusted me we were i mean you know we'd walked i mean we got shot at and fell in pennsylvania somebody started shooting at us just because they didn't like the looks of us you know we we we were hungry we were cold we walked through the winter how did you guys feed yourself well we'd walk into town and buy some food and keep walking out the other side and go back out onto the lines and you know we smoked a little tobacco out there and you know we were stuff we needed from town we'd stop we'd go in we looked like hell we looked homeless basically we looked like sort of high-speed homeless right and then we keep going and so a lot of stuff you know the cops were looking at for us with a helicopter like all kinds of weird crazy stuff happened and we were a unit right we i mean we were brothers like we really we we were connected and so when that moment came by the yucca gaining river i think we all felt it and it was the obvious the obvious thing to do you think back over the last 250 years of american civilization or nearly 250 years i guess um as a society when during that arc where we most free depends how you define freedom you know um i'll let you define it because i feel you're you're in a better position to do so than i am politically we're the most free now okay um obviously the the the initial democratic uh endeavor with the constitution and the bill of rights forgot to include black people right com outrageous transgression that's not a free that's not a free society um politically you know by the time you get to the civil rights movement suffrage and then the civil rights movement the labor movement by the time you start getting into the 1970s 1980s you're starting to get something at least approaching some political political freedom economic freedom is a different matter and um if you have a society where the income gap is too wide between rich and poor um it's hard to argue it's a completely free society uh people can be held in sort of a voluntary bondage of having to work three jobs because you know we all know that story right i mean like that's not a free society but then following on from that if you can't freely make choices that are good for you you're not free and if you are addicted to something right you're not entirely free and we live in a massively addicted society addicted to substances addicted to visual stimuli from television or iphones um those are not we are not free people in that sense and and uh i don't know which is worse right which is worse the uh inability to vote or the inability to look up from your iphone which is a greater form of oppression which corrodes your human dignity more i don't know it's an open question um what i will say is that i had the good fortune to interview a man who had spent some decades in prison for doing an extremely bad thing um from a very brutal diminished situation in his family and his society and it had the predictable results of violence and crime and he killed somebody and he went and he paid the price for it and he spent almost 30 years in prison educ getting educating himself he found god um i'm an atheist but i completely respect someone who finds god and he straightened himself out and he was let out on good behavior and i was able to interview this man a week after a couple weeks after he was let out of prison after 25 some whatever years at the end of the interview i said i feel i said i feel silly asking this but is it possible to be more free in prison than outside of prison and he looked at me like i was crazy he said yeah of course it is are you kidding um he said you can't be a drug addict in prison um you can't be addicted to your you don't have an iphone you can't be all distracted you look at people walking around they're not they're not free they're all chained to something right he said if you're in prison you got nothing but time and eventually eventually you're going to have an honest conversation with yourself about who you really are and what you're doing in there and when you have that conversation with yourself you're a free man no matter where you are and there's a lot of people on the outside and by that he means outside of prison there's a lot of people on the outside who never get around to having that conversation with themselves so i i don't think you can pin down an era uh i would say our freedom right now is in in a historical context is breathtaking um in its depth um but with some very very serious worrisome caveats some very worrisome footnotes to that among them economic inequality i mean that's a that's going to bring us down boy the uh the point of view of that guy having just got out of uh prison is is staggering and i think that the um the insight is profound right i mean if you can't look at yourself if you can't examine who you are if you're too distracted by the trappings of fill in the blank how free are you where do you come out on the um the guy you you came across when you were doing the patrol who basically had if i recall he had a shovel tied around his belt and a few other possessions you he basically everything he owned was with him and you you asked the question is is he the freest guy you've seen or the least free yeah i mean i don't know i mean i don't have an answer for that i mean material possessions give you a kind of freedom um in the sense that you're not living a survival level marginal existence um but they require work and you're you know do you want to have uh freedom of maneuver you want to be able to be mobile do you want to have temporal freedom where your time is your own do you want to have economic freedom where you have a whole ton of money and you can make choices i'm going to stay at that hotel i'm going to go to do this i'm going to do that i'm not you know like what like there is no one there's there's no form of freedom like where you have it all right and so that guy we didn't talk to him i just got a glimpse of him but you know he had all of his possessions tied to the blade of a shovel a snow shovel and the snow shovel the handle was tied to the back of his pants and he was walking along sledding all of his belongings behind him and you know he clearly didn't have a job to go do in the morning and clearly was living out of dumpsters and whatever else so yeah is he free is he the ultimate free person or the ultimate oppressed person i don't know i mean i don't i don't offer answers but but some of the questions are interesting and and you know i will say you know and i might sort of end on this because i i i have to get going to pick up my kids but um sedentary society started about 10 000 years ago when we humans started to cultivate wild grains in mesopotamia and um uh what that allowed for an accumulation of wealth and it allowed for social hierarchies right the development of class leaders and lead rulers and serfs right the advantage of that system is that you could feed a 40 000 man army and defend yourselves and your riches very very easily right nothing's gonna overrun the city of war right i mean huge massive walls massive army um the disadvantage is that most people spent most of their day working and working for the pharaoh right i mean metaphorically speaking you know working for their ruler and so the nomads of that era um were materially poor like the apache were but their time was their own they were completely mobile and it was an account in egalitarian society it's hard to oppress people they can put everything they own on the back of a horse and leave in the middle of the night right hard to do so nomadic peoples have typically been materially poor and very very autonomous and very egalitarian right and i will say that for a lot of human history wealthy sedentary people have romanticized uh mobile nomadic peoples have romanticized those lives precisely because it looks and is so free even in this society we romanticize outlaws and motorcycle gangs and all those groups that we would never most of us never want to be part of but it's enormously romanticized because they're mobile and they're fairly egalitarian and that's exactly what nomads were for 10 000 years and still are and there's a very revealing quote from a group a song from a group of nomads uh called the yomut in northern iran in the vast grand grasslands around the caspian sea and the yamut were a tribal mobile pastoral nomadic society very warlike and they said of their sedentary wealthy sedentary neighbors they said i am your moot i do not have a mill with willow trees in other words i'm not a farmer i do not have a mill with willow trees i have a horse and court a court is a kind of whip i have a horse and court i will kill you and go it's the ultimate arrogance and pride of a nomadic a warlike nomadic person and so what i would say is that the enormous wealth and sedentary nature of western society has enabled us to do astounding things scientifically technologically it's allowed for the rise of democracy rule of law and the medicine that saved my life like the list is endless um but we're not the yo-mutes right there is something inherent something important to human dignity that takes place in a society that is mobile and entirely governing of its own circumstances and more or less egalitarian there is something essential to human dignity that happens in those societies that has trouble happening in this wealthy wealthy amazing industrial society that we live in and it we're not going to go back to being nomads but it might help just to take note take note of those qualities and maybe instill some of them where we can into our own society sebastian i want to thank you for um taking a lot of your time out to sit down today um and also for sharing so much of what is both
