## Description

Paul Offit is a pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases and an expert in virology and vaccine development. He currently serves on the FDA committee evaluating COVID-19 vaccines. In this episode, Paul’s second appearance on The Drive, he provides an update on all the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently deployed, explains why the concerns raised around the mRNA vaccines are not legitimate, and offers his view on the prospects and timeframe of reaching herd immunity. He also takes a deep dive into immunology, explaining the short-term and long-term immune response to both natural infection and vaccination and how these two can function together to provide durable immunity. Additionally, they discuss the theories on the origins of this virus, what impact the new COVID-19 variants might have, and the recent pausing of the J&J vaccine. Finally, they discuss how we can be better prepared for an inevitable future outbreak of a novel virus. This episode was originally recorded on April 14, 2021.

## Transcript

[00:00:01] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia

[00:00:09] hey Paul it's great to uh to have you back thank you so much for making time uh obviously at the time that we're recording this I know you're busy with some news that we'll we'll get to later but uh nevertheless it seems like it's about the right time to for us to pick up this discussion again because the last time we spoke we were just on the cusp of watching a number of vaccines uh hit that first phase of early use authorization as we stand here today I I actually can't tell you the numbers but you know tens of millions of people have been vaccinated and in some ways there are still a lot of questions um so let's start with just an update the lay of the land for people broadly speaking right four strategies for scientific strategies in place to create vaccines one of them is an mRNA vaccine which we'll talk about the second uh something that's a little more tried and true at least something that's been done a number of times before using an adenovirus to deliver DNA the third is deliver during directly purified protein of the virus and the fourth probably the oldest trick in the book is using live attenuated virus can you give us just a broad overview of where each of those four are um and and maybe what it says about the scientific challenges of the approval process for each right so so at least in the United

[00:01:34] States the messenger RNA vaccines are the farthest along we approved the FDA vaccine advisory committee approved the Pfizer messenger RNA vaccine on December 10th the moderna messenger RNA vaccine on December 17th um and and they then rolled off the assembly lines and into the arms of the American public such that now you have more than 120 million people who have received at least one dose of an mRNA containing vaccine so that's the farthest along um it's certainly in this country in terms of the adenovirus vectors the replication defective adenovirus vectors there's the replication effect of simian adenovirus Vector which is that that was put forward by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford in the UK that it's partnered with AstraZeneca and then the um the Johnson Johnson product which is Johnson that is the wholly owned uh subsidiary of Johnson Johnson and that's a replication effect of adenovirus type 26. so um the ad26 vector has been used fairly extensively to to try and slow the Ebola outbreak in West Africa so about 200 000 doses had been administered in West Africa that vaccine um now we have more than six million doses of that that's been given in the

[00:02:45] United States um and then with regard to the AstraZeneca vaccine tens of millions of dose have been given in the United Kingdom as well as uh in Europe certainly more than 20 million doses overall have been given of That vaccine um in terms of the um the purified protein vaccine the probably the the company that's the farthest along is novovax they use a baccalovirus expression system so basically you have a baklavirus into which you insert in this case the the gene the codes for the coronavirus Spike protein and that's grown up into in butterfly cells basically spadoptera fruity parasols it's the exact same way we make flu block so there's a lot of uh experience experience to make using that technology to make a vaccine those Studies have been uh largely completed but the novovax has been fairly slow to to gain any sort of approval yet to my knowledge anywhere yet live attenuated viral vaccines are not um they're still in the works I don't know of any live attenuated viral vaccine that is now being being routinely given to to Country to anybody in any country in this world but I could be wrong I I haven't heard that I know people were working a number of groups working on it then there's there's the whole kill viral vaccine which is the the product that's used by China um which has been extensively given to now again tens of millions of people which is the way that we make the polio vaccine the inactivated polio vaccine during the hepatitis A vaccine or the rabies vaccine so again a lot of experience with that product that there's some question about how effective it is I should also add that the Russian vaccine is also a replication effect of adenovirus vaccine in that case add 26 human ad 26 followed by human ad5 so those are the strategies that are currently wending their way through the world and is it safe to say Paul that the either that the whole killed is probably

[00:04:26] I actually mistakenly said that the attenuated because I tend to lump that in with whole kill but really whole killed is the first play that's really initiated uh vaccination is that kind of the oldest trick well the oldest older oldest trick is is a a live non-human virus I mean the cowpox was was the first vaccine in the late 1700s which so basically the thinking there was that that not that it was thinking at all since this was the late 1700s before we actually knew what viruses were I mean it was just phenomenology but um that that now we know that uh the cow pox virus is energetically related exactly really close enough to human smallpox that immunization with one can protect you against disease caused by the other but you're right the second strategy was the whole killed virus strategy that was 100 years later in the late 1800s in France with Louis Pasteur making the whole killed for rabies virus vaccine yeah that's right I remember my mom reading me that story when I was a little boy actually I was I could listen to that story every single night of because it had pictures of him you know taking the serum from the dog and killing the virus and giving it to the boy I can still actually see every part of that book so so you know one of the things that I hear a lot of is you know that mRNA thing is crazy this is totally sci-fi it's completely experimental why would anyone subject themselves to something that is so risky and so unproven um a little while ago I wrote something on this topic trying to make the point I don't know how convincing it was that actually it's not as experimental as people think and that this technology has been around for decades plural and that the only thing that's new is that this is the first time the final step has been made which is actually taking a you know a virus that is of concern to humans sequencing it and then you know putting it into a clinical practice but this notion of using mRNA uh has you know this didn't just come out of nowhere this wasn't something that was developed in 12 months as one might believe if they weren't really following the science too closely do you find yourself confronted with the same type of question yes and they're reasonable question yeah I think you know it's it's it is a new era of vaccinology I mean we just went through that briefly but it's arguably the Fifth

[00:06:47] Air I mean you go to initially sort of animal strains that are related to human then you go to the inactivated vaccines then you go to the lab attenuated viral vaccines um then you go to purified protein vaccines what all those four strategies have in common is that you're giving the viral protein that you're interested in

[00:07:02] I mean in this case we're interested in the source cov2 Spike protein but that and when you give that protein in one form or another whole virus or an live attenuated virus or just purified protein itself um you know you're giving that protein the viral protein then the person makes an antibody response to that protein you're not doing that here you're giving the gene that that codes for the viral

[00:07:22] Protein that's translated into cytoplasm to the viral protein so your body makes the viral protein then your body makes an antibody response and you can see why people are are concerned because it's the term that is used correctly is it's a genetic strategy you're giving a gene and the minute you say that to people that's often interpreted as something that could you know could interfere with your genes or you know re-orient or re-engineer your genes that's the way people hear that they hear it as gene therapy and in a sense it is kind of gene therapy but not uh in the more traditional way that it's meant so what is the best answer you have to someone that says look I'm not worried about acute toxicity or even sub-acute toxicity because given how many tens of millions of people have received both the modern vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine I think anybody can say unequivocally there can't be any complications in the short run that are clinically relevant I mean we just there have been too many people vaccinated to know that oh my gosh you know 0.001 percent of people are going to suffer some horrible complication but it's not necessarily clear that there can't be some really long-term complication that doesn't show up for a year or two years or three years so um and and therefore I think to your point it is a reasonable point of concern to say well this is still very new and we don't have 10 years of data the way we would if this strategy were deployed through a traditional non-emergency use approach for something like influenza where we didn't have to rush because we have so many other strategies so my question is what would you say to reassure somebody that in five years we're not going to learn something horrible about inserting coronavirus mRNA into our cells all right so there's two ways I would answer that the first is um Can the the messenger RNA in any way um alter our DNA because I think that's at the heart of what people are worried about and then that comes up later in some form or another um that's not possible for three reasons first of all when the messenger RNA is taken up by cells in everybody it's primarily something called dendritic cells which is the major kind of antigen presenting cell in your body that presents cells presents antigens to the immune system to the rest of the immune system so it's taken up it's in a lipid nanoparticle the lipid nanoparticles taken up in the cell it's stripped away and then that messenger RNA enters the ribosomal system where like the other couple hundred thousand copies of messenger RNA that are in your cytoplasm it's then translated to a protein and that happens over over days and then the messenger RNA like all message rnas breaks down and and is no longer making that protein so the question then is can the messenger RNA get into the nucleus and in any way alter the DNA which you cannot do for three reasons first of all it has to be able to cross the nuclear membrane which which requires a nuclear access signal that it doesn't have secondly even if it got into the into the nucleus it's RNA it's not DNA so in order to affect DNA it has to be converted to DNA which means which requires an enzyme like reverse transcriptase which it also doesn't have even if it was converted to DNA which it can't because it can't cross the nuclear membrane and it can't be basically reverse transcribed back to DNA it still has to insert itself into the DNA which requires an integrase enzyme that it also doesn't have so it's not possible you have a better chance of developing x-ray vision after you've gotten this than you have of the MRNA in any way altering your DNA although I never understand why people when they say that it Alters your DNA doesn't think it can alter your DNA for the good you know like making you Spider-Man for example or something like that people never talk about that so that's one one thing I think that's not possible the second thing is long-term effects I guess I would challenge we we have these discussions at the CDC a lot with people who have a lot of experience with this name that that serious adverse event that's associated with vaccines that has not been picked up within two months of getting a dose so and there are I mean you know vaccines like any medical product that have a positive effect can have a negative effect including a severe negative effect and so for example um the the um squalene adrifted influenza vaccine that was used in Europe through the 2009 pandemic one of those vaccines so-called pandemics could actually cause narcolepsy I mean it was rare it was about one per 55 000 people but it was real and it again occurred within six weeks of getting a dose the oral polio vaccine that was created by Albert Sabin to basically eliminate a polio from this country could itself cause polio it could actually revert to essentially norovirulent or wild type virus and cause polio again what happened within a few weeks of a dose the influenza vaccine is a rare cause roughly one per million and for polio is about one per 2.4 million doses but influence about one per million doses can cause

[00:12:15] Guillain-Barre syndrome which is an ascending paralysis which can be severe and occasionally fatal again occurs within six weeks of a dose the yellow fever vaccine in roughly one per million people depending on which strain you use can cause something we call viscerotropic disease which is a nice way of selling saying yellow fever I mean the yellow fever vaccine can cause yellow fever much the same way the oral polio vaccine could cause polio again within a week or so of getting the dose so so I don't know of that serious side effect that that causes long-term problems now it is true that some of these most of these side effects all these side effects are so rare that when they occur they only occur when they're in tens of millions of people and then you can see that but but that's why for every vaccine you you know you have to wait for two months after the second or those or whatever the last dose is to make sure it's still safe and that was true of all these vaccines going out I mean we're going to get to the issue I think later in this broadcast with

[00:13:07] Johnson Johnson vaccines but again that that issue came up within two weeks of a dose yeah I I just want to make sure that for the for the listener we really highlight the Salient Point here which I think is actually the first point that you made because I do think that for most people who are I think hearing a lot of misinformation um it's coming through the channels of people who don't really understand enough biology to to sort of explain exactly how messenger RNA is translated into protein and of course that's what we want here and how we don't have any of the Machinery to enable the reverse um let's talk a little bit about HIV as a virus because HIV actually can undergo some of this process um so so maybe use HIV as uh as a

[00:14:02] Counterpoint and also let's dovetail that into how failed attempts to create a virus for HIV a pardon me to create a vaccine for HIV why why is that not possible and how what has that taught us about the current strategy here a lot packed into that question I realized yeah I would say if I had to pick what I think is the most heinous virus that was ever created it would be HIV because it does two things first of all when you're first infected with human immunodeficiency virus and it begins to reproduce itself you make an antibody response to that virus that neutralizes and kills that virus does kills it effectively efficiently but what happens is it continues to evolve during a single infection so that the the surface protein the so-called glycoprotein of that virus two which you make an antibody response to prevent the virus from binding cells continues to mutate again and again and again here we talk about how influenza virus for example mutate so much from one year to the next the natural infection or immunization from the previous year doesn't affect you hence the need for a yearly vaccine this virus does that during a single infection it just continues to mutate and mutate and mutate and mutate number one number two is where does it grow it reproduces self primarily in something called T helper cells which is the major orchestrator of your immune system it's t helper cells that help B cells make antibodies it's t helper cells that help stimulate cytotoxic T cells which kill virus infected cells so it paralyzes the orchestrator of your immune system at the same time that it continues to mutate so that your your immune system never catches up to it it is a remarkably effective virus at being able to kill us I mean we have you know in the late 90s we had it finally developed a highly active antiretroviral therapy as a treatment so we were able to do what we wanted to do which was to make

[00:15:51] HIV a chronic disease but um that That vaccine has remained Elusive and is not it is not because of lack of money or lack of effort I know America you know put several billion dollars into that project and was unsuccessful again with actually with a uh adenovirus Vector into which they then inserted either the the group antigen or the envelope protein or the uh the uh lycoprotein genes and uh it didn't it didn't in any sense work in some ways it was actually worse for those who were vaccinated yeah

[00:16:23] I used to sort of explain it to people as imagine you were up against a foe that you know an army was up against another Army and the the Army knew how to strategically Target the general I mean and the general being the CD4 cell the helper T cell and and all of a sudden you could just sort of abolish any chance of there being a coherent strategy to to fight back but you're right that that those two things the constant mutation and the ability to infect again at least if you come at this from the cellular side the most important cell in the Arsenal is pretty remarkable what is it about those failures that maybe actually sped up the development of vaccines against uh SARS cov2 if anything no I think you you always learn I mean the replication defective adenoviruses that were used it was an adenovirus human stereotype five that was used in the in the Merc trial I think um certainly we learned about replication defective adenoviruses for the Ebola vaccine not not only the the J J vaccine but also there was a replication component of viral Vector using something called vesicular stomatitis virus which is sort of a cousin in many ways of Arabia's um but obviously doesn't cause any of the symptoms or issues or symptoms at all uh so so yeah sure I mean we've learned as we've gone here and with with and with uh HIV you know it's like Jonas salk's strategy was to try and take the whole virus and kill it that obviously was never going to work that was the strategy he had used um he thought it could apply to other things that clearly doesn't apply here that that fire That vaccine has failed and failed and failed I I put that sort of in the same category as like the universal flu vaccine I mean it's not for one of money and it's not for one of effort I train in a flu lab actually in the early 1980s at the Whistler

[00:18:11] Institute here in Philadelphia I was working on rotaviruses but uh but I was trying to make monoclonal antibodies to rotavirus surface proteins but and I was learning to do it in the flu lab and it was just these brilliant researchers you know people like John Udell and Walter Gerhart and loosed out all in one place

[00:18:25] I don't think I realized how lucky I was at that time to be around such amazing scientists but the head of that Lab at the time said something to me I'll never forget and now 40 years later it's still true he said quote if you want a research career that lasts for the rest of your life study influenza I think that's uh that's a virus where it's going to take a long time to catch up to so let's actually talk a little bit about influenza because there's something sort of strange about this coronavirus that fits in between the one and done viruses and influenza and let's just put HIV in its own category because

[00:19:00] I think you've appropriately described it as the single worst virus that's ever been shot into the civilization of mankind I mean it is truly um fortunately an anomaly with regard to how difficult it is but on the one end of the spectrum you have influenza which has so much genetic drift that every year you have to get a new vaccine if you want to have any chance of being vaccinated of course you could say I don't want to be vaccinated because you know it's generally not a very lethal virus but it's bad enough and certainly in high risk populations a vaccine makes a ton of sense um but you know we can't hold our natural immunity to it from year to year to year um at the other end of the spectrum you have polio smallpox pertussis you know pick your favorite of these things where they don't seem to mutate or if they do it I shouldn't say they don't seem to mutate whatever mutations they have don't seem to impact our body's immune system from reacting to them is that so far am I correct on on those two ends of the spectrum yes okay now we have this Coronavirus which seems to be neither of those it's not clear that it has the genetic drift of an influenza where every year it's basically a new virus but it also appears that it ain't one of the other guys too where you're going to be one and done strategy with your vaccine in fact even though b117 looks like it is going to be um managed through current vaccination strategies it is not clear that the

[00:20:42] South African variant the South American variant Brazilian variant are going to respond in that way given significant changes in their binding properties what does that say about this virus if anything or is that simply just the luck of the biologic draw right so I'm not sure I can explain why these viruses act the way they act but but your your assessment was exactly right on the one hand once and end of the spectrum you have flu which which mutates you said correctly year to year it should probably You could argue minute to minute I mean we uh I'm on the fda's vaccine advisor committee the first week in March we always pick flu strains and the way that works is we we the Department of Defense the World

[00:21:25] Health Organization the CDC all present data about about these flu strains that are circulating in in all areas of the world so we can see how these these clades of influenza and subclaves and sub subclaves are constantly sort of moving around so we can try and predict which strains to include and and we certainly work hard to try and get the strains right we usually get them right but you can you it's amazing we get them right given how much this virus mutates and then on the other hand you have an influence a single stranded RNA virus therefore like all single stranded RNA viruses this replication isn't highly faithful but then you have a virus like measles which is also a single strand

[00:22:00] RNA virus which also mutates but mutates in in such a confined way that the vaccines that you introduced or reintroduced in the early 1960s continue to work now you know 50 plus years later and though that virus has never mutated away from the vaccine even though it is also a single-strand RNA virus so then you have this virus also at the stars cov2 virus also a single stranded RNA virus and also does mutate but much more slowly actually than than influenza and in many ways um in a manner that that is is between those two uh between say measles and influenza so it does mutate um and it does um all for the purpose primarily becoming more contagious that's really the main goal of viruses is to continue to reproduce themselves they don't necessarily want to make themselves more virulent more likely to kill you because then they can't reproduce anymore so they really their goal is to be more contagious so so the bat virus which was largely a bad virus it sort of first started in China and swept through his

[00:22:57] China was not the virus that left China the virus that left China was the first variant the so-called d614g variant that was the first variant that's the viruses went through Europe that's the viruses swept through the United States that's the virus that's killed 570 000 people that's the virus to which all vaccines are made to try and prevent the d614g string but now these other variants come up you know the b117 UK variant the the uh the um the Brazilian variant the South

[00:23:22] African variant now the New York variant uh the California variant so there's always going to be variants that are made as the virus tries to be more contagious and so the critical question then is to what extent will it drift away from immunity caused by vaccination and the answer so far is that the b117 is close enough to that initial virus that left China the d614g variant that immunization with one protects against the other well I mean really well it's it's they're they're close enough where there's not really a critical immunological distinction between those two viruses but the South African

[00:23:53] Brazilian strain now the New York strain all the so-called variants of concern or different um or different but not so far critically different in this sense that that I think natural infection or immunization still protects against severe critical disease meaning still protects against hospitalization and ICU admission and and death that's still true um if when we've crossed the line with these variants is when you see when you see and we haven't seen this yet people who are either naturally infected or fully immunized that nonetheless are hospitalized or killed by ovariant virus that that line hasn't been crossed yet now we're looking because now you know as people are getting hospitalized and dying of this virus we always have to look at the virus they're getting infected with and there's an NIH group that's specifically designed to do that to make sure that that we have these people aren't being infected with variants and that that is they're critically different that now you're not even protected against severe critical disease now Paul will there be one other step there sorry to interject but sure how do we know in the situation you just described where someone who's been previously infected or vaccinated becomes infected with a a variant of concern and goes on to have a bad adverse outcome either you know ICU and or death how do we know that it's because their existing immunity was incapable of responding versus they simply had lost immunity are you also checking for some quantitative or qualitative assessment of their existing immunity right so I think what you could say is if you sequence if you isolate a virus sequence it and realize it is just the d64 DG thing or the b117 strain something that should have been fully susceptible to immunos to immunity induced by natural infection immunization then one of those two things is true either you had an adequate immune response and lost it or you never really developed an adequate immune response I'm not sure how easy those two things would be to figure out at that point right it's tough to distinguish those two I think that that's that's the issue but then what happens if they are confronted with the Brazilian variant how will we know if indeed it's the latter problem which you just described or frankly the more frightening problem which is actually no amount of current immunity either acquired from D 614 or through any of the vaccines is going to save you and basically we are back to square one of a pandemic right so I think when we isolate those variants um the question is you take it to the laboratory and see whether or not then the crit the number of mutations that have occurred have occurred to the point that when you take Zero from people who are adequately immunized or people who are naturally infected that it doesn't neutralize that virus in the lab I mean that'll be the first clue that that it is it is it has now escaped recognition by natural or vaccine-induced immunity and we're confident that in in vitro assay to look for neutralizing to look at neutralizing antibodies in the presence of a new variant is pretty sufficient to give us that insight we don't we won't have to rely on epidemiology to give us the answer no I think it's pretty sufficient okay I mean it doesn't nor T helper cell responses which tend to be broader and and are of value and that they do offer that sort of broader immunity where even though there have been mutations in the um in the receptor binding domain or the n-terminal domain that you you still would get some evidence of immunity that's why T helper cell responses are so critical here um but I think we we configured for the most part figure that out okay so the good news about what you're saying Paul is you're holding us to a higher and more conservative standard because what you're basically saying is I can test in vitro what a B cell can do through neutralizing antibodies I can't test what a T cell can do but if it passes the b-cell test I don't need to worry about it now if it fails the B cell test we still don't know about the T Cell test and that can only be played out in the real world but if it's failing the b-cell test we're gonna we're gonna take action presumably we're not going to wait and assume that this is going to work be worked out on the side of T cells I think that's right I mean I think that's right yeah I mean if you look at the work that was done by

[00:28:07] Shane Crotty and others in La Jolla looking at people who are naturally infected and then you know if we're exposed to a virus again we're protected they did find that and while antibody responses fade over time and can fade over five six seven months later that memory B cells are still there and and memory T helper cells or memory cytotoxic T cells are there and that's good you know you have this is a virus that has an incubation period of around six days meaning from the time you're first exposed to when you develop symptoms is about six days that's that's between sort of the the typical mucosal infection like rotavirus or influenza where incubation periods are very short one to two days and a virus like measles or German Measles which have or chickenpox must have incubation periods of 10 to 14 days the longer incubation period diseases are better in the sense that you really can induce sterilizing immunity and therefore you really can't eliminate those viruses we eliminated measles from this country by the year 2000 we eliminated rubella from this country by the year 2005. the only reason measles come back is a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children but those are eliminatable viruses this is not but but because it's um virus in the bloodstream is not an important part of pathogenesis so IGG responses become a little uh so when you have long incubation periods all you need is immunological memory because there's plenty of time for

[00:29:27] Activation and differentiation of memory B cells to become effector cells meaning antibody producing cells and therefore you're good for the shorter incubation periods your hope is to modify disease because of disease like rotavirus which has an incubation period of two to four days you can stimulate like then those memory cells which are long-lived to become antibody producing cells but you've already started to sort of replicate because the incubation period so short and it takes about three to five days to get activation and differentiation memory cells so when incubation periods are short you're the best you can hope for is to modify disease associated with infection so that's true of flu it's true of respiratory and Central virus is true of rotavirus for the for measles on the other hand we have this long incubation period if as long as you have memory cells which are generally long you've lived you have plenty of time for

[00:30:11] Activation and differentiation of those cells to become antibodies reading cells and that's why you can eliminate those diseases this is actually somewhere in between that's about a six day incubation period so um and again virus in the bloodstream is really not an important part of pathogenesis so IG memory cells become a little less important but I I do think that uh that we can control this infection but I think that like all mucosal infections um your two choices basically as we move forward are immunization or natural infection those are your two choices so Paul that's that's actually an amazing insight about how the SARS Co V2 has that sort of gestation period that puts it into kind of an intermediate zone between the short and the long maybe let's take a moment to just explain to people how the cellular immune system comes into play here so I think by this point uh folks who have been paying attention to this understand how the neutralizing antibodies can work on First Contact and how that can provide immunity in the weeks and months following an infection but to your point at some point down the line call it six months later 12 months later a year later you know or whatever 18 months later those neutralizing antibodies may not be there in sufficiently high enough titers what is the actual process by which that virus now gets presented to the cellular immune system such that we can re-engage

[00:31:39] B cells to come out and make more neutralizing antibodies under the instruction of T cells maybe walk people through how that works through antigen presentation Etc right so so the virus would be then picked up by Major antigen presenting cells in the body like dendritic cells macrophages and to some extent B cells broken down into small sort of 10 to 15 myrrh peptides put on the surface of the cell of these antigen presenting cells and then they traveled to T helper cells where they then stimulate T helper cells to do two things one is to is to stimulate B cells to make antibodies too is to simulate cytotoxic T cells to kill virus infected cells but but as long as you have immunological memory as long as you have memory B cells memory T helper cells memory cytotoxic T cells and those are generally longer lived then you can at least have activation and differentiation of those memory cells to become effector cells in the case of B cells antibiot producing cells in the case of cytotoxic T cells T cells that kill virus infected cells so memory is what you want and and I think I guess I was encouraged by the work of Shane crowdy and others that memory cells here do at least after natural infection appear to be fairly long-lived I'm also encouraged by the the um messenger RNA data where after that second dose you clearly get stimulation of T helper cells inside a toxic cells which suggest that you'll have also somewhat longer lived responses I mean I'd like to think that these responses would be durable enough after natural infection or immunization to to protect you for a couple years three years four years I'd like to think that's true I mean we'll we'll see whether or not it ends up being true but the good news about the the MRNA strategy is it's it's a powerful image I I mean I I'm amazed at how effective it is and and one thing that the people can at least can can notice is that many people get trots in their arms so for a variety of vaccines this vaccine often causes lymph node enlargement under your arm so-called ipsilateral lymphadenopathy that's not common um you see it with a smallpox vaccine um which is another powerful ammunition and you see it with this vaccine it's a it is it those those antigen presenting cells travel to the local lymph node and then stimulate that response there to the extent that your lymph node actually enlarges it is a powerful image these mRNA vaccines it's it's so funny that you bring that up Paul I was going to bring that point up later so both my wife and I had whole body MRIs we do this every once in a while for sort of a cancer screening protocol and we had them four days ago and the radiologist said hey I assume you guys have been vaccinated and you know we said yep both vaccinated such and such a time he said okay let me show you something on the

[00:34:18] MRI the radiologist is a very close friend and he said um look at the extent of lymphadenopathy under your arms this is normally something that in a case of a woman would make me think she potentially had breast cancer that's how inflammatory how how concerning these nodes are he said look I've now looked at enough of these in the past couple of months to realize that it's almost always people responding to the vaccination of this virus and he said he is seeing it more with um the J and J pardon me with the um at with the RNA viruses the Pfizer and moderna virus uh the moderna and and

[00:34:57] Pfizer I didn't ask and I should have asked to what extent is he seeing it with the adenoviruses um but I I I I think what you said is very interesting and I only knew of it literally four or five days ago um I want to ask you another question about this which is why is it that the J and J virus is able to provide such a benefit after only one injection whereas the RNA viruses needed that second in injection right and if you look at the um these replication effective assuming or human adenoviruses they appear oh I'm sorry

[00:35:30] The The J J vaccine the replication effective add 26 human adenovirus 26. they induce cellular immunity after a single dose that's really not true with the MRNA vaccines you need that second dose I'm not sure why one is more powerful in terms of one dose versus two doses but that is true which is why it's all the more important to get that second dose of mRNA vaccine there are a lot of people that people who I actually really respect and are well or well known in the in the field of epidemiology or virology who have written op-ed pieces that have gotten a lot of national play on why it is that one dose of mRNA vaccine gives you 80 effective protection whereas the second dose gives you you know 90 or 95 percent and that let's get as much first dose out there as we can I think as long as people realize you need that second dose

[00:36:14] I mean I just worry that people are going to hear well 80 protective after one dose 90 after two doses you know that's not that big of a deal I know that with the second dose there's more side effects so I'm just going to go with one dose and and then confuse it with the fact that J J is vaccine Johnson Johnson's vaccine is one dose this is a two-dose vaccine the MRNA vaccines and the choice not to get that second dose is a choice probably to get less storeable immunity less compute pleat immunity and likely less effective immunity against these variants that have have drifted farther away from the original strain you know one other point on that Paul that I think is a real mistake that the Press has made and frankly I think that the vaccine companies have made is they have not communicated clearly the difference between relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction so when the J J vaccine received its emergency youth authorization I think the headline grabbing statement was hey we just heard that Pfizer is I'm you know 96 effective and moderna 95 percent effective but J and J looks like it's only 66 effective those numbers are probably off by a couple of percent but directionally they are correct and at the surface you would say why in the world would you take the J and J vaccine even though it's only a single shot or you might ask another question which is well what happens if you took two shots of the J and J wouldn't that put it on par

[00:37:37] Etc and it turns out I actually had to go back and look at the data to actually see what the true risk reduction was now I won't go into it here for people because it would take too long but we'll link to it in the show notes we have an entire post I've written about the difference between absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction but you must talk about this in terms of absolute risk reduction and when you look at the absolute risk reduction it turns out that the J and J vaccine has a 1.7 percent absolute risk reduction versus a 1.2 percent absolute risk reduction for moderna and I believe

[00:38:12] Pfizer is actually less than one percent risk reduction these are all great vaccines but it turns out that J and J gets the most bang for its Buck now um I wanted to talk with you about why you think there is that discordance between the lowest relative risk reduction in the mid 60s and the highest absolute risk reduction which is the number that matters approaching two percent do you believe that the Pfizer and moderna vaccines were tested on less susceptible populations and that can you know that that J and J was just tested on a sicker population that was therefore going to benefit more greatly well so they're different strategies so it is interesting how both mRNA strategies had very similar um at least relative risk reduction but you're right I mean that it is interesting how we don't talk about that way we also don't talk about that with with regard to safety issues um the the so if you if you look for example I'm trying to remember the specific numbers for the Pfizer trial but there were like 165 cases of of uh disease in the placebo group in like eight cases in the in the vaccine group so that's 165 cases per in this in the case of the the Pfizer trial was a was a roughly 40 000 person trial so you're roughly it's like 165 cases you know per 20 000 people that got Placebo as compared to like um right as compared to eight cases per 20 000 people who got the vaccine so when you actually divide that all up you know the the absolute difference is not is is uh is is much less dramatic than than is you know the sort of the relative right the Pfizer absolute risk difference was like 0.9 percent and you're right right the total number of cases was about 170 total cases in 20 000 or 40 000 I'm sorry forty thousand but you're right the difference was eight versus like 165 or something like that um and which again makes me just think like these are people who were either less exposed more healthy there was something in these populations that differed dramatically from the J J population where I mean we're talking about 500 infections versus a hundred infections directionally so the relative reduction wasn't as high but the absolute reduction like I said 1.7 percent which we're going to come back to in a moment it's worth keeping the bag of your mind when you have a one per 1.7 percent um absolute risk reduction that means your number needed to treat to prevent a negative a bad out a bad outcome is very low I mean we're talking about what 60 for an nnt no you're right it's interesting that I mean the way I think of it just because it's easier for me to conceptualize it is if

[00:40:59] I if I walk on on the street in front of my house I have a certain risk of being hit by a car if I stand in the in the um just stand in front of my house in the lawn in front of my house um I have another risk of being hit by a car the risk is much greater if I cross the street than if I just stand in front of on the on the grass in front of my house but I cross the street all the time and you know never get hit so still the chances of my being hit are still extremely small even though I cross the street even though the relative risk is much higher the absolute risk is is still very low of being hit by a car and

[00:41:32] I think that's that's what people don't quite understand so so let's talk about the the kind of the elephant in the room today at least which is as of yesterday and by the time this podcast come out this might even be irrelevant news so I don't want to dwell on it too much but as of yesterday uh J and J uh the news came out that J and J's vaccine which as as of this moment has been given to 6.9 million people in the United States has resulted in six serious clotting episodes all in women interestingly probably not a coincidence but it's too soon to tell um and one of whom has died so uh obviously very easy to believe that these side effects are the result of the vaccine given what we saw in the AstraZeneca case not clear if it's a coincidence that it's also in an Adeno virus Vector but regardless let's just think about this for a moment through the numbers six out of 6.9 million people have had a side effect that is completely undesirable one of whom has died which is the ultimate undesirable side effect um but contrast that with the nnt now the data in the uh Jamma paper that I looked at which is where I saw the most robust data on the vaccine at least I couldn't extract from it what the nnt was to Save a Life do you know that so the the nnt data that I quoted which is about 60 uh based on the reciprocal of the uh the ARR so if you take um you know 100 divided by 1.7 whatever that number is I'm doing the math in my head it's about 60. um that's for all reactions so serious reactions hospitalizations death but if you just do it on death I don't know what that is do you I think I think it's something like if you let's assume just for for the purpose of this discussion that it's roughly one case of this so-called cerebrovascular sinus thrombosis or you know blood clot in a vein of the of the brain um per million people who got this vaccine for a million people who who would get the vaccine otherwise something like 1 850 or so would would have there would would be prevented from having what I think would be prevented from dying okay that's the number I'm asking for yeah what's the difference so we can do it for how much how big that number is will be prevented from going to the hospital but to actually be prevented from dying if it's about 2 000 you're talking about a trade-off of two thousand to one and that's why I've got to be honest with you I looked at the reaction of the federal if I read it correctly Paul the federal government basically said we're going to stop this and let States decide and you know New

[00:44:17] York and California immediately said we're going to stop it and again that's not the worst thing in the world if we have enough other vaccines in the pipeline to keep going but my thinking is that's an overreactive strategy if it's going to actually prevent people from being vaccinated isn't it oh and it's going to prevent people from being vaccinated I mean I just think that the minute you did that the minute you pause

[00:44:40] That vaccine you sent a chill through people in this country I think that would affect not only this vaccine but I think even it would spill over to any coveted vaccine which is I think what what worries me the most about this pause I mean I understand why they did it I think they wanted to say to people at the very least this is a an unusual phenomenon and typically when you see for example thrombotic events you invariably treat them with Heparin don't treat this with

[00:45:06] Heparin so I you know just you you know thinking maybe is it introducing the middle globulin is the best treatment but if it happened it's the worst thing you can do for this and and so to alert the Physicians of that also to alert Physicians of the fact that if anybody's gotten the J J vaccine and within two weeks of getting that vaccine had signs and symptoms of severe headache chest pain shortness of breath leg pain to be to pay attention to that I think that all makes sense but by pausing it you know now the city of Philadelphia is not giving That vaccine anymore I think in

[00:45:35] San Francisco they've decided not to give that vaccine and I just think that the point you made earlier is exactly right if it doesn't matter meaning if if we have enough of the Pfizer moderna vaccine that this is not going to in any sense slow our ability to vaccinate this population and get to the level of population immunity that creates herd immunity then it's not that big of a deal but I think that that there's two ways to look at that one is that we have enough vaccine that makes it not a problem but the other thing is that people may now be scared that's what scares me the most in this if you ask me the question what do I fear most about this whole pandemic it's actually not the variance it's not it's it's that there would be a significant percentage of the population that is going to choose not to vaccinate so much so that we can't get to that 80 plus percent of population immunity we need to slow this virus and then what do we do and we're going to know that by the middle of the summer when we have enough vaccine and then we're going to figure out just what percentage of this population doesn't get vaccinated because it's not small I mean I was at the doctor's office yesterday the nurse who checked me in told me she was not going to get a vaccine this is a nurse you know these are people in the medical profession so you can imagine what it's going to be like out there in the real world and we already know those those numbers to some extent you know we know that for example 46 percent of Republican men say that they don't want to get a vaccine 30 of

[00:46:48] Christian evangelists say they don't want to get a vaccine 14 of of those in the black community say they definitely don't want to get a vaccine so there are you know groups out there that are going to be making this Choice we'll see how this plays out so let's talk about what herd immunity means because even something that conceptually makes sense when it comes to the details we're seeing lots of experts disagree on what it's going to take to achieve herd immunity what is your best explanation for not what it means conceptually I think we understand that but for uh specifically what is going to be required and that includes both among children adults very susceptible populations like what is it what does a world look like in which we have herd immunity right so I Define herd immunity for mucosal viruses like rotavirus for example as they sync from non-mucal of our systemic viruses where the virus spreads into the bloodstream like polio and and measles and rubella where you can eliminate that virus we're not going to eliminate that virus this virus I think the best we can hope for is to significantly slow its spread as we did for rotavirus I mean when the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the United

[00:47:58] States um there would be several million cases every year of a rotavirus would be about 75 000 hospitalizations and roughly 60 deaths every year from rotavirus but no no child got to H5 without being infected with that virus that virus came into the United States in 2006 and within a year within a few years you started to see a a dramatic drop in the spread of that virus it's still out there but it's it's much much less and many residents have never seen a case of rotavirus-induced diarrhea and dehydration whereas it dominated my residency um so so you can control it but you're not going to eliminate it so I think that's that's number one um number two is is if you look at sort of the contagiousness index and the um and the efficacy of the vaccine there's a formula for this you would figure you that you probably would need at least 80 percent of the population to be immune either from natural infection or immunization to slow the the spread of this virus but this virus I think it's going to be with us forever I I don't see it going away I think it's just gonna um slowly get under control assuming we can get the 194 countries in this world to to get a significant percentage of their population vaccinated but know this we're going to be giving a a coronavirus asaurus cov2 vaccine for a continually until it happens that other countries have gotten it under control because you know we give a polio vaccine every year to children in the United

[00:49:17] States we haven't had a case of natural polio in this country since the 1970s the reason we do that is polio still exists in Pakistan and Afghanistan and so international travels common so polio could always come back in this country and I think that's going to be true here too we're going to see how long immunity lasts we're going to see whether the variants get to the point where they escape immunity from natural infection immunization but all that is going to play out over Years and we're going to be dealing with this for years I just but I do think we can get control of this virus if we can get at least 80 percent of the population you mentioned the point that we can go back to the north things we normally do like going to Eagles games and screaming and booing without a mask that is my goal well as a person who really can't stand the Eagles you'll have to forgive me that I have no interest in you going to Eagles games unless you are booing because your team is doing poorly now that said um let's go back to the person like this nurse who you saw the doctor's office the other day who says I'm not going to get the vaccine now um my view is there's going to be a subset of the population that will never be convinced that that is the right strategy or or more more to the point that getting a vaccine is a safe alternative to getting coveted um so that's fine uh it you know I think we do live in a world where medical freedom for his uh adults exist and I support that so I do support a person's right to choose to not get a vaccine can't we still get to herd immunity when enough healthy people who have refused vaccination survive the infection because we certainly have seen that natural infection is going to be a great way to develop immunity so I don't know what the numbers are but is it safe to say about 30 percent of American adults don't want to get vaccinated um I don't know I mean I that that I I if I had to guess I think it's probably that about 30 maybe more um and you're right in terms of natural immunity and that um we we you know if you if you look on the reports you know on this kova tracker that says 32 000 people sorry 32 million people have been infected with with SARS cov2 and have covid um but that that's the only people who've been tested found to be infected if you do antibody surveillance studies at that fact that number that could be much higher factor three it's probably it's probably more like the CDC estimated list I saw which was a few weeks ago was 85 million it's probably closer to 100 million people who've been infected with this virus and are naturally immune um and then we don't know the overlap between those people and then who's been vaccinated there's obviously going to be a Venn diagram you can't add these things up I guess the way I look at it is even with a modest success of the vaccine and those let's just say those 30 percent of people who say I'm not going to be vaccinated you know someone's got to be able to come up with a reasonable estimate for how many of those people were knowingly infected in the past were unknowingly infected in the past and and so in other words those people you could argue you don't need a vaccine then you've got the group who have not been infected who don't want to get vaccinated well a subset of those people are going to get infected and therefore will develop natural immunity for those of us who choose to get vaccinated Paul is it really that big a concern at the number of people who don't want to get vaccinated well first of all we're also assuming that natural infection induces a a durability and completeness of protection that is that is the same as vaccines that may not be true I mean the vaccine there are certainly a number of vaccines the human papillomavirus vaccine is one example tetanus is another the conjugate hibbon pneumococcal vaccines are another example where the vaccination is better than natural production in terms of the immunity to seduced that may also be true here well I think it's perfectly reasonable to give then a dose of vaccine dose of the MRNA containing vaccines sort of the booster strategy for those who are natural that's fine I

[00:52:59] I do see you and I are going to differ on one thing which is is a person's right to choose not to be vaccinated I think if I cut my foot on a rusty nail for example go to the doctor's office get it washed out and the doctor says I would recommend a tetus vaccine and I choose not to get attendance vaccine that only affects me I mean no if I get that and there's nobody's going to catch tetanus for me that's not true here I mean when you make a choice not to get a vaccine you are making a choice potentially to catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection and see I don't think that's your choice I think that that should not be you're inalienable right as a U.S citizen to affect others I mean if you're if you're going to stay in your in your house and and the only time you ever walk outside is you're going to be really good about wearing a mask and making sure you're four to six feet away from somebody else great but that's not the way it's going to play out and and I think we're dealing with that in our hospital now is the issue of mandating a vaccine we we you know we have a population of vulnerable hospitalized children uh certainly viruses like this can spread in a hospital and and is it your responsibility as someone who works in a hospital in a group of vulnerable hospitals children to get a vaccine we think the answer is yes well I would agree with you on that so so I mean obviously these things are nuanced I'll tell you where my view is there are going to be some people for whom there is a privilege that comes from your existence so for me Health Care is a privilege to be a doctor or a nurse is a privilege not a right and so I would agree with you if you're going to work in a hospital and take care of patients

[00:54:23] I do not believe you should have the right to refuse vaccination for exactly the reasons you've stated furthermore I would agree that and this is getting way off topic but when it comes to MMR I don't think that parents should be able to refuse that for their child because I don't think it's fair to the children in other words I don't think a parent should be able to make a decision that's going to negatively impact a child

[00:54:46] I will go one step further this is gonna I'm sure make I'm sure every statement I'm making is making a newer and newer faction of people I rate so the last one I'll say is I think that Society may have to make decisions about who can and can't have other certain privileges such as travel so I think that there should be a day when if we decide you know what like people who haven't been vaccinated or haven't conferred natural immunity through some other means and can demonstrate it maybe we don't want to have all those people traveling on airplanes or maybe certain countries are going to say you can't enter unless you've done those things so

[00:55:23] I don't think I think you and I would probably be aligned on everything I just said I think where we do differ is if you know John Smith who works in you know whatever he does doesn't want to get vaccinated you know provided he provided his Society his network is okay with that you know and he's not lying about it or something which again I think there are ways around that um I think you know you have to live with the consequences of your choice when people say to me why would you

[00:55:55] Peter as a healthy you know roughly 50 year old get vaccinated when your odds of dying are so low from a natural infection I say frankly my concern is not death I I think my odds of dying from this virus are so low that you know I'm more I'm much more afraid of dying in a car accident what I'm afraid of are the long-term consequences of this that don't seem trivial even in young people and you know there was an article in Gemma maybe two months ago that talked about some of the long-term uh Neuropsychiatric complications that are being seen in up to a quarter of people 6 and 12 months out and to me those are the things that are of grave concern and again when you weigh the risk of that versus the risk of vaccination which I think you very eloquently spoke to at the outset to me it's personally a no-brainer but that said um you know there are gray areas in between that said of course I agree with you about in the hospital I I think it's a tragedy that a high-risk patient would be cared for by someone in a hospital who has willingly or knowingly chosen not to be vaccinated but see I I would this is probably the one area we're going to disagree but I think see I see the hospitals of microcosmos society I mean if I um there was um they're probably about 500 000 people or so in this country who can't be vaccinated because they're getting uh Biologicals for their chronic disease because they're getting a chemotherapy for their cancers they depend on those around them to protect them I mean I remember when when

[00:57:25] California suffered its measles epidemic um and and Richard pan who was a democratic state senator out of Sacramento basically eliminated the philosophical exemption leaving California with with only medical exemptions they don't have they never had a religious example so they they they they now they only had medical exemptions if you went to school in

[00:57:44] California um you had to be vaccinated or you you could homeschool there was a little boy who showed up in those meetings and certainly the anti-vaccine folks were all over those meetings they didn't want this this exemption eliminated and this he was great I just wish there was a videotape of him because I've heard what he said and I've seen pictures of him but he it's a little kid named Lou who was five years old and he was in the induction phase of his chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and he would get up to the microphone they'd have to give him a stool so he could reach the microphone and he would say what about me I depend on you to protect me don't I count and I think that that's how I see I see the hospital in some ways as Society you know you don't know who you're running into when you're getting on a Subway or a bus or whatever and that could be those could be the looks out there so I

[00:58:28] I don't think if it's a contagious disease that that's that's where I sort of draw the line so love to discuss this more over a meal let's talk about the implication of it though do we believe because I don't think it's going to happen is it from a practicality standpoint is there any chance this is going to be mandated at the private level there's already is at some level and a carrot not stick sort of way where you know a number of universities now said want to come back to campus great love to have you get vaccinated if not you're going to continue to sure and and just as travel restrictions may only open up to those who are vaccinated I mean I completely I think that's exactly the right way to do it but my point is we'll never do what

[00:59:10] California did which is say you don't get to send a kid to school without vaccination which by the way I think was the right thing to do a hundred percent but I don't see how you would enforce or make something like that happen in society so assuming we don't what do you think is the duration of time from now until we achieve herd immunity based on what you know about the speed with which the vaccines are rolling out uh and The

[00:59:34] Limited information we have about the rates of natural infections which are obviously challenging to to comprehend right so let's assume the following let's assume that about 25 as you said earlier I think it's right about let's say about 25 or 30 minutes maybe as many as 30 percent of the time population has been naturally infected we know that about about 22 to 23 percent of the the general population has also been now fully vaccinated with the adult population so it may be a little more than that and you're right there's overlap in terms of having been infected or haven't been vaccinated so so let's assume we're getting close to 40 percent to get to 80 you're probably going to need to fully immunize another 120 million people we're vaccinating more than three million people or three million doses of vaccine a day these are mostly two dose vaccines so we'll if you just play out the math it's possible that within if we continue to get three million dose a day out there that within three or four months we could have vaccinated that other 120 million people

[01:00:31] I think by mid-summer when there's enough vaccine for everybody that's when you're going to really find out how many what percentage this population doesn't want to get vaccinated and then we'll see what we're going to do but and the way that you'll test you'll know whether or not we've succeeded with herd immunity is what happens next winter this is still at its heart largely a winter respiratory virus and if you look at what happened when the virus came into the U.S in early March and started to kill people it quickly shot up you would have two thousand twenty five hundred deaths so just want to get death deaths a day and then it started to come down as you went to sort of April May

[01:01:00] June you started to see it the number of deaths per day come down this was in a wholly susceptible population without a vaccine and then you see for for the summer months you were sort of at hundreds of deaths a day then once you hit November December it took off again two thousand deaths a day three thousand deaths a day four thousand deaths a day 4 500 deaths a day and then now it started to come down again and I think that there's several reasons either one because a larger percentage of population is immune from natural infection because a larger percentage population is immune now with vaccination but I think also the weather has something to do with this um and so it's it's now started to come down what happens then next winter if we're at population immunity that is effective then I will see you will see a bump in the winter month if we're not you're going to see a surge just like we saw this winter in the winter month and and that's how you'll know but we're going to be vaccinating this population for my lifetime uh because I just think this is a virus that's not going to go away we're going to continue to need to keep up that population that's that's immune and and that's also going to involve children so now you know we've got an approved vaccine down to 12 years of age I think by early next year we'll probably have it down to six years of age and then and then we're going to need to I think vaccinate children as well and will that be because children are vectors or because we actually fear harm to the kids themselves both but I I was on service for two weeks in a row uh about a week ago and uh it's the same thing that you you mentioned earlier in terms of like fear of long-term disease um it you should see what Missy looks like up close I mean this so-called multi-system inflammatory disease in children which is is is not uncommon and and they all tell the same story a very similar story which is that they had an incidental infection something that was picked up often because a family member or friend got sick and so then they had they were tested to be PCR positive but were asymptomatic a month later they come now to our house with high fever um involvement of heart liver lung kidney um you know heart enzymes spilling out into the bloodstream with high fever and and their PCR negative and their antibody positive I mean their immune system has been uh induced to make it an inflammatory response against themselves

[01:03:06] I think primarily against the cells that line vessels and so so this is a largely a vasculitis and because every organ in your body has a blood supply virtually every organ can be affected it's pretty frightening to see and do I think that some of these kids are going to have long-term problems I absolutely do for the same reason Kawasaki's did that I mean also another multi-system inflammatory disease that could cause you know long-term heart problems I think that is likely to be true here we're going to learn as we go but if a parent sat across from me uh in in my office and ask me why should I vaccinate my child these are the stories I would tell the Miss C stores yeah I mean I I wish I had a crystal ball that would show us the data we're going to have a year from now like when you think about how much we have learned in 12 months it it has been a geometric a geometric outflow of knowledge and the next 12 months we'll offer I think even more insight because as you said we're going to be laying over the natural infection the vaccine Immunology will also as you basically alluded to really have a true sense of what steady state is going to look like societally with respect to vaccine refusal and so we will be able to incorporate that into models of how close we are going to get to that herd immunity um but but let's talk about it through the two scenarios there's a scenario clearly where enough people refuse vaccination that we never truly achieve herd immunity and in that sense the real tragedy is for the vulnerable people who can't be immunized correct I mean I think that's a very clear thing to acknowledge is there's going to be a subset of people who because of their cancer treatment or rheumatologic treatments can't be vaccinated and the the disease is still spreading like crazy um then there's a scenario under which we get to herd immunity on the backs of people who are naturally infected and or are willing to be vaccinated inclusive of children and have you done the math on how far down you need to go in kids ages to almost assure that happens in other words if you go down to six years of age is that pretty much a Theta complete oh for sure okay you may not even have to get down there okay I mean it's something like um 20 of the population is less than 18 years of age so you're assuming all adults got vaccinated which isn't going to happen um you know you're already talking about 80 but but the the other reason I think that that that deaths are down if you look at Michigan for example clearly there's been a surge of cases in

[01:05:26] Michigan but not really a surge in deaths and I think the reason is is that it's something like 55 or 57 of people over 65 now have have been been vaccinated fully and something 75 percent have gotten at least one dose of vaccine so we're starting to to pull out of the group The the group that those that are most likely to die it's something like 92 percent of those over 55 or those over 55 account for 92 percent of the deaths so um you know we're now pulling them out and so that's

[01:05:53] I think it's one not one of the several reasons why the deaths are clearly coming down now uh Paul how long do you think it'll be before we know the frequency with which people need to be given a booster shot and is this going to be a single booster shot that should be more than enough to make sure that the memory T and B cells are rocking and rolling or do you think that and by the way I'm putting aside for a moment mutation so let's put that aside for one second but just on the basis of b117 d614 uh is it your immunologic expectation that if you've had your two rnas you'll need one more if you've had your one Adeno you'll need one more and that should be it or is it are we talking about an annual or biannual process

[01:06:43] I think we'll know in two years I think we'll have much better idea in two years how this plays out there were studies done with human coronaviruses human challenge studies done with human coronaviruses in the early 1990s where they would you know someone be infected with a zero type of one of the four zero types of human coronavirus that circulates and then a year later they were experimentally challenged with that virus to see answer the question were they protected against symptoms associated with uh illness and and they were a year later but they never did those studies beyond that um yeah certainly it's uh it's I'm I'm optimistic that it would be for a few years but I don't think that we're talking about decades okay let's pivot to another question that has come up a lot and when it first arose which was a year ago if not more than a year ago the people who were raising it sounded crazy and today it doesn't sound so crazy which is the origin of this virus so there are largely two competing theories the first is the theory that was proposed at the time of the pandemic the pandemic's arrival which is that this was a virus that escaped from a bat or left a species of a bat via some intermediary mammal and made its way to humans this originated in a wet Market uh in China and that's kind of the story everybody knows but with increasing uh

[01:08:06] I don't want to say veracity but certainly with with more and more reason behind it there are lots of people offering explanations for another the idea that this was actually an accidental Escape of a virus in a lab that happened to be near Wuhan so I guess there were three labs near Wuhan that would do this type of research this

[01:08:26] Theory does not suggest biological warfare that this was deliberately Unleashed but rather that you know any lab can have a breach in protocol that could result in a virus leaving how how much have you examined this Theory right well it's not but certainly it is not unheard of that Laboratories have done so-called gain of function studies to see what would happen if they alter a virus and then cause it to be able to do things it couldn't do before so for example you could take rabies but I'm not saying you should do this or how easy it would be to do this but you would take rabies virus which is essentially a universally fatal virus but not easily transmitted I mean in order to get rabies virus you usually have to be bitten by a rabid animal and make it such that it is spread by the respiratory group so now you have a contagious virus that is highly fatal which I think was basically the um the story behind the movie Contagion I think it was a Nipa virus that that killed Gwyneth Paltrow and that in that movie and and others but um and because they showed an electron micrograph of it and it I think it was this was a Nipa virus which is you know not easily transmitted and they made it easily transmitted it's something that affects the brain they made easier so you to certainly gain of function Studies have been done is it is it possible that that um somebody in in Wuhan was doing these kinds of gain and function studies that this I'm telling you though this is like the world's smartest new I honestly don't think humans were smart enough to make this virus given all the things that it could do the only way to know really know the answer to the question because I think this is a knowable question is to go back and look at all the sequences of those early strains as and go back as early as you can and look at you know Sarah from people in China you know from from well before this virus was said to have spread I mean think about it we we really depended on a whistleblower in Wuhan to tell us what was going on which was China not acting like a good neighbor here um so but and that's the way it's the way we did it with HIV I mean when we finally got all the sequences that we needed with HIV as we go back further and further and further to see when exactly to evolved from so-called Simeon immunodeficiency virus I mean the chimp virus you could see that it happened in

[01:10:35] Cameroon in the 1930s presumably when a hunter cut the chimp and then cut himself and introduced the virus into himself but so it's knowable I just don't think we know so now we're left with the sort of postulates as to how it happened my my bias is that um it jumped from about to humans presumably from an intermediate host that remains unidentified you know people have suggested maybe it's pangolins but that's knowable if we can just have all the sequence data we need in China has not been great about opening its doors and letting us see all that information um if you assume that it occurred naturally it begs the question um if versus when this occurs again because coronaviruses have been around longer than we have there's no reason to believe that SARS Co V2 is the last of them so what what is the implication for

[01:11:30] SARS cov3 oh we can assume this is going to happen I mean you know we had SARS one which was largely a bad virus we had MERS which came out of Saudi Arabia which was also at least a part of that virus and now you have you know Soros cov2 three viruses all within roughly 20 years right SARS one was around 2002 so it was around 2012. um it'll happen I mean I'd like to think what we've learned from this is is that that it will happen that we need a level of international collaboration that with a minute there's evidence that this is going on that there's an international surveillance system where all countries are open to this where we can identify it you know do the kinds of works we need we need to do not just to make a vaccine but to have you know personal protective equipment and ventilators or anything else that you're going to need so that we're not overwhelmed by this I mean this unless you're 130 or 140 years old and lived through the 1918-1919 flu pandemic no one has lived through this and and now I'd like to think this has sobered us up as to what needs to be done moving forward do you think that there's a chance that if the next variant of this comes along which is even worse than this one so pick so either it's more virulent but has the same degree of transmissibility or its similar virulence but an even greater transmissibility either of those would make for a much worse pandemic um do you think that there's a chance that such a virus emerges that a given population locally could be shut down enough to identify quickly patient zero you know the first 50 people and immediately quell this thing or do these types of things never result in a local shutdown that is effective and they will always turn into something bigger because the difference between SARS one and MERS is not so much that the response was amazing I mean in the case of MERS I think the thing was just such a deadly virus that it it it didn't have a high enough reproductive rate because it was killing people too quickly so I don't it's not like we did such a great job with those viruses it was really the biology of the viruses right right I think both SARS won and Mars were did not have this level of asymptomatic transmission I think that that was what makes this virus so awful and that when you walk past somebody in the street who's perfectly fine they could be shedding this virus that really wasn't true with SARS one or MERS where most of that disease was was either moderate or severe so it was much easier to put a moat around those those infections than you can hear because everyone could be infected there's actually many ways it reminds me of polio I mean I am a child of the 50s I'm much older than you are but I remember polio but part of the heinousness of polio was that only about one of every 200 people who was infected with poliovirus was paralyzed there was a lot of asymptomatic transmission to that virus so what does that mean though Paul how confident are you that uh you know 10 years from now we're not going to have another worldwide pandemic that um you know the analogy I used to describe this to somebody the other day was uh when you're driving a race car the worst thing you can be doing is breaking too late because then you have to break much harder than you want to and the Dynamics of the car become really unstable and you're probably going to crash and in some ways I sort of feel like that's what happened in the United

[01:14:43] States which is we didn't break soon enough and when we did break we had to break way harder than we should have and we crashed and I want to believe we could learn from that right so it's it's that was such a great analogy I I do think that um it's the at the heart of that question is is how much do I have faith in human nature that we can learn from these things that we we will have the kind of heart big heartedness that will allow us to have uh International collaborations and more open borders regarding sort of scientific inquiry we haven't been very good at that so far if we don't learn our lesson here I mean we're never going to learn it so I I don't know I don't have an enormous amount of faith in human nature that we're going to learn from this but I hope you're right um yeah I wasn't suggesting I was right

[01:15:33] I was just I was wondering what would need to happen right what would let me pose it to you this way uh Paul if if someone came to you and said um hey I want to put you in charge of thinking about the next pandemic you're doing a great job helping us with this one but we've got a lot of people thinking about this one I want you to go on vacation for two weeks recharge uh you know shake the dust off a little bit and I want you to come back and the only thing I want you to do is think about how we're going to prepare for the next one what would you what would be some of the ideas you'd put forth well I think I think you you it's an international collaboration it's an international question so you have to get get the governments and the scientists from every nation in this world in in in line with what are we going to do collectively to monitor for the next pandemic potential virus and there will be a next pandemic potential virus in terms of surveillance how are we going to do that how are we going to do the sequencing who's going to do it and then once in hand when we see that that's true how are we going to collaborate to do this the the the the the to make sure we all have what we need because we're all dependent on each other because we're only as strong as our weakest

[01:16:44] Nation out there how are we going to do that but but even with with the vaccines you see a certain level of nationalism right there's sort of the Chinese have their vaccines the Russians have their vaccines we have our vaccines it's uh the fact of the matter is uh one thing that I think Dr fauci is amazing I I he's in a phenomenal science

[01:17:02] Communicator he is he's a brilliant man the only time he's ever said anything that that bummed me out a little bit was when when somebody asked him about um about uh you know the the whether or not um there would be another vaccine that would be submitted for licensure like the UK AstraZeneca vaccine being submitted for UA approval here and his response to that was we don't need another vaccine we have enough vaccine for our country but I think our country has a responsibility to all countries in this world where economically and technologically advanced to provide vaccine for everyone if we can and we can you know the Pfizer look at look at these these mRNA vaccines they're given at 30 micrograms or 100 micrograms a dose a microgram is a millionth I'm sorry a millionth of a grand you can make that's 10 to the minus six right you can make kilograms that's 10 to the third right that's that's a nine log difference that's a billion fold difference can you make billions of doses of mRNA vaccine absolutely should you absolutely and if it means we're restricting sort of the intellectual property and and allowing that to happen it should happen because because it's the right thing to do for these companies if and and for the world um this is an unrelated question to where I want to go but while we're here on the topic do you have any idea what vaccine hesitancy rates are like outside of the United States I actually haven't looked at those data right so there's there's a woman named Heidi Larson at the London School of Public Health who does this she has something called a vaccine confidence project so she goes throughout countries in this world to see sort of what what she measures vaccine confidence she recently had a book out that came out called stuck but um interestingly we're not the least confident country in this world the the least confident country in this world for vaccinations is you France all right don't know why yeah France France is number one um so so we're not actually that bad but um again it's it's see I sort of divide this into two categories I think there's the Skeptics and it's and I'm a skeptic

[01:18:57] I think you should be skeptical of anything you put in your body I think you should want to see the data to make sure that what you're being given has been adequately tested and vetted um I think skepticism at this point certainly for the MRNA vaccine should melt away you've got a highly effective vaccine that doesn't even appear to have a rare serious side effect problem and it's been in 120 million people in the

[01:19:16] United States skepticism should be gone and and I think largely it among that group it has when you look at sort of percentage of people who said they would definitely get a vaccine let's say last September it was about 30 percent then by December was it was 40 the University of Washington um came out with recently a survey that suggested it's about 70 that said they would definitely get a vaccine and then there's the second group which are the vaccine cynics and they just don't trust uh the government or trust pharmaceutical companies or trust the medical community they just don't believe you they don't believe you it's amazing to me that some of those people are also in the medical profession but that's been the experience so you can't convince them Neil deGrasse Tyson has just a great quote on this which is if people don't use reason or logic to come to a specific conclusion reason and logic are not going to talk them out of it so then what do you do and then this is what we were talking about earlier do you compel them either with the character or the stick to to get vaccinated because what they do affects others when I think back at the looking at the past year Paul um this is my opinion which I'm only stating so you can contrast it with something that's probably much more uh much more thoughtful my view of the greatest single failure in the past year was how long it took to get testing up and running I when I think about the absolute buffoonery on the part of

[01:20:37] I think it was frankly mostly on the part of the government but but I'm sure there were others others at hand it was the inability to make testing readily available now I don't think it was at the obvious level I mean I think there are things that probably weren't in place in other words how much reagent existed for PCR to begin with you know uh you know but but you'd like to think that in a future pandemic or in preparedness for a future pandemic you would have enough PCR machines you would have enough reagent you would have enough other critical infrastructure such that the moment you had a sequence because getting the sequence of this via virus was not the rate limiting step the moment you had a seek sequence you would be able to rapidly deploy tests to contain this thing and

[01:21:29] I think a lot of the things that have happened since that time have been actually pretty good like I mean the speed with which the virus has been developed within the fact sorry with which the vaccine has been developed has been remarkable I think the evolution of insight into Critical Care has actually been pretty darn impressive so I think a lot of things have gone kind of well but boy that that testing thing is really what goes back to my analogy of coming you know waiting way too deep in the corner to hit the brakes and then slamming on the brakes and crashing the car what's your assessment of where we really lost things this time around and therefore where we'd want to really make sure we we had it right the next time around right I I completely agree with you I mean we had the sequence in Hand by January of 2020. the virus started to kill people in this country two months later was that enough time to be able to make uh to to be able to create produce and distribute enough tests that we could have done what South Korea did we're not South Korea area in many ways

[01:22:30] I think there we are a much more diverse population that is much less corralable if you will and so but I do think that that we put all our eggs in the CDC basket it was just CDC that was making the test was it should have been many many groups that were making those tests initially and quality controlling for them because what happened was then CDC screwed up they did they screwed up the testing so that their negative control ended up being positive therefore those tests were useless and so by the time that all got sorted out South Korea had done 500 000 tests when we had done you know fewer than five thousand it was pathetic pathetic and and by do if we had done that and again I just don't think we didn't have great Federal leadership either that's today's understatement in terms of this where you could have said let's get things in place to do the testing do the quarantining do the Restriction of international travel that would have have uh allowed us to be much better off

[01:23:22] I mean we are roughly roughly at four percent of the world's population and 20 percent of the world's deaths when we have a technologically and economically advanced Society so there's really no excuse for for doing it as badly as we did it but I think the testing was one big reason I agree well Paul there are actually several things I want to talk with you about more but I also know that given that the news of J and J's vaccine just hit you are probably um being dragged in a million different directions so I want to let you get on with those obligations and I'm incredibly grateful that you uh made time to still speak with me today obviously far less important than speaking with all the other people that are clamoring at your door today so thank you again for making time as as it was the case last time just a phenomenally interesting discussion to me I learned a lot and I know that the the folks watching this did as well well though thank you I can tell you that you'll be the most interesting smartest person that was clamoring in my door as
