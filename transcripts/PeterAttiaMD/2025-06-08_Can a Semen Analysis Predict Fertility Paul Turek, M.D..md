This clip is from episode 351 ‒ Male fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility, and navigating testosterone replacement therapy | Paul Turek, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- What a Semen Analysis Really Measures – Key variables include volume, concentration, motility, shape (morphology), viscosity, and round cells
- Morphology: Why Only 4% Normal Is Considered “Normal” – Human sperm is naturally variable in shape, but certain consistent abnormalities can affect fertility
- Single Analyses Can Be Misleading – Semen parameters vary 50–100% from sample to sample, so at least two samples are needed for an accurate assessment

## AI Summary

Here's my detailed analysis of the episode segment:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This segment of The Drive podcast features Dr. Paul Turek discussing semen analysis and male fertility. He describes semen analysis as a "poker hand" with multiple parameters to evaluate, including sperm count, motility, morphology, and various liquid characteristics. The discussion highlights that semen analysis is a relatively blunt instrument for predicting fertility unless sperm count is zero, and explores the surprisingly low percentage (4%) of morphologically normal sperm in healthy men.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Semen analysis includes volume, count concentration, motility, forward progression, and morphology [00:00:00]
- Only 4% of human sperm need to be morphologically normal for fertility, compared to 99% in marine species [00:02:46]
- Calcium channel activation prevents multiple sperm from entering an egg [00:05:38]
- PLZA deficiency affects calcium channels and is associated with globospermia [00:06:16]

**7. Biomarkers & Testing**:
Key parameters in semen analysis:
- Volume measurements [00:00:00]
- Sperm count (numbers per milliliter) [00:00:00]
- Motility percentage [00:00:00]
- Forward progression quality [00:00:00]
- Morphology assessment [00:00:00]
- Round cell count (should be less than 1 million) [00:00:41]

**9. Notable Quotes**:
"I think what I would like to emphasize in this podcast is how fluid evolution actually is. And it's sperm driven and it's transgenerational." [00:07:29]

**10. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms behind calcium channel activation in fertilization?
2. How do lifestyle factors specifically impact sperm morphology?
3. What are the latest developments in AI-assisted semen analysis?
4. What is the evolutionary explanation for human sperm having such low morphological normalcy compared to other species?

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or provide more detailed analysis of specific topics discussed in the transcript?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] You're looking for obviously the count and the motility. What else do you look for? So in the SE analysis, there's several features. I consider it sort of a poker hand. Uh there's a volume. How much of the semen volume? There's a count concentration of sperm. That's numbers per mill. And then there's motility, which is percent motion. You do a forward progression. So how good is the quality of motion? And typically some measure of shape called morphology. There's three liquid issues. liquefaction, aglutination, uh, and viscosity. And then you look for other cells that aren't sperm. They're called round cells. And either they're going to be pus cells or immature germ cells that are early ejaculated early.

[00:00:41] And presumably you want to see fewer of those, right? There's a number like less than a million is normal. Okay? So if you ask me, well, how do I look at a seam analysis? That's a little different. I look at that as a poker hand with each card has a meaning, but they have a look. So if you said, "What do you mean by that?" So if the volume is low, it's one of five things. You're always going to find something. It's at the collection error. I call it first sample syndrome. Guy's not good at it, right? You know, it's like, "Okay, I got to put it in the cup and I got to stop doing what I'm doing." And okay, you know, so so you do a second sample and then there's low testosterone can cause it. There's an absent vast difference, which means you have an absent seminal vesicle. There's a jactory structure.

[00:01:20] And by the way, do you ever have that on one side and not the other or is that always okay? Mhm. Yeah. I know it's very variable. It's segmental. Yep. And so there's five real issues. So when I see a low volume semen as a surgeon and as a do I mean I'm going to find something. So that's really good. Other than that, the seaman is a I I I think I've been published as saying it's a blunt instrument for fertility unless it's zero.

[00:01:42] You can't really say much about their fertility because people conceive at all levels and people are there scenar you know obviously you rattled off a whole bunch of parameters that you can access there but are there certain null states that don't exist where everything is amazing but this one thing is horrible like do you see scenarios where everything is remarkable perfect motility but bad morphology or perfect morphology isolated isolated you do see isolated things right so one of them is called I call it syndroic sperm shape problem so you can have perfectly normal semen analysis count, motility, volume, progression, and the sperm look terrible. And so there are rare conditions, one in 5,000, where you might have globospermia or two-tailed sperm or pin head sperm. So if you look at shape, 4% should look normal, which is terrible. We can have a whole discussion about why 4% of human sperm being normal is normal when 99% of animal species in the wild have normall-looking sperm. But it's all a construct, right? It's all a construct of who someone decided what normal is.

[00:02:46] But in men who have large abnormal forms, like 4%'s normal, if they're 1% normal, and you look at the abnormalities, I'm sorry, I'm still confused on that point. Are you saying that in a you would consider it perfectly normal if only 4% of the sperm are morphologically perfect and 96% are not? And that means the 96% that are not could be pin head, could be double tail, amorphous or tapering. Going back to the original, that's that's a as a mathematician that's not a great number, is it? No. And if you look at marine species, 999 look perfect in the wild.

[00:03:21] Yeah. And presumably that's because their environment is so much more hostile. Like they're doing this all in the ocean. I don't know. But it's it's amazing that we're that good with the sperm. But again, it's a construct. It's like putting stars ordering stars in the universe. Cassiopia, someone named

[00:03:36] Krueger said, "This is what a normal sperm looks like." And but we know that two-tailed sperm have double. I mean, it might be the two-tail might not be the worst thing in the world if it's just extra rocket boosters. But what about the pin head? What does the pin head imply? It means there's no nucleus. It's a tail. So, that's a true problem. Yeah.

[00:03:52] Just like a little tiny head and moving along. So, if you if you if you rule out if you if you give somebody credit for their two tails, what's what does your normal go up to from 4%? Oh, it depends, but maybe 20. Okay, so there's still 80% that would most of them are going to be amorphous. Head's a little rounder, heads a little narrower. Those are called stress patterns. And things like hot bads and varicosils and smoking will do that bad. So in the case of 1% normal, you got to look at the 99%.

[00:04:21] Because that's not the story. The story is in the other half, the other chunk, right? And if they're all looking the same, then it's syndroic and then you have a problem. I see. So the more homogeneous the failures are, the more likely that you have a clear ideology and that's hard to fix. I mean they'll fail with sex, they'll fail with inseminations, they'll fail with IVF.

[00:04:44] They'll fail with IVF. Yeah. They'll fail with IVF Nixie. And sometimes with globospermia where they're called lollipop sperm, they just have a big round head with no acrome there's all nucleus and there's some of the components they'll just bounce off an egg. They'll never work, right? They'll never work naturally. And to get them to work with IVF, you have to single sperm inject them into the egg and then shock the egg with calcium. Do a calcium or pisoelectrics to get it to to to actually fertilize because it also introduc the sperm is important with fertilization. Not only has to bind, but it in the calcium channels are regulated by sperm. And what shuts the doors to poly in an egg is calcium activation. This is the reason why even if you launch a hundred sperm at an egg, it's only one that can get in because the first guy that breaches sets off the calcium channel that shuts the I mean the Star

[00:05:38] Wars space analogies here are are they're just phenomenal, right? Million years. A million years no more breaches in the hole. So there so morphology can matter a lot but it's very rare. So, I'd say twice a year in my practice, I'll see this because everything's failing and everything looks normal and they ask me what's going on and I'll look at it really closely and say, "You have this issue and there's not much we can do to treat it." Now, we're going to try sperm sorting technologies which are out new on the market, micrfluidics and things like that. And I've been throwing that at them. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And is that something that we know the genetic underpinning of?

[00:06:16] We're getting there. PLZA deficiency is one of them recently discovered that that runs the calcium channel which tends to be associated with a certain look like global spermia. So it's coming around. Think about that for a second from an evolutionary perspective. That that is the single least desirable genetic mutation you could acquire.

[00:06:38] Yeah. Unless you're not making sperm. Yeah. But but this is a dead end to the genome. Right. Right. So, does that mean it is only an an acquired mutation, never inherited? I mean, it can't be inherited presumably unless it's homozygous, but even still, that's one of the 50 we throw off in each generation. 50 mutations. God, that's just incredible. I think what I would like to emphasize in this podcast is how fluid evolution actually is. And it's sperm driven and it's transgenerational. So if you ask me what's the theme for today, I'd say sperm matter a lot. A lot a lot more than we've given them credit for. All right. So let's talk about so so basically just rounding out the semen analysis physical analysis on the semen analysis.

[00:07:29] Um what if motility is the problem? So I look at in my poker analogy of the hand, if everything looks good but the motility is low, I think of short-term toxins. So um not severe um severity. So things like uh exposures, so medications. Um I think about habits, pot, smoking, hot baths. I think about behaviors, lifestyle. I think about so so I look for an exposure in that individual basically picked up on the history varicus and exposure um things like that and if the count's down and the motility is down it's I think of a more severe exposure so it's you know there's a there's royal flushes and there's four of a kind there's two of a kind so I would think of more of so I my goal when I see that seam analysis and see that patient is to figure out if he's not normal why and by the Do you get that analysis the day he's in the clinic with you or is that something you follow up on an appointment with? Pretty much have it in my hand when I see them.

[00:08:35] Either they give it to me or I get one, I want that there cuz that's when I look at them, I'd like to have that in front of me to say, "What kind of poker hand are you playing?" And this is something that's standardized and automated through micro micrfluidics. How is the how is the assay actually done? So the guy ejaculates in a cup, takes it to a lab.

[00:08:53] Oh, I mean, so it used to be done manually. Okay. And now it's done with hemocytometers and it's done with machines. Computer assisted semen analysis does most of them in IVF groups. So it's it's really standardized. Oh yeah. I like the you know I like the bespoke suit. So I like the handmade se. So when I have mine repeated I usually have someone do it by hand because there's observations I like which is hey you know what 1% morphology but all the others look like this. Mhm.

[00:09:21] Those comments are incredibly valuable that you don't really get from a computer assisted seam analysis, but it's faster and you don't have a lot of human effort involved with a computer. And are they using AI for this yet? Yeah, I mean some people are for sperm sperm selection a little bit, but yeah, there's a lot of stuff to help out and now will be really helpful for morphology to standardize it because one man in Krueger in South Africa correlated bad sperm shape with IVF outcomes and did not find that they were good when the sperm looked bad. That's where the 4% came from. But it's really hard to do that every time and do it well cuz it's so hard to do. Well, hoping AI, machine learning can help standardize the look cuz sperm, you know, it's just it's hard. Yeah. Given how good AI is at image recognition, this should be this should be like this should be a one foot putt. Yeah.
