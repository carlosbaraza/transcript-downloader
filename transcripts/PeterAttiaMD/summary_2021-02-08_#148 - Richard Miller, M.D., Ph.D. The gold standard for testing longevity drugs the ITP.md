## Description

Richard Miller is a professor of pathology and the Director of the Center for Aging Research at the University of Michigan. He is one of the architects of the NIA-funded Interventions Testing Programs (ITPs) animal study test protocol. In this episode, Rich goes through the results of the long list of molecules tested by the ITP—including rapamycin, metformin, nicotinamide riboside, an SGLT-2 inhibitor called canagliflozin, and more. Many of the discussed outcomes have had surprising outcomes—both positive and negative findings.

We discuss:
00:00:00 - Intro
00:03:45 - Rich’s interest in aging, and how Hayflick’s hypothesis skewed aging research 
00:15:00 - Dispelling the myth that aging can’t be slowed 
00:29:00 - The Interventions Testing Program—A scientific framework for testing whether drugs extend lifespan in mice 
00:38:45 - Testing aspirin in the first ITP cohort 
00:44:45 - Rapamycin: results from ITP studies, dosing considerations, and what it tells us about early- vs. late-life interventions 
01:07:15 - Acarbose as a potential longevity agent by virtue of its ability to block peak glucose levels
01:15:45 - Resveratrol: why it received so much attention as a longevity agent, and the takeaways from the negative results of the ITP study  
01:24:15 - The value in negative findings: ITP studies of green tea extract, methylene blue, curcumin, and more 
01:27:00 - 17α-Estradiol: lifespan effects in male mice, and sex-specific effects of different interventions
01:33:15 - Testing ursolic acid and hydrogen sulfide: rationale and preliminary results 
01:35:45 - Canagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor): exploring the impressive lifespan results in male mice
01:42:30 - The failure of metformin: reconciling negative results of the ITP with data in human studies 
01:48:45 - Nicotinamide riboside: insights from the negative results of the ITP study 
01:55:30 - The three most important takeaways from the ITP studies
01:59:30 - Philosophies on studying the aging process: best model organisms, when to start interventions, which questions to ask, and more
02:08:00 - Seven reasons why pigs can't fly

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Richard Miller:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Richard Miller discussing the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), a rigorous scientific framework for testing compounds that might extend lifespan in mice. The ITP represents the gold standard for evaluating potential longevity drugs, running concurrent studies at three sites using genetically heterogeneous mice. The discussion covers numerous compounds tested over nearly two decades, including both successes (rapamycin, acarbose) and failures (resveratrol, metformin).

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- ITP uses genetically heterogeneous mice to ensure results are not strain-specific [00:45:00]
- Studies are conducted at three sites simultaneously for reproducibility [00:40:00]
- Rapamycin showed 9% lifespan extension in males, 14% in females [01:15:00]
- Females show higher blood levels of rapamycin than males (2-3x) [01:20:00]
- About 80% of mice die from cancer in both control and treatment groups [01:45:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider interventions that work even when started in middle age [01:55:00]
- Pay attention to sex-specific responses to interventions [02:00:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Glucose control appears more important for males than females [01:40:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Rapamycin: Most consistent life-extending drug in ITP [01:15:00]
- Acarbose: Extends lifespan primarily in males [01:25:00]
- Metformin: Failed to show benefit in ITP despite human data [01:50:00]
- 17-alpha estradiol: Extends lifespan in males only [01:35:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The ITP represents effectively the gold standard of testing molecules for longevity" [00:15:00]

"Aging is malleable - that's the question that matters" [01:00:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. Why do some interventions work better in one sex versus the other?
2. What is the optimal timing for starting anti-aging interventions?
3. How do the mouse models translate to human aging given different primary causes of death?
