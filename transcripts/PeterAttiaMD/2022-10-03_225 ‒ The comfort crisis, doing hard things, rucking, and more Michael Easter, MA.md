Michael Easter is the author of the bestseller, The Comfort Crisis. He’s also a journalist, Professor of Journalism at UNLV, and a leading voice on how humans can integrate modern science and evolutionary wisdom for improved health, meaning, and performance in life and at work. In this episode, Michael first talks about his upbringing, including his parents' struggle with alcoholism, his father leaving when he was young, and how these things impacted Michael's own struggle with alcoholism. He explains what led to his realization that we are in a “crisis of comfort” and how the removal of many of life’s discomforts through advancements in modern society may actually be a leading contributor to many of our most urgent physical and mental health issues. He explains the benefits of challenging oneself and the immense positive carryover which can come from doing things we find difficult. He describes the consequences of technology like smartphones, which have effectively eliminated boredom—a discomfort that comes with many benefits. He tells the story of a profound experience at an elk hunt that changed Michael’s thoughts around life and death, how happiness can thrive in places without all of the modern comforts of the West, and why we’re hardwired for stress and what to do about it. They conclude with a conversation around rucking, an activity with many physical and mental benefits.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] michael so awesome to be sitting with you here today i have been uh looking forward to this podcast for probably about three or four months um and i appreciate you making the trek out here to do this in person absolutely likewise peter i've been looking forward to this one should be fun um my wife by the way i just want you to know called me like an hour ago to give me a ton of crap for the fact that we're not recording this outside in 107 degrees here today she's like you guys talking about the comfort crisis in your air-conditioned studio here what so she she's kind of called us out on the fact called me out on this fact well she's not wrong yeah i did think about that i was like it might be interesting if we actually did this while rocking but here we are we'll rock afterwards it'll be fine we'll survive and she was like i mean she wants to rock with us later today which we will but she was mostly like really you should at least be just sitting outside doing this in the sweltering heat and you know all that stuff and so maybe she's right i mean we're definitely way too comfortable right now there's going to be a weight penalty for our behavior with the rucks if we were playing in 40 no it's now 50. yeah 55. so that's how we'll we'll compensate it'll all shake out in the end so look people have heard me kind of talk a little bit about your book on previous podcasts um people have also heard me allude to this obsession of mine in wrecking certainly anybody who knows me personally is it's they're they're they're either converted or sick and tired of me uh and my daughter who just got back from her first sleep away camp in colorado and wyoming so she was first time 13 gone away for two weeks and you know this was a hard camp you know we sent her to a place deliberately because of how hard this place was and it's basically a camper you go to work so they're you know taking care of animals you know doing a bunch of hard stuff and so in prep for this we said look olivia um you really ought to just rock with me all the time because it will make it easier for you to go and she just kind of didn't really want to i mean i think when you're a 13 year old kid the idea of going for a heavy weighted backpack walk with your dad at five o'clock in the sweltering austin heat is not that appealing the whole time she's there you know they have no electronics you get one time to speak with them you get a 10 minute call at the middle of the thing so the first thing she said on that middle of the thing she goes dad i'm like the fastest hiker here all that wrecking totally paid off i love this yeah i could not love this anymore this is so cool to hear because they were at like 10 to 12 000 feet so you know okay they're at altitude and you know i i was having her out there with 25 to 30 pounds in her pack very cool and we have a lot of hills here as you'll see later today so it was it was good for her i also love that you sent her to a camp where she's doing hard things yep outside it's a theme that runs through my book as you know that is so valuable for kids today i mean so i teach at unlv and seeing a lot of the students that come in where they're at psychologically and sort of how embedded they are in i would say digital worlds and in their own head and how things that i think most people would consider maybe minor inconveniences in life can be so easily blown up i think that ties back to a lot of what i'm talking about in the book and i think the antidote to that is sending kids out when they are younger trying to introduce hard things into their life and there's obviously a lot of different ways to do that but it sounds like what you did is a is a really cool thing i mean it's certainly one way to do it and and we we had friends that recommended this place when we reached out to friends who had older kids to say hey where are places you can send kids i mean our actual initial hope is to center kind of a missionary camp where you could really sort of see something challenging in africa and things like that um a lot of times they just you know for kids this age we're not necessarily looking for that but let's take a step back and kind of you know just help folks understand a little bit about you remind me where you grew up i grew up in northern utah so a little town called bountiful just outside of salt lake city okay um were you a skier what was your main i like to say that snowboarding got me into college because when i was in high school i was not a great student i like to go out i like to party i was into girls i was into cars i was into all that kind of thing didn't really care about school work now would never do homework did okay in school but with park city mountain resort they would sell you a season pass for 99 if you got on the honor roll that is the only thing that incentivizes me to do any good at school so thank you park city uh ski resort that is what got me into college yeah so you mentioned your did your parents split when you were young they did so my well i wasn't even born yet so my mother was pregnant five months pregnant and my dad took off so their backstory which i think is relevant to understanding the context is that my dad was always a heavy drinker heavy drug user when my parents met my mom was into that lifestyle too so eventually my dad realizes you know maybe i'm a little too into this world so he goes to rehab now as part of his rehab i'm sorry this is after you've been after you're born this is before i'm born okay yeah so they were married at the time um they'd been married a few years so as part of his rehab uh they give my mother the book that he is supposed to read in rehab and they say you read this so you understand what he's going through is it 12 step uh it was okay yep so she she goes okay and one night as she explains it she goes so i'm sitting in the tub one night and i'm drinking a gin and tonic and i get to this line in this book and it says try to drink and stop try it twice and she goes oh yeah i couldn't do that so she realizes that she has a problem too and she manages to get sober so that's that's the joke because my dad went to rehab and my mom got sober and so they got back together he stayed sober for a little while you know a little bit just enough for her to get pregnant and once she got pregnant it was you know there's you don't have a drinking buddy anymore the fun's over and i think he wasn't quite ready for that so he took off and my mom raised me always been raised by a single parent um do you have a relationship with your dad today i do not i haven't heard from him for oh man since i was like eight or something like that yeah so given you know you how much of this history of your parents drinking did you know as you got into high school and stuff i knew my mom didn't drink and i knew the reason why she didn't drink now she was very respectful of my dad she wasn't going to give me any sort of details but i was left to assume that the reason that he was not in my life is because he didn't ever stop drinking so that was sort of the context around that so when you get to high school and most kids are even though not you know sort of legally allowed to drink but obviously that's when kids are most experimenting with alcohol did your mom have any advice for you or did you have any thoughts about you know i i'm born from two parents who both have probably suffered a little bit from this i could certainly have a genetic predisposition yeah so when i was a kid my plan was i'm never gonna drink because of that genetic predisposition and i read books i was kind of a nerdy kid and then you turn into a teenager and your brain starts changing and you look for excitement and risk and all of a sudden the pull of social things becomes so much more rewarding than it ever was that i drank and when that happened my response was why the hell would you not do this right that was the answer because the town that i grew up in uh i was it was all one religion except all mormon presumably all mormon yes and we were not mormon um single parent so a little bit of an outcast in that sense you know it didn't have a dad around and so i think you kind of you're kind of trying to figure it out you know you're you're uncomfortable in these situations around people just just generally and then you have a drink and all of a sudden that goes away so it becomes this sort of learned thing where you associate this with with good things all of a sudden i could talk to anyone i could talk to girls i could say funnier things it was a lot more clever right so you get all this positive feedback and why would you not drink right now that eventually worked for me until it stopped working that's sort of the the classic story so today i'm you know i'm sober and there's a good reason for that and i'm glad i am saved my life yeah so talk to me about the um the kind of realization that this isn't working for me um you know they talk about how change happens really slowly and then really quickly um and and so what was the slow descent into the quick realization and how many how many not everybody just has a one realization where they hit rock bottom and they switch sometimes you have to bounce a little bit yeah on the bottom 100 i would say that i would uh i'd always noticed that i probably drank a little more than other people at the same time there were no real repercussions for that until i was maybe 23 or 24 i was living in new york city i was going to grad school i was living alone and i had no one watching me and i had bars that closed at 4am and that's a potent combination and i think that was when i started to realize oh like maybe this isn't good and i remember i i i remember exactly when i sort of realized it as i went uh went on the internet like you do consulted dr google and you know signs you have a drinking problem and it's like these 10 questions or whatever it was it's like i'm going yes to that one no to that one yes to that one no to that one yes yes and i go oh five or six out of ten i should be fine it gets to the bottom if you have answered yes to one or more do one or more you know i just go uh-oh so that's when it gets on your radar and i think i told myself well i'll just quit when it gets bad enough once i reach eight out of ten then i'm stopping yes exactly so then you just start racking them up over the years and for me you know i had tried to stop drinking probably probably started trying to stop when i was about 25 in different ways and it never worked just never worked and why why is that i mean i'm sure you are not the first person to come to that realization of just willpower alone without maybe a broader system or structure or awareness is is tough why why do you think that's the case i think there's a lot of things behind it uh i think some of them are developmental most people tend to get about half of people end up getting sober around age 30. so i think certain things the same things that are happening in the brain that draw a teenager towards alcohol and make it this great association they start to kind of shake out over time right you you take on responsibility you have all these other things in your life that all of a sudden make that you start to realize maybe this isn't as good for me i also think that eventually the balance just tips where the short-term relief just doesn't isn't as good as what this long-term thing could be and i think that coming to that realization takes a long time like you said a lot of bouncing and for me it was just one morning i woke up i was living in uh pennsylvania i was working at a magazine that was based out of there we had an office in uh new york but our editorial office was in pennsylvania and i woke up and my house is a mess i'm a mess i'd had morning how old i was 28 years old and i'd had mornings like that before and for whatever reason this morning it was like you could kind of see where this path was going and it was very clear to me that if i were to continue this drinking i was going to die early now whether it was 35 55 75 i didn't know i just knew that it was going to be earlier and tell me about your relationship with your mom at this point does she understand how much you're drinking is she no so i always hid that from her we've always been very close um you know we were always a team yeah yeah and so i kept that away from her she would travel when i was a kid and in high school so i would even only drink when she was out of town she was gone about a third of the year so even things like behaviors like that i just didn't want her to know and sort of and it's interesting when you kind of contemplated um getting sober did it occur to you that your mom could be the most important ally in that given that she knew what it was like as well well i think that so the morning where things became more clear to me she's the first person i called right i had told people so now you're telling her two things which is i'm getting sober the implication of which is i'm an alcoholic yeah which you didn't know that yeah yeah uh yeah exactly that was a phone call she didn't want to take but was happy to take right and uh i could also see that so i could see this one path would lead in an early death probably and more importantly it was like you're going to lose everything in the process you know at the time i had a girlfriend who i really loved and i was starting to realize like oh this is a this is a really good person for me we're now married uh what did she think of your drinking is she aware of it fully or yeah yeah she's like you got like you got to get a handle on this she basically put it you're a really good cool dude when you're sober but you start drinking and you're obnoxious and i was you know and i knew it too but once you get in that cycle it's like if you're if you drink like i did it was well if one's good two's better three's even better four's even but just keep stacking them on you know and so once you start drinking something happens in your brain where all of a sudden just your entire thinking and universe i mean this is you know i i have such empathy for someone who's gone through this but i can't actually relate to it because um you know we are all wired kind of differently right and i don't have that chemistry in my brain alcohol doesn't do it for me which is not to say i don't like to drink i love certain types of tequila and wine and there's even one beer i like um but i can never recall like feeling what you're feeling though intellectually i can understand what you're saying and i can only imagine how difficult that is because it becomes a reinforcement loop and those can be very difficult to break yeah the problem is the solution is the problem is the solution yeah right so that becomes a challenge and where was i well basically the other path is that i could see you know this is gonna be hard it's gonna be very uncomfortable i'm gonna have to relearn everything i don't know if i can do it but i'm gonna try this thing and you know i'd gone through stints where maybe i wouldn't drink for a few weeks but i was like i'm gonna take action and taking action was picking up the phone and calling my mom and then did your mom suggest the 12-step program she she suggested that i talk to people who were similar to us yeah so i started becoming active and just meeting other people who were sober you know and having to a big part of it for me which i think is one of the reasons why this book came about is that i had to realize like i don't have to be comfortable all the time you know because alcohol is the ultimate comfort blanket for me if i had stress from work it became this really learned behavior where if i just had a drink then problem's gone but that ultimately was backfiring on me over time like in a very severe way how many of your friendships were sort of predicated around alcohol consumption and therefore once alcohol was gone those friendships didn't make a lot of sense that's a great question there's a few that they stuck around i have some really good friends who i remember i got to sober i got sober on december 15th and i had planned to hang out with a friend on new year's eve who was kind of my drinking buddy and i had to call him and be like hey man like not drinking this weekend he's like oh i don't care we can just go golf or something and it was just like oh what a relief like yeah like that dude i owe him a lot um but then some it's like you just realize you don't have as much in common with them after the it's not so much the drinking as it is you only have this one thing in common and so once that thing goes away it's like oh well cool this was fun hanging out we're probably not going to call each other again and that's okay to me that's like the subtle part of this that's really complicated and i may have told the story previously on a podcast but i can't recall um and when i was doing my residency in baltimore um you know at the time it was certainly the heroin capital of the united states now i don't know if that's still the case and you know opioids have expanded far beyond heroin but we definitely took care of i mean just it's almost like everybody that walked in the er with an abscess in their arm or something like that was addicted to heroin and you know the best advice i could ever offer though it was not particularly helpful i mean it was it was intellectually true but like i don't know how you act on it was listen you're gonna die from this like it didn't kill you this time you had a huge abscess that i cut open and drained and pulled old needles out of and you're really lucky to be alive and you're going to be on iv antibiotics for a few days and then oral antibiotics for a lot longer you only get a few more of these and it's that's going to be the last one um but i realize you can't just leave here and go back to the row home you're living in with all the people that are doing that same thing and expect to stop yeah so if you want to quit heroin you need a whole new group of people to be with that's that's just such a devastating thing to contemplate when your entire life is centered around this block of baltimore where everybody is using and you know some doc is saying look this is going to kill you um but it's not just that you need to stop this thing that is the ultimate comfort blanket it's that you need a whole new social you need a whole new social group you need to be around people that don't do this yeah exactly and that i mean that place that's just devastating yeah and it plays out in the research you look at research on alcoholics and i think there was a group that tracked alcoholics who you know at day one of the recovery for a year and the people who still stuck around their normal friend group only 15 of them were still sober after a year i'm amazed it's that high truthful the group that got a totally like stop hanging out with those people started hanging out with different people sixty percent of them were sober so it seems to me that your wife being sober is a i mean i don't know i mean it doesn't sound like she became sober in the sense that she was but the fact that your wife was not a big drinker yeah is probably the single biggest factor in your life i'm guessing super helpful yeah very helpful i mean i i know it's definitely harder for people who have a significant other who is continuing to drink hopefully a lot harder because you're around that all the time probably the conditions that maybe led to some of your drinking haven't changed at all and you know it almost becomes an illogical decision not to drink sometimes in the short term you know because for someone who has an addiction using the substance is a relatively rational decision in the short term totally you know yeah but it's completely adaptive not only adaptive in the long term yeah so you know how did you think about that issue which was okay i have this adaptation that serves me well in the short term not serving me in the long term um but what's the adaptation for you know how much of this is related to your abandonment as a child by your father and did you know because one could say that that's the potential root of this coupled with the genetic predisposition right so you have these which is kind of the way things work in life right you have sort of an environmental and a um you know uh genetic component to something did you at the time think i i should also probably figure out like how much of this is driven by that feeling or that that that that vacancy i would say early on you're just trying to figure it out day to day you're just trying to not drink you're just trying to make the next right decision i think you start to unpeel that onion over time and it's something that takes a long time you know and everyone has their own onion whatever it is that needs that unpeeling and just like with a real onion sometimes you cry during it but it's the right thing to do yeah so the magazine you're working out at that time what do you what's your what's the what are the kind of stuff you're writing about so i was mainly in fitness and nutrition and performance i did some mental health stuff so all kinds of different articles i was running basically all the fitness coverage for men's health is what the magazine was and which is how we met originally wasn't it i think it was i feel like you interviewed me a couple of years ago yeah on on something that was related like a men's health piece i don't remember what it was about but yeah i think bill gifford introduced us right yeah i think it was him because he his background is with men's health right yep so bill introduced us and yeah i worked there for six or seven years and that's where i was working at at the time so where did you get this idea that we are in a crisis of comfort a few things happen so one is that working at that magazine i noticed that every single thing that i was writing about because i mainly am working on lifestyle health performance fitness nutrition that kind of stuff mental health i noticed that anything that i'm writing about you have to go through short-term discomfort in order to improve if you want to get fit you're going to have to exercise harder than you are now if you're not if you want to lose weight you're probably going to be hungry at some point if you want to improve your mental health just like i experienced you might have to ask yourself some hard questions about why do i feel this way what's happening what's the underlying behavior and motivation and that's not always comfortable so i make that observation then i get sober which is the ultimate yeah that was really really hard and what year was this december of 2014 okay yeah 2014. that was exceedingly hard but after things sort of started to settle after you're done with the white knuckling how long is the white knuckling for me i would say there were times it was probably shorter than for some people because i think i was just done psychologically like it was sort of like okay but part of the white knuckling i'm sure is also just the physiology right you're really giving up something that yeah so you're having to relearn all these behaviors which is really tough and figure out how to deal with things um but soon like literally everything in my life got better everything you could measure got better your performance got better performances my writing got better my finances got better i lost weight all these things uh but more importantly i would say internally is where the change really was i mean i was just like wow like things have changed let's keep this energy going and i got that from being willing to sort of step into the fire to enter the cave that was the one that i feared right so that sets the stage for this idea that okay going through discomfort often leads to something really good and in the long term it's a necessary buy-in for change and i kind of start thinking about this idea of comfort and make some observations like well wow you know what life is pretty comfortable in a lot of different ways now and then what sort of really brought the idea that would ultimately become the book together is i do this back country hunt with donnie vincent who's this backcountry bowhunter filmmaker and i profiled him for men's health magazine so we go on this elk hunt he was up there for maybe two weeks we were in uh nevada up in the mountains and i was only with him for maybe five days or something like that but you know it's a backpack hunt so and what led you to want to do the profile on donnie i came across a youtube video of his and it's called who we are and i think that i had always been interested in the outdoors somewhat i'd always had i've kind of been interested in hunting and i think part of that goes back to maybe my father so his profession is a hunting and fishing guide so i just kind of had this interest in it you know it's like a thing that was on my radar because of that and but i had never really come across material around hunting that really spoke to me you know when you turn on the sportsman's channel it is if you've ever watched the sportsman's channel it's the sportsman's channel right um and donnie talked about hunting in a totally different way totally different way it would i mean he i like to describe him as being part locavore part naturalist part environmentalist part conservationist part ultra athlete and which is funny because that's the way i was introduced to it so that's the only thing i can relate to which is why i don't think i know what's happening on the sportsman's channel or whatever it's called like i you know for better or worse like i just my only exposure to hunting it sounds like came about through the same way that donny i've read you know what you've written about him so i thought that was interesting and i thought that he was talking about it in an interesting way and i thought there was a lot of things you know knowing what i knew um in the health space i thought there's a lot of different things that are probably happening around this that are good so i joined him on this hunt and we backpack in up to like 11 000 feet and i'm freezing cold the time this is an elk hunt so this is september october september and i'd come from vegas where it was 100 something and we get up to these super high peaks and it's freezing cold at night and yeah i didn't pack well enough let's just say that i'm sleeping in the dirt starving the entire time because you're on public land we're on public land we're only packing in so much food because you don't want to carry that around getting water requires that we hike down to this stream hoof it up sitting in in the afternoon sort of glassing it's very boring yeah because most people don't understand that you're you really only can shoot the elk at dawn and dusk the rest of the day you're just doing recon i had no idea had i known that i might have brought a crossword puzzle but instead i'm just sitting there going hmm you know looking around and it's like oh all of a sudden i'm bored again um on and on and during the five days did he get an elk he got one right after i left yeah so i didn't get to see that but also the the underlying sense is we got really close to one it was just a little too young for him so we got within oh like 40 yards and this thing didn't see us and it was just like i mean i was just saucer right oh my god that thing is huge you know they're they're a magnificent creature it was unbelievable to see it that close and in the wild and what ended up happening is we we got in really close and a coyote came in because he's waiting for don like he understands oh this guy's going to kill and i'm going to have dinner too so that elk spooks and takes off but i get back home to las vegas and i feel great like man i haven't felt this good since i was like just got sober when you're riding that pink cloud off into the sunset man you know and it occurred to me you kind of have this moment where you're like man the world i'm in now is so different than the world i was in up there and it's different because this is comfortable in every way and that has it was uncomfortable in almost every way and yet that yeah why did that feel better right it doesn't make sense right and yet that world is the one that humans lived in for pretty much all time 99.999 of our genetic evolution yes so you go whoa well that's interesting now we've had this very very rapid tip into comfort so you start to look at start to look at all the things that most impact my daily life i couldn't live in las vegas not for air conditioning i drive to work as i stream entertainment from my xm radio right uh i don't have to be alone with my thoughts i have this easy you don't have to hunt or gather any of your food no i don't have to work for any of my food my food is also exceedingly calorie dense if i want it to be i can eat it anytime there's an abundance of it on and on and on and so i just wonder okay well how are all these other comforts affecting us right have we almost become too comfortable and what happens if you sort of push back against this and i guess what are the key types of discomfort that we evolved to face and do those still help us today so there's the question and that ultimately led to me going well that's a lot of material this doesn't sound like a magazine article it sounds like a book so you write the book proposal and we shopped it out and it's funny because this whole process uh you know you have a book agent and stuff and they're going well this is a really good idea and i think i'd like to read it but i don't i don't know what the hell it is like what what section does it go in right because when you read the way that i tell the book which we'll get into is i did this 33-day trip in the alaskan arctic and that is the overarching narrative of the book and as i'm facing these important discomforts that humans used to face in the past that can still be beneficial to us now that our world is comfortable i spend chapters on those so i'm kind of weaving the stories in and out and it was kind of a confusing thing for them to wrap their heads around they're going is this in the adventure section is it self-help is it like what is it but we took it out and luckily someone was like well i think i can probably do something with it too so i i love the way it's written um and as you know i gave it to my daughter and i love that yeah yeah nothing makes me happier yeah yeah so um of all the well and we're gonna go into each of these in some depth but i'll tell you the one that nagged at me the most because most of these discomforts i've thought a lot about right and i've um but the one that i don't think i'd really given its due to was boredom in some ways that's the most insidious comfort we've cured yes um i love the way you talk about it right because it basically we you know i think you say sort of like in the 1950s television no no no so go back 1920s radio right so that's the first time you've got this external source of input that you can kind of numb your boredom with which is passive rather than active i think that's a part of it as well right so you could have read before then but reading's not really boring you know uh reading is not necessarily the same type of a remedy um and then we talk about televisions in the 1950s and the 1960s but i love what you describe is what is it june 29 2007 is the death of boredom yes the advent of the iphone and i think that that shifts so if you sort of back up and look at how much time people spend engaged with digital media today when i wrote the book the average was 11 hours and six minutes it's now past 12 hours yeah so so i had my team look at this because i'm like this can't be right like i said first of all that must include working at the computer right does it i i think it might end i've always that's been a question in my mind as well yeah but when you look at cell phone usage it's up to like three average hours television television i will say this television is the most dominant at capturing our attention and and how much of that is the tv is on while i'm cooking but i'm not watching it because i when i go through these numbers i'm there's one of two possibilities one is i am so out of touch with how the world lives or it's capturing things that aren't direct right like because i've seen that i've looked at these data where it's like 12 hours and yeah tv's the biggest chunk and smartphone and computer and and stuff like that and i'm thinking like if i could watch six hours of tv in a week that would be a big week of tv and that's only during a week when there's a formula one race right right like it's not it's i it wouldn't be on a regular or a non-f1 week um so how is the average person watching four hours of tv a day or whatever it is i think it's definitely possible because think about the data from netflix when they release a new series something like thousands upon thousands of people will binge 12 episodes in a weekend i mean that's so i guess you're right i just so netflix they like i binge watched um ozark yeah because you know and i was i'm lucky i was able to do that because it can't you know how they they missed a couple of years like that would have driven me nuts i liked that i could just kind of watch it you did it right i did it right but i don't think i ever watched more than two episodes in a day and there were lots of days i didn't watch it so when i say binged i mean i took like three months to watch it but that felt like a lot when netflix really so netflix went all in when they were trying to go to streaming they went all in financing house of cards and sort of as a random thing the decision that gets made and who the hell made it and they don't know why they go yeah let's just put it all up at once some crazy number of people binged the show all of it all of it and they go oh what's this about that's when binging that's when binging show starts so it's kind of this random decision made by someone probably just kind of a coin flip yeah let's i guess let's just put it all up at once the thing that i've been paying most attention to [Music] is the phone and what i've realized is like if i compare myself to now versus pre blackberry so um i didn't get the first gen iphone in 2007. uh or i got it and then i returned it after a week because i thought it sucked but i only cared about email right so i was like kind of in the work mode of like ema and the email wasn't that good and the phone wasn't that good like it wasn't actually a good telephone it dropped calls like the blackberry was still the gold standard but when i think about what life was like before that and i'm old enough to remember there's a lot of time when you just like you wouldn't you wouldn't think to be sitting on the toilet looking at your phone right whereas now it's like yeah i'm pretty much always reading the news yeah yep guilty as well and it's like that is so weird how if you think about something as silly as sitting on the toilet right like you're not there for that long do you really need to be doing anything else right so i started thinking about the idea of boredom from hunting as we talked about that it's a lot of sitting on a hill and looking for animals so we're when we are in the people don't understand how sparse animals are i think people have this view of like hunting is getting out of the back of a truck into a pen of animals and shooting them like they can't fathom what it actually means to scour 20 000 acres for an animal yeah and i think people think it's action-packed that you're always like you're always on the move and running it's like no it is 99.99999 extreme boredom and one point you know zero zero zero zero zero one percent pure panic yes exactly that's a great way to describe it so we would sit on these hills because we're timing our hunt to the cariboo migration we're hunting caribou so we're waiting for these oh so you're now in the alaska so we're in alaska now yeah and so we're waiting for these animals to come through now this just wasn't happening so five days in a row not seeing anything going well they should be coming through here it's not happening and i didn't bring a cell phone of course i'm not bringing books magazines all that stuff and it's like i love the stuff that you read oh dude so to entertain ourselves we read the labels on our food so i can tell you a clif bar has 250 calories 6 grams of fat 49 carbs 10 grams of protein right like these are the things you're getting and you know what kind of carbs too yes uh you're reading all the labels i'm coming up with you know who made your clothing right wasn't it hung yeah some guy named hong yeah yeah my kafaru bag some guy named hong [Laughter] and i'm coming up with christmas shopping lists for like the next six years did you bring a journal i brought one of the uh right in the rain notebooks that i bring on any journalistic assignment yeah so that also led to okay well you know each thing becomes boring eventually clif bar reading becomes boring learning about hong becomes boring so then i go okay well i'll come up with some ideas for the magazines i write for i come up with like 17 different ideas and they're all like very good i start writing some of the book so this leads me to sort of a point about boredom which is that boredom is an evolutionary discomfort that basically tells us whatever you're doing with your time the return on your time invested has worn thin so if you and i are you know it's a million years ago you and i are hunting we need food we're gonna die we're gonna starve for hunting and no animals are coming through boredom is going to kick on and it's going to tell us go do something else and then we might go pick potatoes or pick berries whatever it might be right so boredom tells us do something and in the past that something it used to be productive it used to often move our lives forward in a way well now when we feel this evolutionary discomfort of boredom we have very easy very effortless escapes from it right you just pull out your cell phone we have like the ultimate vehicle for stimulation and attention capture on our persons at all time right so it has really put a big dent in boredom and boredom does come with benefits so there's these really interesting studies around boredom and creativity and they're like totally hilarious too is that they'll take one group of people and they'll let them do you know whatever they want put them in a room and like people bought their cell phones or whatever they'll take another group and they will bore the hell out of these people and then they'll give them a creativity test and the board group always comes up with more more creative answers than the non-board group and i think it also gives your brain time to sort of process information in the background let things sort of happen so when you think about the sort of cliche of you get your best ideas in the shower well it's a cliche for a reason it's because when we're focused outwardly on the outside world like in a screen our phone netflix even this conversation your brain's working hard to process that information so it's kind of a work mode when you have these moments of boredom you tend to go inside for a little while as you figure out what to do you kind of have some weird funky thoughts and that's kind of more like a rest mode for your brain i call it unfocused mode in the book and that tends to sort of give your brain a little bit of time to rest and from that seems to come good things now one of the researchers i talk to he goes look boredom is neither good nor bad it really isn't it's it's how you it's what you do with it and so what we do with it now i think is increasingly becoming something that maybe isn't moving our lives forward so what i'm arguing in the book is i'm not saying you know burn your cell phone and you know go back to a flip phone or any of that but i am saying that i think we need to think about putting more boredom back into our lives because a lot of times there's so much talk around how we need to reduce our phone screen time like reduce your phone screen time reduce your phone screen time and i think that's a good thing but what tends to happen to people is they go okay i took an hour off my iphone screen time well now what do i do so they watch an hour on netflix well your brain doesn't know the difference right so i think it's it's better to have time where you're just sort of unstimulated so something that i'll do in my own life is just go for a walk every day at least 20 minutes and just don't take your phone and just kind of let your mind do what it needs to do that also gets you out into nature which has its own benefits i'm sure we'll get into well that's that's you know we're going to talk about wrecking a lot and so this will be the you know one of many but some something that i really and i always talk about this one of my friends when i'm getting them into it it's like oh and by the way you don't bring your phone you're not listening to a podcast and you're not listening to music like the whole key to this thing is going without the phone so that all you're hearing you know we're lucky here we get to do it and we're not hearing like we're not on a road that's busy with a bunch of cars going past it so you're mostly just kind of listening to the wind um but you know wherever you are you're you you have to get into that zone of not being with the phone which for me was also like i'm the king of efficiency yes you know i'm always listening to an audio book or a podcast or i'm on a phone call like if i'm moving those things are happening yes there is never a time when one of those three things is not happening i was totally the same way and i started digging into this research and it really changed how i thought about it and i do think that i tend to get a lot better ideas my mind goes to more interesting places that it maybe needs to go when i am disconnected and don't bring that phone along that's ultimately gonna sort of capture more attention going back to the hunting thing i i find it takes two days for me on a hunt to find my senses um we were talking a little bit about this before we started the podcast you know one of the reasons i like axis deer so much not only is it you know just from an environmental standpoint it's you know you're doing something very positive for the environment um the meat itself is incredibly healthy tastes great but the challenge of hunting that animal is so high right it's just you know if you can shoot an access deer with a bow you have earned that animal um and the reason for that is they have really good senses like their sense of hearing their sense of smell it's insane and so if you try to go and hunt them in a clumsy way where your senses aren't heightened it's a joke it's like they're they're toying with you right like they'll smell you a mile away they'll see you a mile away they'll hear you a mile away you're not going to get within their zip code you can only get up on them if you become as attuned to the wind as attuned visually to what's going on as attuned to every sound you're making and again i'm sure a guy like donnie can get in that zone in one second i need like a day or two and and again i like you don't have your phone with you you know you're not listening you don't have earbuds in as you're making this move um and i i remember each you know on almost every hunt i've been on i remember kind of what that transition feels like and getting there is hard like it is it is boring as hell it's totally boring but you have to kind of go through that for your senses to wake up at least for me yeah i mean i think two things one that's short and one that's long um i think that that's kind of a metaphor for the book as a whole is you have to go through that to get that benefit and i think there's a lot of different things that we've removed from our lives that going through can benefit us the second thing is that what you're saying it totally jives with not only my experience but there's this concept uh called the three-day effect and it basically shows that after three days in nature a lot of good things tend to happen to people so in the modern world your brain tends to ride what are called beta waves frenetic sort of go-go-go associated with sort of stress burnout and this sort of thing after your third day in nature brain tends to start to ride what are called alpha waves and these are found in experienced meditators they're like calm more focused more aware and you just feel like ah like i'm sure you felt it when you're out there when you first get into nature you're kind of to your point you're like what's going on you don't really feel in tune you're worried like did i put the garage down uh is this my you know my daughter have a ride to school that sort of thing once you get to day three it's like focus center like you just feel like like a zen monk or something right and i think there's a good reason for that there's a lot of things that are happening and this is why one reason why some researchers are thinking of extended time in nature as a way to help help people with ptsd specifically veterans because the benefits don't seem to wash off immediately so this idea of the three-day effect it's at the top of this concept that i write about in the book called the nature pyramid and it basically prescribes different amounts of time you should spend in different types of nature so this idea of three days and sort of more back country removed nature is at the pinnacle of this and it basically says we should try and hit that at least once a year [Music] you know i never really thought of it that way but that's you know as you know if you go on a hunting trip that's another thing people don't understand like if you're going out there to try to you know kill an elk or a deer like it's going to take you a week and like my first elk hunt seven days later i didn't have an elk yeah like that's not uncommon yeah not uncommon at all and i would i think most i mean the success i don't know what the success rate is it's maybe like 20 i would say for the average person it depends obviously but in public land it's really got to be pretty low yeah um you know you have to be like you have to be an exceptional hunter to to get an elk on public land yeah and i think another thing that people sometimes don't realize about hunting is that you're not hanging out on the trail going on the tr you know the crowded ground like you are embedded in the wilderness you are bushwhacking the entire time you're completely you can be completely off the grid like you are in it and i think that that's what makes hunting compelling to me is that rather than becoming sort of a a observer of nature you become a participant in it and i wasn't sure how i would feel about that to be honest so the first time i ever hunted big game was for this book and i definitely had my reservations but donny told me you know i think you'd understand why we go out there and do this thing if you were to actually hunt and so i trusted him on that and i can see the appeal yeah it's funny my my daughter again brought this up when she got back i've taken my daughter on one hunt with me when she was 10 or 11 and you know in retrospect i'm really glad i did and i don't know what i was thinking at the same time because like it's hard to see an animal die there's there's no way there's no getting around that like i i don't know maybe if you've done it you get numb to that but i don't think so even the most experienced hunters i know have a have a real respect for life and for you know what i describe as the carbon cycle like we're part of it too right like we're you know we're going to die and our carbon is going to go back into the earth and our nitrogen and it's going to fertilize something around us um so and of course the the one axis here she sees me shoot it's a disaster because i forgot literally i forgot my front stabilizer so you know we're booking it in at four in the morning right because you've got to be in position to try to see deer by like 5 30 to get a shot by you know 5 45 or whatever and i stupidly like just took the front stabilizer off my bow the night before something i would never do and i forgot to put it back on and we're an hour in and i realize i don't have it and i don't have a choice i if we go back we're done for that morning so i'm like i'm going to be shooting this thing without a front stabilizer i've never done that before it's doable but i've never done it before so to make a long story short i get a 47 yard shot at this axis deer and um i don't i don't hit my sweet spot which is like you're on an access deer it's not that big it's only about that big you've got to be able to get how much do they weigh um the biggest ones in hawaii are 200 to 220 pounds this one was probably 150 pounds yeah this one was not a monster um and instead i hit him in the neck but it hits his spinal cord because he just dropped immediately he was paralyzed so now we've got to run up and stick a knife into his heart to immediately kill him because you know on the one hand you could say well he doesn't feel anything but you could argue psychologically this is pretty traumatic so it's not just like she sees a clean kill like she actually sees a very messy kill how did she handle that um amazingly well um she got a little nauseous when i because every time i shoot an animal i also want to take its insides apart and so you're taking the meat off is one thing but i like to see the organs because i do think it really helps me to understand the anatomy well and i really like to see every detail of their anatomy over and over and over again plus we also eat the heart and some of the organs as well so i think when i when we got into me taking out the heart and doing all that stuff she was like i'm gonna stand back here for a minute but otherwise she did great and then of course what did we do like we took that deer back to our hotel because we were staying on another part of maui and uh ate it and and like shared it with everyone who worked at the hotel cool um so we befriended the chef and these are all people local to hawaii who know about what access deer do to their community how they destroy their farms and stuff like that and many of them had never even eaten an access deer wow and i was like well you're in for a treat tonight yeah and so the chef prepared it for us and for the whole staff like fed like 50 people i love that um so it was it was it was really fantastic um and again that was the point i was going i was going with this um i had a point oh i know so my daughter is at this camp that she just got back from and she's talking all about she's like well you know this counselor that counselor and she's like you know one of the counselors there was a vegan so for like a week i went vegan too and i was like oh what was that like and she's like well you know it was all right but you know probably not for me and i was like well and i was like so did the counselor tell you why she was vegan and um because i've sort of explained to my daughter that there are generally three reasons that people would associate with being vegan right they're sort of the uh like the animal rights reason sort of like and then there's kind of the environmental reason uh vis-a-vis kind of climate change and then there's kind of like the perceived health reason and i've talked to my daughter in detail about each of these right and and i just wanted to kind of understand i said so what was the rationale of the the counselor who you were in and she's like you know really for her it was around the treatment of animals and i was like yeah i mean i said like i really respect that and there's there's almost a part of me that thinks you shouldn't be able to eat meat unless you can kill it that doesn't mean you have to kill everything you're eating i'm not suggesting that because that gets pretty complicated but if you can't actually kill an animal psychologically maybe you should question whether you should be eating it that would be at least a discussion to have right and that's part of why i wanted my daughter to be able to see this so early in her life which was look anytime we're eating an animal you have to understand like that thing was alive what does that mean yeah um and so she my daughter was sharing with this counselor like her experience which is we eat elk and access deer like most days and she was like yeah you know this counselor was super impressed and and i was like that's a great sign like when when your vegan camp counselor is like very impressed that you're eating wild game and you know olivia was able to kind of explain the manner in which these things were killed i thought you know that's that's really cool to me yeah um and it gets back to your point which is it totally changes the dynamic of how you think about food 100 and you can and also makes you realize how easy is it to be able to use a sophisticated weapon like this and think about what our ancestors had to do think about what we were doing just a thousand years ago yes like i don't know if you can see it but right over there we won't be able to show it on screen that you see that bow on the wall oh yeah yeah so that a good friend of mine darren aronofsky was doing some filming for um a documentary he was producing and um this is i think these are some hunters in papua new guinea and that's what they hunt with like that is so he actually brought me back their act one of their actual bows and their actual arrows and you know out to 10 or 20 yards they'll kill an animal with that i was just in uh the bolivian amazon with uh the chimane trap and that's what they hunt with they do a lot of fishing they i'm like okay so how do you you know kill to peer what a tapper i don't know how you pronounce it some sort of yeah and they're just standing there and throwing like spears at them aren't they yeah and they've got they've got pose like that it's like oh my god and here's what you realize like whatever i will ever do or you will ever do or donnie will ever do it's still an enormous step forward in technology to be able to use a bow an actual compound or something like that 100 and it you know it's fascinating because when i when i kind of had my hesitations and was your hesitation around the act of taking a life i think that's ultimately what it was now my i told myself is because well your journalists and journalists don't get involved in the story so you're just there to cover it and i think that was kind of a mental workaround for me to not have to you know i wasn't sure how i felt about it but i don't know i mean i that seems like a reasonable point of view as well do you do not think that i could see that argument i can see the argument um but i think ultimately it was but it's a different experience it's a difference i don't think one's better than the other i just think like you could have been there watching donnie do it yeah and what was the other guy's name william right yeah um alternatively by doing it now you're you're writing about your experience i think that the i'm glad i trusted donnie let's just say that i think that the um the book ended up better i think specifically the section where i talk about death is a lot richer because of that i mean i feel like it is internally the experience of actually hunting the animal is you know i i told even when i said okay to donny i was like i don't have to do it you know i don't have to pull the trigger yep and he was he kind of told me that too he's like just plan on it but you don't have to yeah and he wasn't pushing me either direction but you know you buy a buy a tag which in alaska you can buy a caribou tag over the counter and go all the way out there carrying the rifle around for a couple weeks and we finally get in a position where um we're on this hill and there's a herd on the other side of this valley on a hill and you know donnie says if they keep eating their way down this hill they're going to probably come over this null so if we can get on the other side of the knoll we're going to be in a good position so when that happens we just we're on the move right we're kind of up and over the null we start cranking through the grass on the tundra and eventually we kind of get into an army crawl you know planning that these uh this herd is going to come over the hill and as we get in position you know it was it's like something out of planet earth where you're kind of watching this hill and then all of a sudden it's like the first thing you see are these hips these gigantic antlers that first and then it's like there's one and two and then eventually there are 30. they're all kind of coming and we're looking at them because we're only wanting to shoot something that's old and we had you know from the spotting scope we had thought okay there's probably two older ones in there but you know you want to be sure because we're super far away when we made that call how far were you when you guys made the first spot um it was pretty far i mean maybe a mile i mean it's a big valley and we eventually see in this herd that there's this really old bull that's that's limping and so still at that moment i'm going i got the rifle i'm in position i don't have to pull the trigger but when we saw that limping bull it was like okay it felt right and it was a tough process um to get the shot off because they're going in and out of the herd and you want a clean shot and you know donny at one point because they were maybe within 150 yards of us was going to be the closest point and i couldn't get them in the scope and they kind of kept going and donnie kind of looked at me and goes look if you don't have to take if you don't want to take the shot don't take the shot but but if you're going to take the shot you got to do it right this is when you got to do it you got to do it soon and right after that it's like the herd sort of parted it was right there just perfect shot pulled the trigger pulled it again heard ran bull fell and my initial reaction was oh my god like what have you done there's it was immediate regret to be honest and sadness yeah we come up on the animal and that didn't help things and uh what was really interesting though so i i had a lot of emotions around that and remind me what day of the hunt this was this was probably a couple weeks in yeah so we start breaking it down and all of a sudden that shifts the relationship there because you kind of go well wait a minute that's that's me you know donnie's like yeah that's why we're doing this that's why we're doing this um but you don't really understand that until you experience it and then it kind of occurs to me dude you eat meat all the time and you've never questioned it never questioned it you've never felt one iota of emotion and here you are now with this like a mess and not only that this animal that you just shot died more humanely and suffered less than anything you've ever eaten to your to date in your life a hundred percent lived out it's not even a comparison lived a beautiful traumatic life in nature which is what it is let's not romanticize nature but wasn't in a corral wasn't force-fed antibiotics and you know one of the things that i really love about this project we're doing in hawaii is and we've only i never appreciated this until i met jake muse was the stress that an animal is in in the final hours of its life impacts the food quality and even if you're eating the most she she grass fed organic cow make no mistake about it the final hour or two of that animal's life is very stressful as it goes through the process yeah yeah um and i believe it and it's totally different when an animal gets you know a bullet through it and dies within you know again and we're trying to make sure it's an instant death for the for that meat process yeah um there's there's no cortisol surging through it there's no lactic acid surging through it um so yeah what you did is actually about the most humane thing you could have offered that animal yeah relative to anything you've eaten but also given to what its natural history is like that's the other thing people have to understand like these old animals don't go to old animal folks homes no they don't have graceful exits either no he's gonna get he's gonna get killed by the other wolves he's gonna drown crossing rivers because when they make this right migration they have to do a bunch of river crossings it's gonna freeze to death they have a harder time they have a harder time getting food as they age so he's going to starve he's going to be killed by another caribou yeah yeah so it was really this really just a deep appreciation set in after that and sort of gratitude where you go you're very thankful for that me but also the fact that all meat you know i wish that our meat system um had some changes to it but you become grateful for all the other meat that we have because you're like wow like look at the buy-in that goes into this you see that it is a life you know and so i think it made me realize you kind of have this like very intense realization that for one life to go on another has to die to your point about the carbon cycle and then the next step is wait a minute i'm not left out of that am i right yep and so this eventually gets me thinking about about death in general and how you know i'm going to die you're going to die we're all going to die and if you think about that if you think about right now we're just sitting here having a moment very soon in the near future you're gonna be having a moment and then all of a sudden there won't be a moment anymore that is an uncomfortable thought right so i start thinking about that and this idea of you know death is the most uncomfortable thing that we can that we can think about really when you do it right you ball up like a child but when i started practicing that i found that it improved my life because it improved my behavior changed my behavior when you realize you're gonna die all of a sudden you don't pop off in traffic someone cut you off you start to make decisions about work and what you're gonna do with your time that are better it improves your interactions with other people everyone from my wife to the lady at the 7-eleven and the thing is that in the u.s we don't think about death we sort of want to ignore it if you look at our structures so we've talked about our food system right our food system is based around meat that you don't really know that it's come from an animal the way that it's processed we even have euphemisms for different cuts of meat instead of saying you know the muscles the muscles that they are and it's also in our funeral system whereas after someone passes away what do we do we dress them up to look as alive and youthful as possible we have a viewing and then we're told to take our mind off it it sounds like take your mind off it don't worry about it don't think about it and i just wondered what some of the repercussions of that are and it got me also thinking about well are there other ways that places do this and so this leads me to this trip to bhutan that i take so bhutan is a very fascinating place and i mean you know you have a whole chapter on it which is amazing and i want to hear all about it were there other candidate places you looked at besides bhutan bhutan came on the radar and it kind of became that i think that's the place i should go no it's a it's an amazing discussion about the contrast yeah so how do they die well i mean first of all what's so fascinating about them is they're on if you measure it by gdp they're 160 something 100 184 or something yeah they just don't dirt poor yeah but in a lot of happiness measurements they rank in the top 20. so they punch way above their weight and death this idea of death and how they approach it i think factors in there's a lot of things going on but i think their relationship with death does factor into this and in bhutan it's they just take it into their life so the bhutanese are told to think about death three times a day it's kind of a cultural practice uh death is woven into a lot of the art and the cultural dances and heritage and there's even these little clay pyramids called sassas so this is mud mixed with ashes of cremated people and they're all over the country all over the country you take a turn like on a bend in a road and there might be 300 of them they're in the window seals in the city i mean they're everywhere so there's this constant reminder and it flows in with this idea of impermanence and buddhism and i think that bhutan is a country really um plays that up so i traveled there to learn more about this and i and this was after the hunt this was after that because it grew out of this understanding of yeah and uh i met with three different people there the first was a guy whose name is uh dasho karma aura and adasho is like secretary in the us like we have secretary of state he's like secretary of happiness right secretary of happiness yes so i meet with him and he just does these happiness measures all around the country and um you know he finds that i think 92 percent of bhutanese say that they are happy or less they have different variations they say i think they have narrowly happy sort of like kind of baseline happy yeah very happy or like i'm extremely happy 92 say they're at least some form of happy and what by contrast do we know what that is in the u.s uh i don't know although i know that some of our numbers there are dropping for sure we're i mean we're definitely not 92 percent yeah i want 40 comes into my mind but definitely don't quote me on that um so he does all these really fascinating it's hard for people to kind of wrap their head around some of this stuff michael i i i'm quite familiar with this research i've um i've talked a lot about with with arthur brooks who also studies this and it's just it's so perplexing until you actually go and experience places away from what we do like i don't think one can cognitively appreciate what you're saying if you're only exposure is what we are doing here you sort of have to you don't necessarily have to go to bhutan but you have to see other parts of the world you know i i several years ago interviewed this amazing physician named tom catina who's like a missionary physician in sudan and he's in you know one of the worst parts of sudan uh at least it was it's it's getting a little bit better now but it's in the nuba mountains there's about a million people there with no access to health care who were being bombed by their government so he's kind of running the hospital that takes care of these people who are getting shrapnel and plus all the normal things that come up you know infections and things like that and you know one of the things we talked about in our discussion was like the fact that nobody's depressed and there's only been one case of suicide that he's ever seen and it was probably related to a brain tumor that completely altered the person's brain and i'm thinking to myself tom the circumstances that you're describing sound so miserable how are people not just in a state of pure misery um and it turns out there's an amazing sense of community which we're going to talk about in bhutan right like there's there is no place you go to die that isn't around here the oldest person the youngest person everybody's together yeah um and they're not they don't seem to be any less happy which again it's mind-boggling that that can be the case yeah and can you i think that there's generally more economic equality too i think that can affect it i think there's a the place definitely feels slower like much slower than the pace of life here um they have more exposure to nature more time in nature also they have no debt i think that you mentioned everyone there how do they own their own homes obviously they're modest homes but how i just think it's inexpensive enough it's so inexpensive yeah and there there's uh it's all uh universal health care and the guy that i spoke to this dasha he goes look our health care isn't perfect but if you have a you have something that needs to be treated that is beyond what we're capable of treating the country will pay for you to the fly to india somewhere else and just that's fully taken care of and fly you back so people generally don't have debt and yeah there is a big sense of community so the what's of course they're so much healthier too is the other thing you said their obesity rate is six percent six percent yeah so that is one of the things that factors into it as well they're generally healthier there's the entire country does not have a stoplight like what right uh there's no mcdonald's or starbucks or burger king i'm not saying those things are bad but i think what they've tried to do is really change the influence of or prevent the influence of other places from coming in and sort of let bhutan kind of figure itself out without other places um intervening i don't know if intervening is the right way influencing that and so that seems to factor into it as well i think most people so i think the city of i think the whole country is maybe three million people wow 600 000 live in tempu which is the capital and then most other people live sort of in the countryside and mountainsides in small communities of maybe 200 people the stress thing is an interesting one as i mentioned we just kind of got back from italy and the thing that i spent the most time thinking about while we're there is why is their life expectancy four or five years greater than ours despite the fact that they smoke non-stop yeah because this is the part i couldn't wrap my head around and again it's like i've been to europe many times i've been to italy once before so it's not like this was the first time i was seeing it it was just the first time i really really thought about it i was like like smoking is the national pastime here it's and by the way it didn't bug me which is weird like in the united states when i smell cigarette smoke it's like i have an allergic reaction i hate it so much somehow being in italy smelling their smoke i was like look it still smells disgusting to me but it just felt so culturally appropriate that i was like huh you know it is what it is i'm not gonna be that american who's gonna open my mouth and and complain about smoke in their country right but i'm like the life expectancy it's like four or five times four or five years greater than ours despite the fact that they're participating in the single most damaging thing you can do to your health well of course what i came to realize after contemplating this for two weeks was everything else they're doing is so much better right like i they're eating a fraction of what we eat and i mean by the way they're still eating pasta gelato it's just the serving sizes are like this tiny yeah um they're much more active but the thing that really blows my mind is and it's not surprising is the pace the pace is just so much lower it's just i really would believe and i don't know what metrics we have to measure this but i can't imagine they are under the stress that we put ourselves under now the flip side of that is because i've also looked thought a lot about this and talked a lot about this people maybe there's a reason the u.s is the world's biggest economy and maybe there's a reason that most of the innovations are coming out of here and not italy for that matter or pick you know bhutan for that reason so i don't want to sound so naive to suggest that you know we should all be like that but you start to appreciate the trade-off yes like we are paying a price to be the world's leaders in innovation we are paying a price to have unlimited access to food and comfort that that you know when we were in tuscany in the middle of nowhere like you there was no you know the home we were staying in in tuscany had no heat and no air conditioning so in the winter it is freezing and in the summer it is basically just a sauna it's a sauna with with clay walls right it's interesting i mean when i started to look at a lot of what kills us now it's all things linked to pace and comfort yeah it's over nutrition under movement too much stress too much stress yeah and you know one thing that i learned as i did this when it when it comes with stress it's the question becomes what is causing our stress a lot of it is manufactured right no one causes your stress you cause your stress amen there's this concept in the book i talk about called prevalence-induced concept change and that's kind of a nerdy way of saying basically problem creep so these scientists at harvard they did this kind of fun study and they noticed this by the way they're waiting in line for tsa they're going to a conference and they're looking at tsa they're going you know a lot of people who are clearly not that threatening get patted down you know it's like grandma's getting the full body pat down because she had a half-filled bottle of hairspray in her purse and you know they just pulled out my banana thinking that it was a beretta or something so they start to wonder you know if all of a sudden everyone just followed the rules would they let everyone flow through and you know just yep go on to your flight or would they start looking for successively smaller things and they thought it would probably be the latter and i bet the reverse is true if if every fourth person coming through actually had a gun with the other three of us who have never carried a gun or threatening thing to an airport never get patted down again right so they do this study and there's two different studies they did where they had people look at 800 different faces and the people had to deem whether the face was threatening or non-threatening to them so that people are going non-threatening non-threatening threatening threatening non-threatening non-threatening what they did is about midway through they started showing the people successfully fewer threatening faces the other one they did was very similar except they were having them read these research proposals so you'd have to say whether the research proposal was ethical or unethical and again somewhere in the middle they started feeding them fewer unethical ones so you would think that people would just start saying threatening fewer times they would start finding fewer things unethical because it's like a person either threatens you or they don't right and something either crosses this moral line you have in the sand or it doesn't right which you've already established through the first half of the study well it didn't what ended up happening is they said that they said threatening the same amount of times same ratio of times they found the same amount of uh studies what word am i looking for now ethical unethical yes and so what their takeaway was is that as we experience fewer and fewer problems we don't actually perceive this we simply go out and look for other problems we don't become more satisfied but the thing is is that as the world improves over time and i think we can agree that even though things aren't perfect right now everyone knows it there's never been a better time to be a human being with respect to the benefits we have yes you're less like again compared to 100 years ago you're more likely to be literate educated you're less likely to die at any moment on and on and on but when you poll people only something like 12 of people think the world is improving it's because we're always moving the goal post and i think this makes evolutionary sense because in the past when the world was hard when you did have serious life-threatening problems if you were always identifying the next problem okay that's going to give you a survival advantage if you're always okay we gotta fix this thing this thing okay this is a problem fix that fix that but in today's age as things become successfully better we look for problems where they maybe don't exist or our problems become more hollow oh yeah i agree with completely i think there's another issue at play here and i've thought about this so much you know the first time i started thinking about this problem was ten years ago when i read guns germs and steel jared diamond's book which i'm sure you've read and if people haven't read it it's uh it's a great read i suspect some of it is now dated and there's you know i don't know if he's written an updated version of it but what what it got me thinking about a lot was how awful life was i mean there's just no other way to put it like it's it's we can sit here and talk about romanticizing some elements of a world with no iphone the reality of it is like i wouldn't want to be one of the hadza right now even if you look at the hadza today which are one of the last tribes of hunter-gatherers so that's kind of our one of our final windows into what people were doing 10 000 years ago there's like literally not a second of that that i think of as desirable outside of a vacation and by vacation i mean like a hard experience you would go through for a couple of weeks to make you more appreciative of what you have when you're back in plush austin texas yes um but i can honestly say like i would never want to exist back in that world it was awful it was so awful that i can't believe we survived it yes i just can't believe i am tied to the genetics of people who managed to survive that it's unbelievable and especially after we start to establish cities because then all of a sudden you have one king and you're out in the field for 12 hours a day in service of that in service of that king and you're starving the whole time and you have you know you have all these problems with malnutrition you're living in with like no sanitary it's just totally terrible did you ever see that movie the duel uh with uh um matt damon and adam driver no so it's it's sort of uh it's loosely a true story based on the last time there was a duel the last time the king of france authorized a duel and i i believe it's sort of i don't know i want to say 16th century maybe 15th century so call it like 500 years ago directionally really good movie i really i really quite liked it but again i'm like looking at the movie through a different lens which i'm always doing when i'm watching movies and the lens i'm looking at it through is this is a movie about the most privileged people in france like the kings the knights the the most privileged and at the time france and england were the most privileged in the world so you're looking at the most privileged people in a society that is the most privileged society on the planet and this is only 500 years ago which might sound like a long time but when we start talking about what 11 59 33 means people will understand how not long that is and i'm thinking i would rather be homeless today than the king of france 500 years ago like it is unbelievable abject misery they lived in it's yeah it's it's very crazy and to your point what you said earlier a lot of it gets romanticized and it's oh yeah you should you should check it out go back there see if you can it's terrible so it's a mate life is amazing too i mean yeah bottom line so so yeah i mean that to me is the is the is the thing that you you're constantly weighing which is we have this incredible privilege today to be alive and all we need to do because to me this is how i read the book right i don't read the book as saying we need to go back and be hunter-gatherers no it's sort of like saying look you have this incredible it's like a it's like an uncle ben moment with spider-man right it's like with great power comes great responsibility we have this great power today we have processed food which by the way and the guy that you talk about in your book i think does a great job of explaining to you out of the gate hey don't think processed means bad processed is actually what allows us to like not get poisoned every time we eat food yeah um so you have all of these things that allow you so much latitude do more with it right that's that's to me what really what it comes down to is we have the ability to help more people right you know if you if you think about what it was like 500 years ago if a person had mental illness 500 years ago like i don't know how many other people were bending over backwards to try to make their lives better because you were just too busy trying to survive yeah um whereas today like you can help somebody else um yes that's the that's the responsibility that comes with the privilege of having so much you can afford to try to feed other people that aren't being fed yeah and again in a world of over nutrition it seems almost absurd that anybody would go without yeah yeah i think the argument that i'm making is that in a way we've come become victims of our own success and if we don't have times that push back against what we have and sort of reframe how lucky we are in the grand scheme of time and space and give us insight into these things are all wonderful but if i use them all the time seems like bad things tend to happen yep processed food great keeps us all alive that's why there's nearly eight billion people on the planet same time if that is who don't have to move around like yeah think about this like we get to sit in the same place yeah yeah but if you're always eating the most comforting food all the time you're going to have some problems it's great that you don't don't have to quote unquote exercise or physically work for your food every day it's great but at the same time if you never reinsert exercise into your life to make up for that you're going to have some problems it's great that i can if i feel bored i can go on instagram and watch the most entertaining 15 seconds of my life and probably laugh my ass off for a week because i've found something so funny right which is hard to imagine like that couldn't have been done a hundred years ago yeah and here we are and then but if you're always doing that yeah then it's like that comes with uh problems so the argument that i'm making in the book is that we need sort of moments that push back at us and reframe things if the entire history of this universe were laid out in a calendar year can you give some milestones i love where did you read about this or learn about this i was uh i was driving to work in my truck 29 and it was on a podcast someone walked through it and i just started bawling like you know i'm driving past like a chipotle just this you know kind of fitness bro like oh my god that's so much time you know um why okay well so tell give give the answer and then i want to talk about why that what that meant to you emotionally yeah so the answer is that the big bang happens the big bang happens on january 1st uh i believe that our galaxy forms i might get the months like september september earth forms in november dinosaurs uh die off on december 25th after appearing on december 20th or something yeah yeah they were around for you know five days on this calendar or yeah that's right the 25th to the 29th or something right of december of december all of human history that we have written down happens new year's eve 11 59 starting at 30 30 33 seconds 33 seconds in that is all of recorded human history that is how little time we've been here it's crazy it is unbelievable all of recorded human history is 27 seconds the last 27 seconds of a year yes so for me that was one of the things too that you know i started thinking about just that you're it makes you realize you're not that damn important in the grand scheme of time and space now that sounds like it's kind of you're being hard on yourself but at the same time i would go one step further it's that you are completely unimportant i mean it's like you couldn't be less relevant yeah and so that you know that can be unnerving at first but at the same time i need to do the calculation of what an average human lifespan is because it's milliseconds on that scale yeah yeah yeah definitely and once you have that realization i think that it can change your behavior in a positive way yeah we're all here we're all going to die right yeah yeah and and so going back to this and again it's just fresh on my mind because i just kind of got back so we're staying with this friend in in in this place in in tuscany and it's uh you know it's like a 400 acre farm that has been built up over years so the first thing that was built on that farm was 500 years old it was like an old church and and then like you know three you know and then 50 years later this other house got built and then 100 years later this other thing got built and then 100 years so the the newest thing on this farm is 300 years old the oldest thing is probably 5 600 years old that's your that's your yeah and i had this sense that came over me while i was there which was i felt so good being in a place where i knew so many people had lived and died why do you think that was um for the exact reason that you just said which is it really made me feel appropriately irrelevant and i said to my friend um so my friend's an american but he lives there like three months out of the year i said dude i'm not being facetious so you can say no but if i know if i if if my death is reasonably inevitable like i have cancer or something like that um would you be cool if i came and died here and and was buried here and he's like yeah man that would be fantastic cool um because i feel like i would really like to kind of die in a place where i'm just in you know i'm just an irrelevant piece of the long beautiful history of our species and then i've never liked the idea of these you know funerals and things like that but i'd like i'd like could i just be buried there right by the olive trees so that my carbon and my nitrogen become a part of an olive tree that someone will drink olive oil from you know 25 years later um and i don't have to describe it like i just i i'm sure there are some places in the u.s where you might find that feeling but again certainly nothing here that's 300 years old let alone 500 years old let alone a couple thousand years old and i think that as morbid as it is to think like that i don't know i feel like i'm excited about the possibility of hey will i be fortunate enough to have enough of a warning when i'm gonna die that i could go and die there yeah it's so when i was getting sober a phrase i learned is rule 62 don't don't take yourself so damn seriously and that reinforces that for me right it's like i think people have a tendency to take themselves and the things in their life so seriously and once you realize it's things aren't that big of a deal like you got one ride you don't have to always ride the gas all the time you know like you can slow down sometimes that's been relatively freeing for me and also i think improved i mean if we want to talk about improving performance at work and in life like that's kind of a life hack because once you kind of let off yourself it's like you're free to kind of do the things i think you want to do and let your mind go where it needs to go especially for me doing creative work you know if i don't put all this pressure on myself i'm like look no one's going to read this book in 200 years 100 years 20 years like who knows right just make it good like it's a it's a ride you know i remember watching this uh documentary about the grateful dead one of my favorite bands they are my favorite band oh really and uh i think it was maybe it was 67 when they're kind of coming up and they take a bunch of acid as the grateful dead do living in san francisco and uh how big was the band at that point in time so they started by they they rose by playing the original acid tests that uh ken keezy would do that eventually got written about in the electric kool-aid acid test and so this would have been done three years after that they're kind of starting to come up they're in la and there's this big la tower thing that this guy had like built over years and years and years and garcia talks about you know people taurus would come to see this big tower this guy had built he looks at it and he's like you know i want to just create things that live and explode in the moment and just have fun like in this moment and that ultimately guided them as a band forever and that's you can see that in their music that every song is like its own exploding moment and that's kind of what we are as humans right no one's going to remember you you're not going to have this big monument to you it's like man ride this thing out like give yourself some space and just like enjoy it you know so what's misogyny misogy so i learned about this concept from a guy whose name is marcus elliott he he went to harvard med school but decided he didn't want to be a traditional doctor he decided that he wanted to get into sports science he wants to revolutionize sportszone and he kind of ends up doing it in a way he's the first guy to really bring ai and movement tracking into uh pro sports and by using this data he can basically tell people you know the way that your knee caves in as you do this you might have a 60 chance of injury based on all the other cases we've seen of men of your size in the nba whatever so it's kind of all about these numbers and data and figures that can improve performance but he also believes that what improves performance and potential it can't always be measured in a way there's intangibles that some people have and so to get to these he does this idea called misogyny now the setup the backup for this is is why it's important is that if you think about how humans evolved we used to have to do hard things all the time no safety net this could be from a big hunt moving from summering to wintering grounds tiger lurking in the bushes all these different things so we were challenged all the time and if we failed we would die but each time we would take on one of these challenges you would inevitably learn what your potential was right you would really have to dig deep push and you would come out of that assuming it went well made it out the other side knowing what you were capable of but now in modern life you start to see a shift where you can live a decent life and you're never really challenged especially physically in a way that it you know sort of almost blends mind body spirit you know you you'll have your running water you'll have your food you'll have your home you'll have your family and it's really great but you know he argues and i i'm with him on this that if you think of human potentials like a really big circle it's like most people are kind of in this little dinner plate size thing right here because we never explore those edges really what we're capable of so enter misogyny and this is this idea that once a year i'm gonna go out into nature i'm gonna do something really hard some challenging tasks so there are only two rules of mosogi rule number one is that it has to be really hard so he defines this by saying you have a 50 50 shot at finishing whatever it is this misogyny tassie decided to take on it has to be true 50 50 because now i think when people take on challenges especially when there's a physical element they pick things that they know they will finish that are within their capabilities so if you look at how marathoners approach running a marathon it's not i don't know if i'm going to be able to finish this marathon right i don't know if i'm gonna be able to finish this marathon in under three hours or whatever yeah yeah uh the second rule of mossogi which i like as much as the first rule so you can't die don't die now that is kind of a tongue-in-cheek way of basically saying be safe on this thing so to give examples isn't there also a third sort of rule of misogy there's guidelines so oh i thought there was a we don't talk about misogyny like you don't go and like doesn't get up on instagram yes so that is then there's two guidelines the the two guidelines are one you don't talk about mosogi publicly you you can talk about it with friends with your with your wife and close ones but you don't put it on instagram and facebook and twitter and the reason for that is so many times now this rule this guideline was a guideline before social media but so much stuff that people do today is often for the grand right you want to do something so you can post it and by removing this all of a sudden you have this question of if you're doing something really hard and you want to quit are you going to keep going for you knowing that it's not going to be for a pat on the back some sort of social with social implications the second guideline is that the misogyny should be somewhat quirky make something up the reason for that is because once you re remove sort of artificial metrics that changes the game right if you're doing a marathon all of a sudden you're thinking about your time you're thinking about all these different things that are kind of socially constructed whereas if you just pick some random task it's like well let's just see if we can do it we have no we have no framework for this and that kind of opens up the door for some interesting experiences so some of the misogies that this guy has done is one year him and a few guys they got an 85 pound boulder and they walked it underneath the santa barbara channel i think it was five miles so one guy would dive down pick up the boulder walk 10 yards drop it go up the next guy would dive down rinse and repeat until you're at point b but there's also simpler things like here's this mountain that we see every day let's see if we can get up there in a single day things like that now the point of these there's two big reasons for doing something like this one is that it teaches you that you chronically undersell your potential so if you choose an appropriately hard task you're going to have a moment where you go i'm done i gotta quit i've reached my edge there's there's no going back from this but if you can keep putting one foot in front of the other then you get this other moment that's much more important and that's where you look back and go well wait a minute i thought my edge was back there but i am clearly past it now and that suggests that i'm selling myself short and the more important question that comes from that is okay where else in my life am i selling myself short so you see that you're capable of more the second thing that comes from this is that it can reframe fear for people because we're wired to avoid failure at all costs because failure in the past used to mean death so of course we would want to not fail but today failure isn't death it's i don't know mistyping in an email you misspeak when you're speaking to a group of people something like that yet we still fear those kind of things like their death so sort of dancing on the edge of failure you can realize that it's not that big of a deal now when i first learned about this it sounded cool it sounded intriguing the same time i'm like okay it's kind of quirky just like some made up thing and then i started really researching what was happening here and we used to call things like this right to passage so when we had a young person who was at point a in their life and we needed to get them to point b where they were more confident competent a better contributor to the tribe what would we do we would send them out into nature to do something really hard yeah right and along the way they would struggle they would battle they would have moments of doubt but they would ultimately come out on the other side realizing that they were capable of a lot more and they could bring that back into society and improve the tribe as a whole and you saw these what's interesting is you see these across cultures this is this wasn't that one tribe said hey we're doing this thing it's pretty cool you should try it too and that tribe put the word out not these just plain this arose independently throughout you know through culture they just it just arises and it's also in mythology so if you look at the work of joseph campbell on the hero's journey it's the hero exits the comfort of home he or she goes into a trying middle ground they're faced with battles they have to go inward and they have to physically strive and then they come back into society with the treasure or the talisman or whatever it is well what is the treasure of the talisman it's not the actual physical object it's the way that person has changed and that change that they can bring back into society and you're you've seen it falling away of traditional rites of passage like this which is why when you were talking about sending your daughter to that camp i got so excited because i think kids really would benefit adults too but kids in particular really benefit from having times where they get pushed to their edges and they have those moments where of doubt that they're not sure what they're capable of but then they cross it and realize oh i've got more on board than i really ever imagined because i you look at what people can accomplish when the conditions are like a survive condition it's incredible what people can do and it also makes evolutionary sense to undersell yourself yeah keeps you safe keeps you safe yeah you don't want to be the hold my beer guy right that person dies so it's a practice that i do in my own life and as i said it's when i first kind of heard about it i go yeah sounds kind of fun also kind of like quirky and then when you start to learn more it goes oh wow this is actually a powerful thing and when you look at research on challenges in people's lives the people who have the worst rates of mental health are the people who have had a ton of challenges like an overwhelming amount of challenges and traumas but on the opposite end of the spectrum are people who have no challenge in their life and no traumas they have equally poor rates of mental health so it's kind of a u-shaped curve where having enough challenge in your life that you learn that you're what you're capable of that you can persist through things that you've got this seems to be healthy for people so speaking of challenges right one of my favorite challenges now that we get to talk about even though it would never rise to the level of a misogyny but as a daily practice is rucking so why is it that people like you and i have taken to this thing and maybe we could start by just kind of defining what is rocking rocking is carrying weight for the sake of weight in a backpack so it the word grew out of military circles so in the military uh wrecking is just a standard fitness practice it is the main fitness tool that the us military and militaries all around the world going back hundreds and hundreds of years you use to build fitness for soldiers it is just carrying weight on your back in a backpack and it's interesting because this is again kind of a feature that is unique to our species yes i started thinking about this when i was hunting because once you kill the animal and you have the meat you have to pack it out so if you look at why the human body is built the way it is and what we're physically good at we're good at two things the first is running long distances in the heat so if you've read born to run or that was spawned from a two thousand four paper and then lieberman yep by dan lieberman and we have all these adaptations that make us good at running long distances slowly in the heat and we would use that to hunt on hot dogs and it's not even running i mean like over 24 hours we could walk further in a day than an animal could go at whatever pace it chose yes yeah absolutely we don't have to be running we can just simply be walking three miles in an hour yeah we'll walk 75 miles in a day we're unbelievable at covering ground and animals on a hot day four-legged animals they're not efficient at cooling themselves we are that's one of our adaptations so we sweat our noses are really complex nasal cavities of cool air all these different things and so we would chase animals down until they essentially toppled over from heat exhaustion and we would spear them and then this leads to the second thing that we're good at which is we would then have to carry that animal back to camp and we also have adaptations that make us really good at caring and we are in fact the only animal that can carry yeah i was really surprised to learn how lousy primates are at carrying they're terrible very terrible so we will still be more i think we can hold up to 33 of our body weight and still be more efficient at covering ground than most other primates with no weight with no weight yeah just on their own they have this sort of tipsy weird gait um there's a technical term for it i forget it but it's not efficient at all and arguably yeah which i completely like i weigh 180 i could easily carry a 60 pound kettlebell in one hand it's easier if i could make it a 30 and a 30 but even a 60 in one hand it's like nothing yeah most people can yeah yeah and to think that that's more efficient than a primate is with nothing with nothing yeah yeah and uh it definitely shaped us and the experience of carrying out meat is really what made had me starting to think that because i had been familiar with the lieberman work and all that and it was in my mind and thinking about how you know it's linked this this running's linked to hunting and but then you carry and you're like oh they would have had to do this too like we also seem to be the only species that can really do this well and you know arguably we carried a lot more as early humans than we would have run because running is mostly reserved for hunts whereas you look at what is gathering so you go pick up some stuff and carry it around as you get more stuff and then you carry it back to camp and um so i actually went to harvard to meet with uh lieberman and um that was a really fun meeting he's a fascinating guy i enjoyed talking to him but so i argue in the book that when you look at running is obviously popular jogging is a thing right or is it jogging i can't remember if the j is jogging it's jogging yeah yeah but carrying is not as a form of fitness and activity and i ultimately ended up traveling to goruck hq and this is a the tribe i argue that has really adopted caring is the military through rocking that's like the only group is really putting this at scale and goruck is a company that makes backpacks that are specific for rocking and their founder whose name is jason mccarthy he is uh he's sort of leaned into wrecking as a as a form of fitness as i started to really look at the research on it it's really great for us because you're working your cardiovascular system but you're also working your strength system to a degree so you're not going to get that with you know running or cycling something that is a pure endurance act whereas with wrecking you're getting the endurance but also you've got load on your body and so that is stimulating your muscles to a greater degree and there's some really fascinating studies on backcountry hunters who will carry in loads you know and to deep into the mountains and they'll test their body fat before and after and those hunters across i think it was a 10-day study a small study there's there's only so many weirdos like that they lost 14 of their body fat and they actually stayed with same amount of muscle some actually gained like an ounce or two of muscle so it's really good at melting fat and preserving muscle and um the the other thing i think that's for me something i really enjoy about it is you know most of my cardio is done on a bike um but as you said there's no load on a bike and i used to run a lot growing up that was sort of my thing and i'm really i feel pretty fortunate that despite 60 mile weeks growing up i still have perfectly fine knees and hips but i also realize as much as i would love to go back to running i don't want to poke the bear i just i dodged a bullet in life being able to run so much without hurting myself but as i'm older i don't i just don't think that's the case and i think when you look at i think it's about eight times your body weight is the force experienced by your knees with every step when you run obviously weight matters and the lighter you are the better and it's not a surprise that the best runners are you know feather light for obvious reasons but with walking it's only about three times your weight so when you're rocking you're walking not running and yes you're adding more weight so let's say you increase your body weight by a factor of 30 percent the 30 percent increase at a 3x multiple of force is much less than your body weight at eight times the force if you're running in other words as hard as rucking is with all that extra weight it's still much easier on your knees than running yes and you're still getting i mean yesterday was the first ad rocked in two weeks cause we just got back from vacation and i've been walking non-stop while we were there but it wasn't the same holy cow like much harder even just taking two weeks off it's really like a type of workout my heart rate hit like 165. i was in the 150s and 160s which is totally uncommon for me when rocking i'm normally in the 130s 140s but i guess because i was sort of deconditioned for not because all my walking in europe was you know without load yeah so it really made a difference it really showed me just how demanding it is it is and the the injury data is really interesting to your point when you look at studies on people in the military what tends to injure soldiers is running that has i mean when they'll even throw people into they'll do studies where they look at injury rates across something like a selection which is you know a long process where these guys are being just hammered and they're all getting injured by running that's not to say that some people don't get injured by rocking but it's like very very small numbers comparatively and so for that reason i think it's a lot safer but it sort of also gives you to your point your ability to get a higher heart rate than you would from walking and also preserve muscle yeah the the thing that i've got my daughter really embracing is the the hills because on the uphill you're just obliterating your heart and lungs but also and my daughter might be the only 13 year old to really be able to explain to you the difference between eccentric and concentric strength because all the times we're walking down hills i'm explaining to her how this is working her eccentric strength and her quads and this is where you get your breaks from but i mean i love the walking downhill as well and you know really trying to be as deliberate about it as possible and really making sure because in life that's where people fail right so when you get older you know never mind running it's like can you walk downstairs without collapsing can you take us can you walk off a step and not hurt yourself well if the answer is i don't know how to decelerate the answer is no you're hosed right and there's no better way to learn to decelerate than with a big load on your back walking downhill yes that will teach you how to decelerate and that's not something you get easily in the gym no it's it's not something you get easily running it's it's you just don't get that skill any other way that i'm aware of and if you do fall you're going to be better off if you've been rocking because it also is rather good at improving bone density really interesting studies on women where it improves bone density better than weight lifting alone better than you know cardio alone and that becomes so important as women age you look at in sort of hunter-gatherer societies that are always carrying things i mean they stay strong and vital their entire lives and they just don't get hit fractures yeah i i you stated in the book and we've sort of loosely described it here but i just think you know if if the if you if if if mcdougall argues we're born to run i i would argue we're born to carry that is my argument we are born to carry if you look at what people what people in hunter-gatherer societies actually spend their time doing physically no one runs like you even look at the tarahumara they they very rarely run and it's not for fun it's for ceremonial purposes you know but work life is caring yeah and and you know a reasonably well trained person we can get most of our patients to the point where they can carry their body weight now again you're not going to start out there if you're not well trained but like a reasonably fit person could for a minute carry their body weight in their hands yeah yes you could carry it longer on your back but but even the fact that we have the grip strength the limb strength to carry our body weight uh is is just fantastic i mean one of the metrics we use with with female patients who obviously have less upper body strength is 75 of your body weight carried for a minute is one of like our multiple you know we have many sort of strength metrics we put people through that's a great one that's that's you know think about that for a moment that's like that's pretty impressive especially in light of what you said earlier so so what are kind of some of the so so by the way you know uh i i didn't even know what rucking was when i was kind of doing it in training for hunts but i realized you know what i do now is so much better because then i was just using a weight vest right so you'll see later our backyard is really really steep and so i would you know in the weeks leading up to hunts i would put on a 50-pound weight vest and just go up and down up and down up and down up and down the hill um but why is it that a rucksack we would agree and argue is is better than a weight vest what is it what is it offering over a weight vest it tends to pull your spine into a better position so most people today since we work in front of desks we're slumped over all the time we're naturally slumped when you put weight on your back it sort of puts your spine in a safer position and that can actually seems to relieve and prevent back pain now that is according to i spoke with stu miguel who's the back expert up in canada and he's a huge fan of rucking he's a very careful person when it comes to exercise um in my experience with him i mean he's very nuanced and he's a person i trust because of that and he said you know wrecking is a great way to add some durability to people in a way that's safe the other thing i think about wrecking and i also own you know several rucksacks from goruck now as well the belt really makes a difference when you get that belt on your hips because you know i had shoulder surgery four months ago and one of the things i was super stressed about was not being able to ruck because you know i'm gonna have my shoulder operated on and amazingly i was probably wrecking three weeks after surgery and i couldn't do much else let's be clear um but how was i able to do that well first of all you know you've got really well placed straps on your shoulders that are not you know it's not putting my joint at risk and and more importantly the majority of the weight because you control where the load is by how you adjust it but i basically just said i'm gonna put all the load on my hips and i'll i'll cook my legs a bit more but i will spare my shoulder yeah so that's kind of to me the other thing about the the rucksack that really really beats the weight vest is that you're you have the distribution to load posteriorly but you also can really distribute the load on your hips which anyone who's hunted or done any backcountry stuff knows like are really it's so important to have your pack fit well on your hips otherwise you could simply couldn't carry 100 pounds on your shoulders for very long yeah when i was in the arctic and we were packing out caribou we were heavy i mean over 100 pounds you know maybe one time who knows 20. um it was nice to have the hip belt because i would sort of spend most of my time with the weight on the hips but eventually that just starts to burn and you need to wash that out so you pop it your shoulders for a while and you can just kind of go i love that i love that back and forth on off on off yeah yeah just trying to find something that isn't absolutely awful for a moment uh it's good burn though it's funny when my wife started wrecking with me and my wife is like i think she's a super tough chick um she has i think she has a very high pain tolerance the first time she ever did a dead hang she went three minutes and eight seconds oh wow she's like insane yeah um and she's gone longer since but the first couple times she did it she was like ugh does this ever stop hurting and i was like no i wouldn't say it ever really stops hurting i mean you can lighten the load but you know i was like no it's it's it's uncomfortable like i'm not gonna lie to you this is not something that ever if you're doing it the way we're doing it which is you know we're about a third of our body weight and we're walking as quickly as we can yeah while walking no this is just uncomfortable there's no two ways about it it will be uncomfortable and but the upside is is that you know i'll even take rucking meetings where i'll toss in 20 pounds or something and i'll just walk around while on this i know i'm gonna have to be on this phone call i could sit in my desk an office in the dark or i could go outside and have a light load and get it all taken care of there and sneak in a bunch of steps with some weight on my back and it's very easy to flow into life and it's like if you were if you know you're already going to be walking the dogs we'll just toss on a pack and all of a sudden that becomes a lot more effective i've got so many friends uh uh and i don't get any kickbacks i don't i don't know anybody at goruck so i but i've sent so many people there um i think we will at some point hopefully do a subscriber discount with with them because i you know i just would love to get more and more people doing this yeah they i've tried a handful of packs for rocking specifically and they definitely are my favorite that's why they're in the book and they've thought about it deeply yeah they've got some great content as well some great videos and stuff we'll link to so i mean look i think this has been such an interesting journey i um as i've said to you many times before i think this is just on some level it's such an obvious thing right like it's one of those books where you read it and you're like yeah of course but if if you're not if it's not pointed out to you it's really easy to miss how this has happened comfort has become so ubiquitous that i don't think we're aware of it anymore it's kind of like the david foster wallace this is water thing that the ubiquity of the water of course creates the irony of the fish not knowing what water is and i kind of feel like that's what comfort has become for at least those of us in the developed world yeah i think so and i i also think that sometimes even if you're pressing against it in one way there's probably a lot of other ways that you're not pressing it against it i have friends that can you know run 25 miles now if you if i ask them to but if i said hey why don't you sit in silence for 10 minutes it's like what they couldn't handle that so there's all these things that we've removed from our lives over time that i think have a benefit and it is figuring out well what are those things which is what i'm trying to present in the book and then how do i intelligently weave them in my life because as we talked about earlier i'm not trying to suggest in any way that we go back to living as hunter-gatherers like no way life today is amazing but it's how can we use some of those things from the past to build a better future yeah i agree and it's part of its hunger you know i used to do a lot of fasting i don't fast as much anymore but one of the things i loved about fasting was how much i learned what i could do when i was hungry you know i would do sort of seven up to ten day water only fasts wow but i'd keep working out hard throughout and the first couple of times it almost killed me i mean the first i remember the first time i tried to put myself through serious workouts during a seven-day fast i mean i thought i was gonna die wow um and it's not to suggest that during those fasts i was as strong or you know uh my performance was what it was normally it wasn't it never was but you know i just kept i just couldn't imagine and other things like i remember going to bed so hungry sometimes thinking i'll never be able to sleep but yet i did and you realize like of course you did this there's no way our species would be here if we couldn't figure out how to do these things when we're hungry uh you know be it sleep or go out and hunt or do something like that so yeah when you think of all of these forms of discomfort it can be hunger it can be boredom it can be a physical challenge um time in nature yep it's to me that's that's the take home is we have we have this incredible privilege and it just comes with a little responsibility which is just make sure on a daily basis you are inserting brief windows of discomfort so that you're never too far from realizing that you're in the water speed you said it in other words if you're the fish just make sure you jump out of the water a few times a day so that you never lose sight of the water you're in hey man yes sir well you know what we get to do now are we going to go rock we sure are yes michael thanks very much for coming i i've enjoyed talking about this a lot and i i hope everybody picks up the book because it's fantastic yeah thanks a lot peter i really enjoyed the conversation and now we get a ruck and suffer a little bit and for dinner elk and axis deer awesome perfect day [Music]
