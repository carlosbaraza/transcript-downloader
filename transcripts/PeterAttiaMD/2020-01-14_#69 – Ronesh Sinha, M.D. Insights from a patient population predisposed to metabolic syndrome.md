## Description

Full title: #69 – Ronesh Sinha, M.D.: Insights into the manifestation of metabolic disease in a patient population predisposed to metabolic syndrome, and what it teaches us more broadly

Original release date: 9/2/19

In this episode, Dr. Ronesh Sinha, a physician, author, and educator based in Silicon Valley, shares his many insights into metabolic illness that he has gleaned from his South Asian patient population. In this conversation we focus on hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, blood pressure, obesity, etc. and ways to address them with nutrition, sleep, exercise, stress management, and more. We also take a deep dive into insulin resistant phenotypes, evolutionary theory and geographic determinants of insulin resistance which provides insight into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. Additionally, we discuss the surprisingly interrelated topic of stress, and how we might be inadvertently passing this on to our children, leading to mental and physical sickness down the road. 

We discuss:
-How a stubborn case of insulin resistance connected Peter with Ronesh [7:15];
-Ronesh’s clinical treatment focus of metabolic illnesses in South and East Asian patient populations [8:45];
-The distinction between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat stores [15:00];
-Shortcomings of a body mass index (BMI) calculator for evaluating metabolic disease risk [17:15];
-Cortisol and blood glucose variability [28:30];
-Insulin’s role in elevated blood glucose: A symptom of metabolic syndrome [33:25];
-Mechanistic explanations of insulin resistance (there may be more than one) [35:15];
-Theories on origins and evolutionary reasons for insulin resistance [40:00];
-The inverse relationship between the amount of brown adipose tissue and rates of insulin resistance, and the role of climate in patterns and prevalence of insulin resistance [49:50];
-Vitamin D levels, hyperinsulinemia, and other effects [53:45];
-The evolutionary benefit of being able to turn fructose into fat (and the price we are now paying for it) [58:00];
-The VO2 max relationship to insulin resistance and familial metabolic health [59:30];
-Using zone 2 fitness test to evaluate mitochondrial performance [1:01:15];
-Exercise for long-term functional health [1:06:00];
-Lifestyle changes to improve insulin resistance and other metabolic phenotypes [1:14:00];
-Is PCOS a manifestation of insulin resistance? [1:21:00];
-The impact of stress on adiposity, and Peter’s treatment regimen for overweight females resistant to typical nutritional approaches [1:23:45];
-How a culture of achievement and expectations can lead to undue stress, unhappiness, and health problems in our children (a Silicon Valley case study) [1:35:00];
-The negative impact of devices and social media on children [1:48:45];
-How you can help yourself, your family, and your community without being an MD or PhD [1:55:00]; and
-More.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. Ramesh Sinha Rhenish who really goes by Ron is an internist in the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and he created a South Asian medical consultant service for his medical group in Silicon

[00:04:24] Valley a connective the Ron about five years ago and I think we talked about this at the very beginning of podcast largely because I was running up against some brick walls and taking care of some of my South Asian patients at the time and seeing just kind of a different pattern of metabolic illness and when I was introduced to Ron and got familiar with his books we just basically began a friendship at that time although interestingly this was the first time we met in person to record this podcast so it was sort of an interesting experience feeling you know you know somebody but then you for the first time get to sit down with them and it was great we just had a really interesting discussion about a number of topics obviously we focus a lot on what hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance metabolic dysregulation inflammation all these things look like in his patient population but his patient population is basically a model system that allows you to understand lots of patients so if you're listening to this as someone who takes care of patients with insulin resistance or if you yourself have any of the things that go along with this high blood pressure insulin resistance you're overweight all these things in many ways this is a really great podcast to go into the how to address these things with respect to you know we talked about everything from nutrition to sleep etc I would say one of the things about this podcast it was a totally pleasant surprise was the part of the discussion that we ended at which is Ron's really interesting and unique purview into what's happening in Silicon

[00:05:55] Valley with respect to stress and with respect to how that is trickling down into kids and in fact you know something he said to me at the very and after we would we had stopped recording but we were sitting around talking and this is often the case where you have these amazing discussions ten minutes after you turn the mic off and he said something effective you know I just can't believe at how little happiness exists in the Silicon Valley and he wasn't making a general statement of like you cross the board he was saying look I take care of patients who work for some of the greatest companies in the world by whatever metric we would you know make that claim financially or whatever and he said and yet it's kind of amazing how unhappy and stressed out so many of these people are and you can see it in their law because that's sort of something about

[00:06:41] Ron's practice that's pretty unique is he takes care of whole families across generations and he sort of gets to see things that certainly I don't get to see and that I think many patients are rather many physicians don't so I think this podcast is going to be something worth listening to if you have any interest in metabolic health but also this last part where we talk about with respect to kids and with respect to maybe some of the things that those of us that have kids could do better certainly something that I took a lot away from that discussion and I actually look forward to trying to implement a number of the suggestions that Ron made so I hope you'll enjoy my discussion with dr. Ron Sinha hey Ron thanks for making the trip up to San Francisco today it is great to be here I know we chatted a few years ago but it's finally great to meet you face-to-face I know and I was sort of joking before what is the commute from Los Altos up to San

[00:07:33] Francisco today so today it took me a good little bit less than an hour yeah it's incredible right you could take two and a half hours if you time it wrong right exactly right yeah it's funny because on the weekends when you drive off hours you realize the bear is actually a very small place but with traffic it feels extensive so yeah yeah

[00:07:50] I think we won't get into the who has worst traffic la San Francisco you're right right no this is really cool this the first time we've met in person but I do feel like I kind of know you just through so many emails and discussions over the last five years and you pointed out that Mark Sisson introduced us which

[00:08:04] I had totally forgotten I had lost track of how we actually connected in the first place and I actually have been remiss in needing to catch up with Mark Sisson as well I don't think I've seen mark in probably about three or four years yeah and he's enjoying Southern California right now I think he's see I thought he even oh no no you're right and I'm sorry he actually moved to

[00:08:20] Florida yeah yeah yeah so I think what originally connected us was I had a patient from India who had an unusually stubborn case of insulin resistance and it came with a slightly different phenotype and it wasn't just one patient I think it was probably two patients and there was something about it that looked a little different from the usual hyperinsulinemia that I had seen and it was the impressive degree of inflammation that had come

[00:08:54] I believe that is what initially led me to your book and then to you so before we get into that sort of stuff maybe tell us a little bit about what you do medically how you got to where you've got and eventually I guess why you're interested in this particular problem absolutely so I'd say about 16 years ago when I came out of medical training I came to the Bay Area and in medical training when we talked about diabetes and cardiovascular disease the types of case studies we did were typically older african-americans Caucasians or smoking eating red meat sort of that theater type and I get to basically the bay area and I start seeing patients in my clinic at that point was pretty much proximal to a lot of Silicon Valley companies and

[00:09:33] I started seeing a ton of people of East Asian and particularly South Asian background that were coming in with really early diabetes and with wicked family histories of diabetes and heart disease and almost every family member and this is something I'd never knew about Peter I'd kind of read anecdotally about this but I didn't realize that this was such a common manifestation and then as I started digging more into the research I realized when you look at the

[00:09:55] UK in Canada there is unprecedented amounts of diabetes and early heart disease in these patients so what I realized at that time was there's a huge gap because we didn't have any good resources to really help these patients I mean you can't give an Indian vegetarian a diagram of the Mediterranean food pyramid that's not going to be very useful for them so at that point I sort of made a commitment that I'm gonna create some educational materials nutrition that's kind of focused on this population but incidentally at that time too while I followed my own advice I watched my self development a bollock syndrome and at this point I was lecturing to companies about healthy lifestyles a lot of them are asking me to come out and talk to our Indian patients about why they're developing these conditions and frankly at that time I felt like kind of a fraud because here I'm giving the advice and I see my triglyceride shoot up to above 300 my age Hills in the 20s my ratios are way elevated I'm like what's going on here and at that point I sort of stepped outside of nutritional guidelines and looked at okay really the root cause here is insulin resistance

[00:10:47] I can't just provide a one-stop sort of meal plan for all these patients I've got to do some deeper research where device were you giving at that point in time that you felt you weren't able to follow or even if you were following it it wasn't working I was really falling more of a low-fat low-cholesterol caloric based model because that's all I basically knew I knew a little bit about carbohydrate restriction and those types of approaches but I didn't really see that as being a meaningful way to approach it and really at that time I was following everything to the tee five days a week eating the right types of diet were you vegetarian also no no so I'm from a

[00:11:19] Bengal from North India so we eat red meat we eat fish that's a staple part of our diet so I wasn't but still eating a lot of sort of the healthy starches at that time and recommending meth to patients as well and and you bring up a key point because at least half of my patients were vegetarian Indians and I noticed some of the most significant lipoprotein abnormalities in those patients really unprecedented diabetes so I was like what's going on here these guys are eating the Indian vegetarian diet why are they so sick and so inflamed like you pointed out with your initial case so I know exactly what you're referring to you feel like why am i doing all this stuff correctly and it's not working so was there kind of a ha moment or was it more of a gradual tinkering that you did it was gradual tinkering with my case so basically playing around with a macronutrient composition of my meals and sort of fall on my numbers at that time what I was doing is I was tracking my triglycerides every two to three weeks basically after making changes and that's something I do with patients is I check at least their

[00:12:12] Triggs once a month while making changes to see how they respond and it was amazing because as I was doing with this with my first few patients who had high triglycerides in some cases for over a decade within weeks we'd make some simple changes and see dramatic numbers which you're familiar with but at that time I was on sparring to realize it well I don't have to put them on fire breaks and fish oil I can just make a few tweaks to their breakfast and lunch and see these dramatic improvements in triglycerides and HDL as well how significant were these changes what kind of reductions were you seeing it's been three to four weeks we would see drops of one hundred and fifty points easily because their carbohydrate intake my average South Asian patients to the vegetarians 300 to 400 plus grams of carbohydrate per day some of my East

[00:12:51] Asians were eating upwards of 500 to 600 grams which is pretty typical in areas of urban China and things so it's really off the scales when you think of a staple amount of carbohydrates you're taking in now it's I think a little counterintuitive perhaps to a listener and probably to your patients at the time because the triglycerides sounds like fat how would you explain to them the relationship between carbohydrate and fat in that capacity a really good point and I think that's the most difficult thing because when they have high triglycerides the general help and for me they look at is will triglycerides or blood fat and blood fat is going to be reduced by eating a low-fat diet but that's where basically in my clinic I would show them the diagram of insulin basically I'd showed them the glucose sort of parking lot and glucose molecule and show the hormonal mechanisms of how glucose is basically converted into triglycerides within fat tissue so I wouldn't go into details but I basically show them the conversion and now what I've developed is a lot of animations that sort of show this process because a lot of people it's very tough for them to logistically understand how that conversion happens and unless they bond to that concept is very tough for them to just reduce the carbohydrates and be liberal about their fat intake so how many african-american patients were you taking care of at that time african-american patients at that time so interestingly when I was in

[00:14:00] Southern California quite a few but here in the Bay Area a handful at most yeah you I'm sure saw the stark contrast which is african-american patients can have type 2 diabetes Frank diabetes and yet have normal triglycerides yeah it's quite common right did that throw a bit of a wrench in your understanding of the system a little bit it did that's when I started looking at these patients more from a body sort of a habitus type standpoint and I started to realize it with my

[00:14:26] South Asian patients one thing that's very common in them is they have very slender limbs legs and arms are very skinny and compared to my african-american patients or others that develop an instant resistance they've got much more leg mask and much more lean body mass and I think that lean body mass does provide them with the ability to process and burn those triglycerides for energy more effectively whereas with my South Asians they have such a high degree of the visceral fat and when you look at cross-sections of african-americans Caucasians and South

[00:14:53] Asians when you look at the ratio of subcutaneous to visceral fat it's remarkable what the ratios are like and that's why South Asians and East Asians develop such acute inflammation insulin resistance of low body weights because the proportion of that visceral fat is significantly higher so take a moment to explain to people the difference between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat sure so when you think about those two types of fat I should like to think of it in three zones so basically you've got what we call the Esk at the superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue you've got the d scat which is the deeper layer of subcutaneous adipose tissue just right underneath the skin and then you've got the visceral fat and the way I explained it to people think of sort of a city versus a suburb so the subcutaneous fat really out in the suburbs the superficial the deep is a little bit further in so this could be basically

[00:15:38] South San Francisco and the visceral is basically around the organs and the way I explain it like that is because with the suburban fat you're basically you've got fat cells and you've got fat structures that are more lobulated and organized kind of like a tract home or strip mall type out in the suburbs and they don't have as much access to the blood supply when you get deeper into the layers of the deep subcutaneous fat and the visceral fat what happens is it's more loosely organized it's not as lobulated but they've got direct access to the liver in the bloodstream and that's really important when we think about subcutaneous fat often people think oh my god I hate my subcutaneous fat but really there's a subcutaneous fat it's a safety belt for us when you have larger subcutaneous fat stores it insulates you and protects you from having fat spill into those visceral fat stores so as much as my female patients complain about subcutaneous fat I'm like this is actually a safety belt for me because we don't want this fat to get into the inner city as we get to the visceral fat the other thing you want to be aware of is the concept of trans membrane flux and what I mean by that is two fatty acids that flow inside and outside of fat cells in subcutaneous fat it's relatively inert so you might get some fatty acid flux you don't get many inflammatory chemicals that come out of that fat but as you go into the inner city fat the visceral fat there's all types of cross traffic happening you've got inflammatory mediators your usual

[00:16:52] Oedipa kinds inflammatory chemicals you've got a lot of free fatty acids going back and forth so when you see patients of that body habitus you realize that even though they don't have much subcutaneous fat they've got quite a bit of visceral an interesting thing is I see a lot of couples so when I see

[00:17:06] Indian couples it's very obvious it's very interesting how the women are obviously sometimes 30 to 40 pounds overweight but their metabolic numbers look flawless triglycerides HDL everything looks great the husband's are real thin and skinny and you would think that their numbers would look good but their numbers are much more off the charts basically and it's because they don't have as much of that subcutaneous fat insulation everything is going directly to visceral fat and so this is one of the great holes in the notion of using something as simple as a body mass index calculator which probably directionally makes sense if you're looking at a very homogeneous population of Caucasians but starts to really fall apart in both East and South Asians in fact is probably east in South Asians in which this term skinny fat was probably first arrived and so in the example you just gave the hypothetical wife in that situation gets the traditional label of oh she's fat but as you point out she's not really metabolically in trouble she's not at an increased risk of diabetes cancer

[00:18:11] Alzheimer's disease nephal D or any of these other things but aesthetically of course she would love to be more thin her husband by contrast looks fine aside from the fact that he does have any muscle mass but it turns out he's metabolically at least according to the data probably in worse shape than the overweight individual who has comparable metabolic markers there's actually a study by Mitch Lazar and and maybe this is no longer the case maybe this has been updated but the last time I really looked at these data there was a paper in science that looked at these four phenotypes so external versus internal so you had lean versus not lean and metabolically well versus not well so that gives you a two by two so there are four categories so let's just posit that the best case scenario is to be lean and metabolically well and when you look at the outcomes of all of these the worst outcomes were in the lean individuals who were metabolically ill they actually did worse in the overweight individuals who were metabolically ill and I talked with Mitch about this quite a while ago

[00:19:14] I mean this paper is actually quite old and I think about it it's probably 2014 but the question I asked was is it possible that it's their inability to actually shunt and store some of that excess energy into a safer Depot of fat as you point out that is actually their undoing and at the time I think that was sort of Mitch's view that sounds like you share that vehicle I do for sure I mean if we think of this tissue overflow hypothesis where if you think of it as a watershed type thing it's subcutaneous - deep subcutaneous - visceral I've actually putting females aside I've seen a lot of overweight South Asians where I would expect in the early days that they'd have numbers that are proportionally worse but they're actually not that bad and so in my theory run that and based on that study - is they have larger subcutaneous fat stores to insulate them on top of that the other thing that's very unique about their body morphology is again I look at their legs their legs are more muscular because they're carrying around a lot more weight they've got larger thighs larger calves so I think the combination of the increased insulation from the subcutaneous fat and the elevated muscle stores from the legs is probably helping metabolize those lipids better but when

[00:20:18] I see those rail skinny we're talking BMI of 21 now I look at them I can literally predict their triglycerides I'm like this is probably through the roof because everything is in that visceral stored compartment so and then how closely do you see that association of where their triglycerides are to some of their glycemic numbers in other words can you look at that and get a sense of where they are on the spectrum towards having type 2 diabetes that's really interesting so I see a lot of discordance in my population so I see a lot of them that will come in with the triglycerides and maybe because I'm catching them at the early stage I don't necessarily see the glycemic impact of that and it might be 10 to 15 years away from that yes I absolutely got the ones that come in with full-blown pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes and triglycerides but I'd say the majority of the population that I see they've already got fatty liver they've got high triglycerides but their glucose looks fine and that is a really important population to really educate because I'm telling them now that you don't have pre-diabetes you have pre pre-diabetes and this is where we can make the most impact at this stage because you've probably got some preserved beta cell function you've got some compensatory hyperinsulinemia that's overcoming that but if we can really make a move here and just knowing that they have pre pre-diabetes because they all have like at least one family member that has diabetes so that's a one condition they don't want but they've never had a doctor that's taken kind of a non glycemic diagnosis of diabetes where your glucose is normal you're fine no it's your triglycerides and even before that it's just your darn waist circumference um can we actually attack it at that point and go from there and what about the hyperinsulinemia do you see in those patients normal glucose but elevated postprandial insulin so I got to be honest with you and saying that so in the early days I was checking those numbers quite a bit and I would see that

[00:21:58] I do insulin and glucose tolerance test and I'd see that I'm probably not checking that as often now but when I do check it usually they're fasting insulin least is off the charts so definitely they've got signs of early hyperinsulinemia yeah like I wish I could take a sabbatical for a year from Lai because I know we've gone over this we've even talked about this little bit through email I really feel like I'm trying to coalesce around I hate the term because it sounds so stupid but a unifying theory of metabolic disease of course the problem is in physics unifying theories are very neat and in biology by definition they're anything but unifying so it's actually kind of ironic that we would use the term because by definition it's bootstrapped together with well there's this subset and this subset and this subset and sometimes you can get a combination of these two and sometimes it's these two but but there are these different phenotypes I mean there's no denying the normal triglyceride normal LFT person who for some reason is not getting fat accumulation in the liver and therefore doesn't seem to have an excess of fat efflux from the liver but they're already on the way to diabetes if not already having diabetes by the way part of the problem is I don't really like the definition of diabetes I don't really like the definition of type two diabetes today I don't think that the hemoglobin a1c is particularly helpful so this is my soapbox so there's two issues I have with it one now that about a third of my patients are using CGM and it's being calibrated so we're using the

[00:23:21] Dexcom because it's much more accurate than the libra and it can be forced calibrated so even though the FDA says it doesn't need to be calibrated you can still force a calibration twice a day so you can really accurate readings when you put these things on patients for 90 days you actually find out what their average blood glucose is you then compare that to the imputed average blood glucose from hemoglobin a1c and if 25% of our patients are concordant that's pretty good 75% are discordant and it could be in either direction that's the point in other words for a subset of patients the hemoglobin a1c that you measure in their blood which imputes an average blood glucose is under estimating their average and in a subset it's the opposite this has led me to first and foremost be quite suspect of hemoglobin a1c I first noticed this in myself by the way I'm incredibly discordant I suspect it's because of my beta thalassemia minor which grossly overstates my hemoglobin a1c but again seeing the as many cases in the opposite direction you realize this test is helpful when comparing the difference between someone who's at 5.1 verses 8.1 it offers no fidelity between five and six in my opinion such an important point you brought up because I have patients that come in and we've made incredible transformations on every metric but they literally look at their blood reports these are very motivated South Asians who are very focused on numbers and grades and they're like I'm still not getting that a1c down I'm not getting that fasting glucose down to 99 and they obsess over that Peter they're like do I need to go more low-carb do I need to workout harder and and it's just a matter of listen metabolically by my definition you're healthy let's not obsess over this number and focus on bigger things so interestingly

[00:24:57] I haven't really incorporated CGM into my practice is something I need to do I've definitely prescribed it for some patients and I know you were nice enough to actually connect me and get me motivated to get one and I haven't done that yet so I think that'll be I'm sticking to numb fingers right now with lots of finger sticks for about today so

[00:25:11] I've got to get with the times I think you should and I think you'll be really impressed with I think and again maybe every patient populations a little bit different maybe my patients are a bit more motivated but who knows that's not necessarily the case I think patients find it valuable on two fronts the first is the insights are really impressive you just can't believe how much certain things can affect your glucose levels even the most benign thing like a handful of raisins or a particularly large Fuji apple or something like that and then conversely how eating the exact same amount of glucose with something else can delay that transit and slow it down and then of course how what you eat and proximity to exercise versus time of day versus how well you slept the night before so there's like the entire insight sphere and what I usually tell patients is at the outset the first three to six months of wearing CGM is 80% new insights and 20% behavioral modification which is the gamification that comes from once you know what to do actually doing it because you like the numbers but then you sort of get past that point and you learn most of them you're not getting surprised all that much and then the benefit actually becomes the behavioural one I've been wearing one of these things now for probably three and a half or four years so for me I'm not gaining new insights daily maybe every week I get a new little insight so maybe it's 10% insight related but the behavioral piece it's basically a walking Hawthorne effect I was gonna ask you about are you wearing it now more for behavior month yes I figure you've gotten all the insights but this really prevents you from megachitos or whatever year that's exactly right we have pretty clear metrics with where we want to be both in terms of average glucose in terms of standard deviation of glucose which we use as kind of a proxy for insulin and then in terms of the number of times you have excursions over 140 that becomes kind of another metric you want to avoid and so it absolutely curbs my behavior when I am wearing it which is most of the time I probably 300 to 330 days out of a year I'm wearing it definitely dials my behavior in absolutely so now going back to this point you've got these different phenotypes of diabetes and I think that the whole diagnosis of just relying on an a1c being above 6.5 is not very helpful because one I don't think I trust that number enough to hang my hat on it and secondly why is it that somebody who's got maybe an average blood glucose of 120 which wouldn't quite be at that threshold at a fasting level but has these postprandial glucose is of 200 why would we not consider that person to be at risk and when yet we don't treat that person in the same way so my view is basically to tell patients

[00:27:43] I'm not remotely interested in any of these labels they don't mean anything I don't actually look at hemoglobin a1c except out of the intellectual exercise of contrasting it with this cgm but instead it's that level of insulin fasting postprandial plus glucose postprandial with all of the kinetics that we can track and then layer it into this other stuff which is what's the inflammatory cascade look like because this is sort of what I was gonna get that is you have these phenotypes I think where you've got that person who's overweight who metabolically actually looks pretty reasonable and they're doing a lot of the stuff correctly but there's probably something going on at the cortisol level and this is another thing we see with the CGM is these very very high nighttime glucose levels in people who are otherwise eating pretty well so I guess it's hard to track that without

[00:28:31] CGM because the best the only glimpse you get is the morning glucose level which as you know can be easily a hundred and ten in someone who's metabolically quite healthy by other parameters do you see cortisol as being a bigger driver of that inflammation what else do you see I'm gonna throw some theories that yeah and I'm gonna run this by you as well too because even without CGM I noticed this pattern myself very early and I started know sitting in my patients and I started really focusing on them calming down their nighttime rituals getting off the devices doing some meditative practices in the evenings and checking their fasting blood Sugar's the next day and I clearly saw improved fasting blood sugars and and it makes so much sense Peter when you think about the fact that the liver is really in charge of what that morning blood sugar is going to be and the liver the cortisol is such a huge input to that and when you think about the process intellectually if these are individuals who are already insulin resistant presumably their adipose tissues have a lot of free fatty acid release and lipolysis so you've already got free fatty acids going to the liver to fuel gluconeogenesis now if you add cortisol on top of that cortisol has the exact same effect on adipose tissue right so you've got to sort of lip oolitic inputs a higher pool of free fatty acids going to the liver so that liver is primed to produce sugar so to me it physiologically makes perfect sense is very tough to make that case to patients because they want it to be their dime they're exercised they're like just tell me how many more cards I can cut out of my dinner or do I need to do this workout I'm like this is an emotional metabolic issue so I've seen that for sure and when we actually do influence those types of things and do those nighttime behaviors the numbers get better in addition to that what I've also noticed is sometimes when patients are too low carb with their diets sometimes that will trigger a reflex hyperglycemia and the way they're trying to game that is sometimes they'll eat some starches at nighttime and I was going to ask you even though that's making their numbers better in the morning it's sort of interrupting their fasts

[00:30:17] I'm thinking are we just gaming the numbers to make your report card better or we physiologically really doing some good in the body and that's where I get a little bit hesitant about just focusing on single-digit numbers like fasting blood glucose yeah it's funny you say that I definitely have a subset of patients who are actually coming to my mind just as we have this discussion who are really fixated on that morning glucose level I think it's tough I'm very curious as to what's going on I have reached out to a number of people who study this and I haven't really got a satisfactory answer yet but there's something I can't figure out in the liver and you alluded to it so taking a step back just for the listener a blood glucose of a hundred milligrams per deciliter means you have about five grams of glucose in your bloodstream that means if you have a blood volume of five liters which average-sized person has at a hundred milligrams per deciliter is five grams of glucose that's one teaspoon of glucose now that's not a lot that's a few minutes worth of metabolic fuel especially given that the brain is going to consume 25% of your total energy all in the form of glucose in other words the brain is taking two to three grams out of that five within minutes so if you can do a thought experiment and you clamp the portal vein you prevent the liver from putting any glucose into circulation an organism is going to be dead in minutes it is simply going to die of hypoglycemia so that's point one point two is how well this machine is regulated the difference between you sitting here now with a glucose of 100 milligrams per deciliter which we would consider perfectly normal and you sitting here with a blood glucose level of 200 milligrams per deciliter first thing in the morning which is frank type-2 diabetes do not pass go do not collect $200 diabetes that's a difference of one additional teaspoon of glucose in your bloodstream or another five minutes of metabolic substrate and again first thing in the morning that's being regulated by the liver why is it then that in the person would type 2 diabetes that liver can't just back off a little bit on its hepatic glucose output to bring that person from 200 down to 100 and if you ask that question it an even more subtle level outside of diabetes why is it that your patient or my patient or me or you wake up sometimes with a blood glucose of 120 versus 90 which is I mean we're talking now about milligrams of glucose in terms of difference so how much of this is being regulated at the liver how much of this is being regulated at the pancreas how much of this is being regulated at the muscles and I still can't really wrap my head around why this is happening and I certainly suspect that cortisol is playing an important role

[00:32:56] I think cortisol is a vastly underappreciated regulator of fat flux through the fat cell insulin gets a lot of attention because it's perhaps the most potent both on the side of lipolysis Andrea's Tara fication and we also can't measure things like hormone sensitive lipase easily so we can we have to sort of not about that much but and cortisol because it's such a pain to measure and we can't measure free cortisol in the blood we we just sort of loosely think about it but

[00:33:24] I can't help but wonder if that's playing a role now tracing fun who I spoke with about this he has a very interesting model of insulin resistance which is that it's not actually resistance it's just basically the storage tank is full so the elevated level of glucose is because the glycogen stores are basically tapped out and the elevated level of insulin is not because the insulin receptors and/or the intracellular mechanistic transducers are themselves quote-unquote resistant it's just trying to push harder and harder to get the glucose in that model by the way makes a lot of sense through the lens of the fact that even the most quote-unquote insulin resistant person has no difficulty putting more fat into a fat cell which is also signaled by insulin so what I like about Jason's model is it gets rid of the discordance between how can you have an insulin resistant muscle and an insulin sensitive fat cell mechanistically to which I've never had a compelling response have you thought through that particular issue it's interesting because that's exactly the model I use when I do education for patients it's very easy to just tell me about parking space muscles got a fixed amount and I think it makes a lot of sense in that sense I think one of the issues is when you look at these patients early on so if you look at the studies of normal glucose tolerance offspring of diabetic parents so these are normal glucose tolerance individuals that are relatively lean they don't have inflammatory markers so they haven't really shown many manifestations but the earliest changes you basically see is that they already have elevated levels of free fatty acid circulating so already you can see that in these populations whether the South Asians or

[00:34:59] Hispanics their visceral fat is already out putting a little bit of extra free fatty acid and we know that free fatty acid is a chemical signal for interrupting insulin resistance sort of signaling so at that point I'm thinking that yes it probably is a capacity issue but I think that early signal is limiting the ability of the muscle to really store that glycogen because it's already inhibiting glycogen synthesis basically at that level already so I think in people that don't have insulin resistance absolutely that parking capacity makes sense I think with people that haven't some resistance that makes sense too but we also have technology people that have had insulin resistance from in utero is what we're seeing in these populations they already have a very limited capacity and it's not necessarily physical they just have less because of the free fatty acid that's inhibiting the insulin signaling if that makes sense yeah I mean I guess the question is which comes first is sort of the thing I'm struggling with here and I think of it even more upstream which is frankly just looking at the liver I don't think it's like a particularly profound statement to say that the liver is the leading edge of the airfoil the liver is seeing everything at a speed and at a level that transcends everything it is the epicenter of our metabolism at least that's my view and when I see things like fat flux in the liver leading in the direction of accumulation that has to be a bad sign but of course then I can poke holes in my own theory by saying look at all the people who develop all of the other negative symptoms and signs but by ultrasound at least or even by MRI they don't have fat in their liver and they usually have normal triglycerides and yet they have these other issues that you're alluding to this is why I appreciate you saying that you truly don't understand insulin resistance because I think when people say they do understand it literally I've written diagrams of every possible in your heads in circles you step back thinking I really don't get this at all but it's true and there may not be one cycle because I think I was trying to find one process flow that would explain all these cases there could be multiple I mean we can see arrows and diagrams going in multiple directions and and I realize at a certain point that I need to understand this process but I'm probably not gonna figure out exactly for each individual patient I've sort of got to go for the low-hanging fruit and see what's gonna lead to the most meaningful lifestyle changes for them that's a good point to make because I think if you're listening to this you're thinking well if Peter and Ron are sitting here basically acknowledging they don't know what insulin resistance is does it matter and more importantly like what does it mean to me and so yeah

[00:37:22] I emphatically say I don't know what insulin resistance means anymore I have theories the theories are plausible if you permit me to wave my hands a little bit and acknowledge that there are going to be different categories of insulin resistance that will apply to different patients but I can't give you mechanistic explanations as to why but it's why I do tend to focus on hyperinsulinemia because I really when I talk to patients about the endocrine system I usually walk them through four of them they say broadly speaking let's look at this through the level of your thyroid system and so again we talk about what's happening between the hypothalamus the pituitary the thyroid and the periphery let's call that one system and I say let's now have the same discussion about the adrenal system again same sort of connection and then let's have a similar discussion about your sex hormones and then the fourth system I talked about is this system of fuel partitioning which of course has to do with how does the energy you consume get stored and how do you access energy and usually they get the first three but then it's that fourth one that's sort of like what do you mean by fuel partitioning and I say well first of all blood can only give us part of the answers here I mean you have to do some other metabolic testing to get the others but I said if we don't have a hard time talking about hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism so we can simplify this fuel partitioning problem by at least looking at one element of it which is hyperinsulinemia and in some ways that's why i still really favor the oral glucose-tolerance test again whether we should be using blue Cola or not the only advantage of blue coal is at least we have a standardized way for me and you and Joseph Kraft and everybody to compare our numbers but you could make a case that it's sort of not particularly reflective of the physiologic glucose disposal and maybe instead we should have the pizza tester give people carbs in a way that they normally consume them

[00:39:10] I actually have done this a few times I had a patient who named you made the point because this test doesn't replicate anything I do and I said yeah you're right I know and I explained to her all this stuff and I said well what is a real cheat look like for you what is blowing it up mean and she's like it's like two margaritas and five cookies and I was like okay well that's your next glucose tolerance test right now of course the problem is we still end up doing that test in the morning but even that's not the right thing if you really want to do this test correctly you would do the two margaritas and the five cookies in the afternoon or whatever you're gonna do it and in many ways that's what the C GM has kind of allowed us to do the C GM without the insulin is at least allowing us to see the glycemic response to the real-world challenge of this and while I still rely on the OG TT constantly my hope is that eventually we're going to be able to do more point-of-care insulin testing and there is actually work in that space being done and maybe we're done with this sort of glue Cola type test yeah to bring it back to your point I thought I kind of understood insulin resistance seven or eight years ago and I'm pretty sure I don't know but you know I'm finding ways to reframe insulin resistance because I think even in the early days since I developed it I had sort of this toxic relationship with glucose triglycerides and and as I look at more of the evolutionary literature you know there's a lot of theories including thrifty gene the Barker hypothesis and just to summarize for the listeners so when we talk about the thrifty gene this was James Neal back in the 1960s who came up with a concept that insulin resistance is basically a result of us our primitive ancestors living in feast famine type cycles and during feast periods what they would do is they'd store extra calories this really abdominally in-store calories is triglycerides so they can survive during times of famine it was a very popular theory back then but then there was never a putative gene found for that and then really when you talk to experts they say we never really had if you look at sort of evolution there were not large periods of famine that really could explain that sort of a genetic manifestation so that basically evolved into this concept of a thrifty phenotype or the

[00:41:06] Barker hypothesis and this is really based not really on genes but the fact that the intrauterine environment itself is what can trigger insulin resistance in heart disease and what David Barker found and this was in the nineteen twelve I think and what he found was he looked at a hundred thousand people in the UK and he looked at records that showed that birth weight was inversely proportional to mortality from heart disease and literally when they've reproduces they found this in every continent so low birth weight equals higher risk of cardiovascular mortality and early cardiovascular mortality and they found this in every continent except Africa and when you look at that and then you look at the work of dr. C s

[00:41:42] Yagnik and he's done incredible studies in low birth weight babies in India particularly Pune and he's found that already at a very early stage when the babies are born they're already shown fetal hyperinsulinemia their body habitus is already a small tiny fetal potbelly like visceral fat and very thin extremities when you check their skin fold you basically see that they're already have a limited subcutaneous fat when you compare them to Caucasians and so this whole concept has come up about insulin resistance is this really a response to in utero basically and then another theory that he came up with is a soldier to diplomat hypothesis which I found very interesting were initially we might look at this problem as being something that allowed us to preserve more glucose for brain function so insulin resistance really is a evolutionary adaptation that allows more glucose to be available so our brain can use it to really thrive and survive we always talk about our primitive ancestors in terms of musculature but you need to have adequate amounts of glucose reserves so you can go up the social hierarchy and you can lead a tribe and I spoke to

[00:42:40] Gerry reven about this early on so Gerry even he coined the term metabolic syndrome the late Gerry reven and we talked about the fact that what do you think is a role of insulin resistance and he agreed that there's probably some mechanism where it does help certain populations preserve glucose for brain function and when you look at the South

[00:42:56] Asian population interestingly they are the most highly insulin resistant country on the planet right now and interestingly if you look at sort of the metabolic shifts that are happening in terms of glucose and lipids a lot of these are basically trophic to the brain so dr. Yeoh genic he saw that basically this hyperinsulinemia we know that insulin and you've mentioned this before with IGF above the neck it does have trophic of an impact so if you're in your door and you've got elevated glucose and elevated insulin presumably it can have some impact on increasing IQ and intelligence in that period now obviously if it's an overcorrection of the system if you're flooding that child with lots of sugar and cards that could go the other way but it looks like there might be some adaptive quality students on resistance and those sort of help with brain function and cognitive abilities and again I'm more guilty of this than the next person but we keep doing this right which is we use the term insulin resistance right after we acknowledge we don't even know what it means and so what you're really describing is the hyperinsulinemia with compensatory high glucose so actually Jake Kushner just sent me a paper last week that I I don't want to say too much about it because I'm still going back and forth with him on sort of the interpretation but the paper is trying to look at mechanisms for why refeeding after carbohydrate restriction produces elevated glucose and unfortunately that I don't want to sort of criticize the paper too much before having gotten fully through it but my first reading of the paper is God they seem under fun they didn't measure they didn't collect urinary c-peptide I hear a lot of things they didn't do because it's the first order there's a question which is let's just pretend and the paper looks a carbohydrate restriction but I'm actually more interested in fasting so let's just take either one of those cases so either I carbohydrate restrict you or I fast you and then I refeed you why do you have this disproportionate glucose response initially is it because of the muscle being resistant to the effective insulin or is it because the pancreatic response is especially slow or is it something else is it a combination of these things these are very testable hypotheses and certainly the first thing I'd want to know and I can I don't think they did it in this paper which is sort of what I sent back to Jake the other day which is you'd at least want to rule out that it's not a blunted or delayed insulin response in Schley pancreas is you could anthem horrifies this anyway you want so do you have a point of view on that issue of why is it that someone who's let's just say for the purpose of this discussion carbohydrate restricted or in the case of our ancestors who were without glucose or without meals for days at a time upon reintroducing it look like they're hyper glycemic I mean they are hyper glassing right I mean this is all theoretical and for me if you look at ancestral and evolutionary sort of survival I think if you've gone through a famine period when your reef fed the brain is still the number one organ that you want to fuel and we know after feedings and carbohydrate feedings that the skeletal muscle is responsible for eighty to ninety percent of glucose disposal so so to me theoretically seems to make sense that probably the resistance is happening at the skeletal muscle level and that's what we preserving probably an over corrected amount of glucose for brain function so you would predict based on this study that if they measure it insulin would be normal the insulin secretion would be normal I think relatively yes and again obviously you can have mixed pictures but this is advanced enough you might see that but in a pure sense I would say you probably would see more of that with relatively preserved insulin we might probably have to do a clamp study to really make that come true so yeah I'm working with a guy who's got a device that can actually measure insulin and see peptide at point-of-care so one of the things I'd like to do on my next fast is when I break a really long fast use a standardized meal of glucose to refeed and then see what the glucose and insulin response is to that and after say seven days of zero input and contrast that with the same meal given in the context of being normal fed yeah that would be interesting yeah so so hopefully I'll get to that I might even get to that before this podcast comes out so if it's possible by the time this comes by gasma I will have already done that and maybe even talked about it another point to add up to look back this study but when you flood the system with insulin even in normal glucose tolerance individuals if you flood them for 24 or 48 hours they have a significant diminution of their beta cell function I mean it already sort of has a depressant effect on that and I think when you study patients that have even early stage and resistance they've got somewhat fatigued beta cell function already and coming back to those fetal studies they already found that even with fetal hyperinsulinemia the beta cells were just not as developed they're already showing some signs of early wear and tear just from in utero hyperinsulinemia so I think a lot of these individuals already have sort of a second-rate pancreas and that on top of that if you're flooding with hyperinsulinemia yes it's gonna cause some skeletal muscle resistance but there's probably some combination of some beta cell dysfunction along with that was there not a study and I don't even want to put out a year because I'm sure I'm wrong I think it was like 2013 that actually showed genetically that both East and South Asians had lower beta cell density genetically and that that feeds into what you just said as another part of the predisposition to almost bypassing the obesity phenotype so you go from because again you could think of this as the standard Caucasian path is normal to hyperinsulinemic to obese to diabetic and where these Asian populations they just seem to skip the obesity phenotype more often than not and they end up going metabolic abuse related which is could be partially explained by bypassing hyperinsulinemia if you have less beta cell either density or functionality in some way no

[00:48:34] I think that makes a lot of sense and am i right must my memory correct that there were studies demonstrating there was and I remember seeing the data in the South Asians it might have been in one study where they combined both populations so I'd have to look back at that but definitely I've seen other studies in South Asians about beta cell dysfunction that happens and there's a genetic link with that as well and kind of bringing it right back to where you talked at the outset the other study that I think is interesting is when you looked at the liposuction study this was in the New England

[00:49:00] Journal of Medicine I want to say it was over I think Sam Kline was one of the authors you took metabolically dysregulated people you did liposuction and I think they averaged about 30 pounds of fat removal from both the superficial and deep subcutaneous space which is all that you can access through liposuction and there is no metabolic improvement in the patient which again makes a very compelling case that it's not fat per se that is the proxy even for metabolic dysfunction in general it's this visceral pool effect exactly if you think of that subcutaneous like we talked about as being your safety belt you're kind of removing part of that safety boat so I would expect that that's not gonna have any impact because the visceral is where all the actions happenings and I don't know I doubt this is ever going to be done in humans but in animals has anybody done the liposuction of visceral fat and seeing if that improves metabolism or is it again the visceral fat is just a proxy for something even more sinister metabolically and molecularly I haven't seen that study yet this is a little bit related but there's a lot of interesting research on brown adipose tissue and I'm certain starting to really focus on this because coming back to evolution if you look at the patterns of migrations so if we look at our out of Africa migration from 70,000 years ago and when populations dispersed to different parts of the world the ones had dispersed further north into colder climactic regions when you look at their brown adipose tissue and the genes that determine that they've got significantly more brown adipose tissue and they've done studies to compare brien adipose tissue in South Asians versus Europeans and we've got significantly less brown adipose tissue and just to sort of back up for folks I don't know what Brian adipose tissue is Brian adipose tissue is actually metabolically active it's brown because of increasing density of mitochondria brown adipose tissue and newborns generates more heat to keep the newborns body warm so our populations and ancestors have migrated to colder climates they actually have more brown adipose tissue the resting metabolism is higher they can generate more heat and that thermogenic metabolism can actually account for at rest between 15 to 18% two calories burn throughout the day it's a pretty market and when you look at that and you think about migration patterns and insulin resistance the interesting thing is if you look at native population you look at the Inuit and Eskimos in the colder regions they've obviously got very low insulin resistance but then look at the

[00:51:17] Pima Indians and others that migrated to southern sort of areas of the world they have much higher risk of insulin resistance even with India when you look at the country itself in the northern parts that are near the Himalayas you have some of the lowest incidents of insulin resistance so there's a place called montipora which is near the himalayas and they have single digits basically in some resistance and diabetes the highest rates of diabetes in India are further south near the equator so Kerala has by far the highest

[00:51:42] I mean the prevalence er is up to 20 percent so it's all over the world you see this pattern and the brown adipose tissue is turning out to be really interesting because number one it's not only more metabolically active but it actually is a glucose disposal organ it can actually remove glucose from the system and they did a study coming back to this where they took rats and they took brown adipose tissue out of a rat and they basically put it in another rat and they showed insulin resistance was completely reversed basically just by brown adipose tissue transplantation and when you look at those two regions of

[00:52:11] India what are their phenotypic differences in body morphism composition so the phenotypic difference is typically in South Indians they're shorter and vertical height they tend to have a little bit more visceral adiposity so a little bit more larger potbellies in the north as you move further up north probably a little bit more lean body mass basically a little bit taller the skin type is well - in the South darker skin we see a lot more significant vitamin D deficiency when when I see these individuals they have a vitamin D level maybe three or four basically so way down in single digits and up north I don't tend to see that as much either so so there's interesting variations between those two and then coming back to the brain sort of hypothesis interestingly even though they're more insulin resistant in South

[00:52:50] India anecdotally they also have the most competent scientists and mathematicians in the south so a lot of the brain influx into Silicon Valley's coming from South Indian cities so I've had this discussion with I had this with Jerry before and I asked him that do you think there might be something about the fact that the most insulin resistant part of India somehow there's some sort of cognitive benefit they get from that insulin resistance and he thought it was an interesting theory we'll have to see but are there activity differences between them I mean you'd get the sense that the folks in the northern part of Italy near the

[00:53:18] Himalayas are also more active like there seems like there would be so many confounders it would be very different if you look at the populations in Kerala and southern India where it's more of a native sort of a village climate and the other thing that they have is that increased fish intake so they a lot of seafood but even in studies done in more of the rural populations where they are physically active they still see very high levels of insulin resistance but you're absolutely right there can be multiple confounders to sort of account for that but in general if you look at sort of the globe and you look at insulin resistance patterns the climate has a lot to do with it and it might lead to a phenotype of basically who can manage baseline adipose metabolism better in terms of generating heat now you brought up vitamin D so let's go down into that rabbit hole for a moment there's another topic my point of view has really started to change on so I've never seen a vitamin D level of three or four that's pretty impressive what risk is that person at and how are they living such that that's there I don't mean why are they alive I mean what is their lifestyle that is producing a vitamin D level that low a lot of it's obviously it comes down to their skin pigment so they're clearly not absorbing as much and then lifestyle wise most of them are spending most of their time indoors they work at high tech companies in their cars all day so you're not seeing this from people who are actually back in India per se necessarily working outside or not stuck in front of a computer all day even the ones that are spending time outside they're fully clothed so it's kind of a taboo to be in a tank top and workout and things like that in that population so even my patients are a little bit more physically active and outdoors or runners and they spend a lot of time outdoors they still have pretty relatively compromised vitamin D levels and some of that is vitamin D resistance some of it is just a fact that they're not absorbing enough and in the early days definitely I would replace anybody with that sort of level you have to replace but I wouldn't say that more is necessarily better I don't know if South

[00:55:00] Asians are adapted to have vitamin D levels of 60 or 80 plus it makes sense to get them between 30 to 40 anecdotally what I have seen and this is completely anecdotally is in some of those patients I definitely see that see reactive proteins do improve because vitamin D does have some anti-inflammatory effect

[00:55:16] I was hoping based on some of the studies that I came across and I'd love your input on this that it would help a little bit with glucose disposal because vitamin D does have some organic benefits at the muscular level I haven't seen that pan out in my patients the one thing I have seen as a pattern is it definitely has helped with hypertension

[00:55:31] I've definitely seen when I get vitamin D levels up in my resistant hypertensives we often see their blood pressure controls much better but I'd love your feedback on if you've seen any patterns when you've replenished you again you haven't had single-digit ones but I'm sure you see plenty of individuals with low vitamin D I've never seen anybody below ten I know I'm talking people like you that they're walking around out there but if I see somebody in the 10 to 20 range that would typically be low again I used to think that sort of forty to sixty was where people needed to be and I would replace people to get there I no longer do that I sort of just want people above 30 without supplementation is sort of my point of view now so I'm generally taking vitamin D away from people the problem is there's a really good sleep supplement out there that contains vitamin D and I would love it if it contained none or much less because it's confounding this and we're seeing people show up with vitamin D levels of 80 and 90 which is that just doesn't make sense to me that that's a place where we want to be especially if you're dealing with the patient again I'd love your input on just the higher rate of coronary calcification that we see in this population too so it does make me nervous to just drive there vitamin D higher there better so I'm pretty conservative with that number yeah I don't take vitamin D anymore and I think for years I took it I don't supplement anymore and my my natural place to be is probably in the 30s to 40s just based on any time I can be out in the backyard shooting if I take my shirt off I figure

[00:56:51] I'm getting my vitamin D that way but again I know that's not practical for everybody not everybody lives in a Southern California climate not everybody has the pigment that I do which basically means I can't get a sunburn if I try I'm unburnable exactly yep so I have that luxury that I don't think everybody does so no I'm still really trying to wrap my head around this but I would say the placebo effect is huge when somebody is a vitamin D level of 3 and all of a sudden 30 they're like man have so much more energy I feel great you know but that's more anecdotal but I don't know physiologically they're really getting some benefit yeah I haven't seen the blood pressure issue where our little sort of great trick on blood pressure is lowering uric acid that's huge I mean in fact I take such an extreme view on this that I don't even think one should use antihypertensive medication until uric acid is below 5 so if you got a patient walking around the uric acid of 7 who's got hypertension they've got to be on allopurinol first metabolically thick which by the way may or may not correct their uric acid doesn't necessarily do so especially if they use nutritional ketosis and fasting which you'll often see raise the uric acid level but the effect of uric acid on blood pressure is pretty profound and do you think that's more of a when you're correcting the uric acid you're addressing the underlying hyperinsulinemia or is there something independent about uric I know

[00:58:01] I think there's something quite independent about it because you'll even see this with just the use of allopurinol yeah so yeah if you were looking at the correction of uric acid with the metabolic correction right would say it's impossible to know but just with independent reduction yeah and Rick Johnson actually has a paper that's in the New England Journal of Medicine that goes through this case Rick's done some really interesting work you've talked about the Out of Africa migration

[00:58:24] Rick's looked at the uric ace mutation that occurred after we so one civilization left Africa to go to Europe it turned out that this mutation of uric case allowed us to store much more energy in the form of fat from fructose and one of the byproducts of that is generating uric acid but this became really a beneficial mutation to acquire because fruit is at it's ripe aesthetic so you could actually really eat a ton of fruit and actually store it as energy in the form of fat and you would generate uric acid along the way and it seems that only the subsets of our ancestors are the primates that developed that mutation we're able to survive these European winters and then come back to Africa and so he argues I think quite convincingly although I haven't had him on the podcast yet to go into this in gory detail but talked with him about this a ton and read his papers that it was this ability to actually turn fructose through de novo lipogenesis into fat as a byproduct to generate uric acid that's actually what allowed us to come back to Africa to have survived to European winter and then to basely proliferate so this ability to generate uric acid is not unique to all species it's something quite unique to those that came from the lineage of having to survive basically a cold winter without much food hey Peter real quick before if they get speaking of energy output the other thing that you see in insulin resistant individuals especially South Asians is when you compare them when you actually put them through exercise testing when you take age matched

[00:59:51] BMI matched and you check their submaximal vo2 maxes typically in all these studies you look at their vo2 max is correlated with their level of insulin resistance and they have substantially less vo2 Max output under sub maximal exercise and one of the things that's really interesting is with normal glucose tolerance offspring studies before these are wage you meaning the higher the degree of hyperinsulinemia the lower their maximal vo2 yes yeah exactly it's hard to tell sort of what the link is which way it goes with net association be true across the board are you saying that it's disproportionately the case so I'm sorry so there's two sets of studies so there is one hyperinsulinemic case but these are young lean people before they've developed any signs of insulin resistance so vo2 max looks like it's already a bit of a surrogate marker for early ins and resistance in these individuals and one of the things that you see is in the normal glucose tolerance offspring that have no signs of insulin resistance if you were to measure their ATP output the ones that just have a family history of diabetes their ATP output goes up by like five percent and the ones that basically have no family history at all again normal glucose tolerance it goes up by 90% so even the earliest stages before you've seen any signs of insulin resistance you're seeing significant mitochondrial dysfunction early on so that's another theory is is there something at the level of the mitochondria and it's hard to predict is this really something that's happening because of the increased influx of free fatty acids it's overwhelming beta-oxidation or is there something intrinsically wrong with oxidative phosphorylation etics expression so that's another theory this is one of my favorite topics today actually is what is our best proxy for mitochondrial function and right now outside of having a laboratory where we're going to do mitochondrial biopsies and complicated in vitro assays what we're using is a zone 2 fitness test and so rather than look at vo2 max which is by the time you're at vo2 max you are both anaerobic and aerobic you've in theory maximized your aerobic capacity but you've also now brought in a lot of anaerobic metabolism so what we're interested in is using lactate as a proxy to clamp lactate and figure out what maximum

[01:02:09] TP production looks like and the higher that number then I think we can say more comfortably the more mitochondrial efficiency you have the healthier you are so let me give you a practical example you basically have to do this on either a treadmill or a bike you could potentially do it in a rowing machine but it's harder to sort of clamp the power so let's just say you want to do it on a bike you would ride against a fixed load of power in watts and you sample the lactate level and so you do long stages so unlike a vo2 max where you're doing typically three-minute stages and you keep ratcheting up by 25 watts until they fail because there you're measuring in real time what their vo2 is but lactate has a bit of a lag because you're measuring it as a finger prick so you might do 10 or 15-minute stages and you have gradual increases and what you're doing is generating this lactate performance curve and what we think and I say we I mean I'm talking about that people who are doing this sort of testing that I'm learning from one of whom I'm actually gonna be interviewing hopefully soon in the podcast is looking at how much output can you generate while keeping lactate in this sort of 1.7 to 1.8 millimolar range and certainly once you're over 2 you're starting to escape the capacity that mitochondria a little bit it's hard to do lactate threshold testing because even there it's very complicated if you develop the whole curve you can't really tell someone's lactate threshold until you can follow them all the way through to full threshold and robic threshold but this is below that the point I want to make is if your lactate threshold is sort of in the 3.8 to 4.2 millimolar range this is definitely below that and this proxy really matters so we call this what is your zone two and so if one person can generate 200 watts while keeping lactate below 1.8 and another person is generating 140 watts while keeping lactate below 1.8 well that's a fundamental difference in mitochondrial performance and so I think that one training that system which makes more sense to me than training vo2 max training that system again I'm gonna do an entire podcast on this so I don't want to go too far down this rabbit hole but we're using three hours a week as the magic in that zone so three one-hour or four 45-minute sessions at that intensity but again you have to know what it is and it's empirical like I test my lactate on every single one of those sessions but of course I'm a freak you don't have to do that but even every two weeks to upgrade and figure out if you're moving in the right direction and again you can do it on a treadmill now for me on a treadmill I actually use a very steep incline and a brisk walk the proxy that

[01:04:47] I've noticed for patients is if you don't want to buy a lactate device to check your finger like your finger sticks a poor-man's proxy is zone two at this level is about the highest level of exertion at which you can carry out a conversation yep that's a decent proxy actually yeah it's not that far off I sometimes take phone calls while I'm doing my zone 2 bike rides because I'm on a stationary trainer and they're uncomfortable phone calls but not impossible I could probably do a podcast on it because I'm asking more questions than I'm answering I'd like to hear that podcast all right so anyway long winded way of saying look I think that there is definitely something to it I wonder if looking at zone 2 would be an even more sensitive indicator than vo2 because vo2 you can train that when I used to ride a bike a lot and I knew I had a vo2 max test coming up I could game the system which is for about a month before the test there are certain types of intervals you can train really allow you to blow up Plus you drop a little bit of weight because it's very dependent on your weight and so you could go from 60 to 70 on a vo2 max in a week and maybe out a week but probably in about 3 weeks you could literally have that much of a jump in vo2 max just by managing your weight and a couple of types of workouts but the zone to test takes longer it's a little more robust and also I think it's not diluted by the anaerobic piece that comes in yellow to max that's really eloquent yeah stepping back to lifestyle changes that I'd like to get your input on this as well but in my experience I got to see in the early days because I was seeing so many thin limbed Asians or phenotypes of insulin resistance and skinny folks and I was pushing weightlifting quite a bit on them and I think it still makes a lot of sense for them to just generate more leg strength and more glycogen parking space but what

[01:06:30] I've also realized over time is many of them although they did well initially because they were just so focused on weight training that they did become more deconditioned from a cardiovascular perspective and I think that really had an impact on insulin resistance in some cases a plateaued or we just were not able to get their glucose tolerance where we wanted so I'm finding now that

[01:06:47] I'm having to sort of go back and say okay we need to incorporate some low intensity steady-state cardio or some hit training and it's a delicate balance because one thing I would tell you is when my patients that are really into endurance running in specifically my Asian population I find that they were much more catabolic when they do too much endurance training so many of them that are racing for half marathons they lose a lot of muscle mass from doing that and we know based on studies and athletes that if you do a certain volume of endurance training you are gonna probably have amp activated protein kinase inhibition of Mamet or you're gonna see some of that happen but I think in these populations that rush hold is low they go into muscle I see it myself if I do a lot of endurance work my legs my pants are getting looser because I lose leg mass very easily so finding that delicate balance of yes we've got to build up your aerobic system but we don't want to compromise your muscle mass is sort of critical so and I see that different in different ethnic groups yeah that's interesting you would definitely have more experience than me with both South and

[01:07:40] East Asian populations my view is could I do get asked the question all the time what's more important strength or cardio and my first response is a glib one which is yes and my second response is I don't even know what that means to use the term strength or to use the term cardio aren't really helpful because they're so vague and you have to be specific it's sort of like saying what's more important food or water well it totally depends right so and strength does provide a lot of cardio benefit as we know too so it's not a black and white thing yeah I mean even just the concept of strength training can mean so many different things to so many different people so my view is if you care about living longer and again not everybody should maybe not everybody does I don't want to shove my framework down everybody's throat but if you want to take the long view and you actually care about making it to your 80's and 90's and performing really well being a super functional member of your family your community or whatever it is that matters to you you absolutely have to be visiting at least four different components of exercise the first being stability so this is the one that's most sorely missing and it's the one that is the root cause of most injuries that people have and it's the one that is actually the most interesting to me so it's basically the ability it's restoring the body to its natural ability to transmit load across the muscles preferentially and not the joints but doing that is that's a whole new way of training that we won't get into today the second is strength but again what does that mean and it's because you can have different types of strength but the most important ones are going to be the simplest ones which is the ability to hip hinge the ability to pull and the ability to push and all of those things require enormous stabilization so if you do those things without being stable you get injured so anyone who's doing those things and is hurt by them means they're not stable enough to be doing them yet so you have to go back to square one which is build the stabilization but everyone should be hip hinging pushing and pulling and everything else is grave if you want to do some bicep curls on top of that knock yourself out but at the end of the day it's push it's pull it's hip hinge and those things have to be done in my opinion by everyone then you move over into this pro tunc whoa cardio world and there are many energy systems and this is where I think people confuse the difference between athletic performance and training for life so if you're training for a 5k at the elite level that's a 15 minute race that's an energy system that is a person who is running slightly above lactate threshold and then well above lactate threshold that's basically what that race looks like if you're running a marathon which again at the elite level you're talking about two hours and twenty minutes two hours and thirty minutes would be incredibly elite that's a person who's running below lactate threshold until the very end the question is at the level of quote-unquote normal people people who aren't getting paid to run 5ks and getting paid to run marathons which i think is pretty much everyone listening to this you have to ask yourself what matters the most and in my view at that point you can simplify the problem greatly you have to be very aerobic ly efficient which comes back to this zone to area and then you have to have some anaerobic performance and that's where the high-intensity interval training comes in you don't actually need much of what's in between because the what's in between is very sports-specific so I think aerobic Lee and anaerobically at peak I'm in reasonable shape today but my middle zone what would be called my functional threshold power or in cycling they call it sort of sweet spot around that zone for me it's deplorable today but it doesn't really matter because I'm not interested in doing a race that's one hour long anymore I'm not racing at anything but I don't need to train the system that is geared towards that now there are gonna be people who push back and say no you need to be robust across every one of these energy systems and maybe that would be true if we had infinite time but if you have finite time and you have to prioritize and one of the things I do with any of my patients who are interested in this exercise and several have taken me up on the offer is I like to do an inventory of time in your life which is 168 hours in a week let's talk about how many of them you're sleeping how many of them are you thinking about and/or preparing meals all things have to do with food how many of them are you meditating how many of them are you exercising and how does each hour of exercise fit into those four buckets of stability strength aerobic and anaerobic and again for most people it's like 12 to 14 hours would be the upper limits of what they can put into exercise and if that's the case then I feel you've got to be laser-focused on that but I definitely want patients to accept the fact that it can't be one or the other you can't just go down one path or the other and there

[01:12:24] I think you do have phenotypes I think there are some people who just doing strength training can do pretty well some people who are just doing and again I hate the term cardio but just to make it a simple term who can do pretty well but I've never met someone who doesn't do better when they're putting them together yeah in these Silicon Valley companies where I go a lot of these individuals that have come from other countries I mean they have never even grown up doing organized sports so they don't have any infrastructure of balance or stability and then they'll join some sort of corporate bootcamp class and

[01:12:53] I've seen achilles tendons get ruptured I've seen rhabdomyolysis it's just and I've talked to HR about the fact that these individuals are not ready for this and it's an intensely competitive environment you're next to European and African Americans someone that's got an athletic background you're trying to stay up with them but it can create all types of joint dysfunction so coming back to your point about just stability and core and these things got to look at the picture holistically one issue I see is with Aging in the in population it's a pretty fatalistic outlook when you look at individuals that reach age 50 or 60 because their leg strength is so compromised they're already walking slower they're using a cane they don't even think about the possibility of how they can be so much more independent if they were able to train that system but you think again coming back to our issue about how ethnically they've already got smaller limbs and then if you've got insulin resistance on top of that I kind of think of as insulin resistance is also being anabolic resistance because you're not able to really accumulate muscle mass as well as you could it really creates a pretty depressing picture of how individuals age and become depressed later on in life so one of my things that when I give talks to multi-generational sort of audiences is really focusing on leg strength and balance I mean if they could just spend their time doing that and then with my busy execs in Silicon Valley types the ones that just will not add time to their schedule I'm like how do you integrate these activities while you're at work so can we get you in there's apps and tools that I use it can measure your squats you know I kind of measure that as a vital sign can we do this many squats by 12 p.m. can you do this sort of stretching or can we do some balance exercises then for stress management a lot of them refuse to meditate they're not gonna spend the time to do it so what I do is with my Apple watch a lot of them were Apple watches or they've got a Fitbit where they can track their heart rate and I teach them how to breathe in ways they can actually bring down their heart rate so I sort of call this act of meditation when you're in a meeting what is your average resting heart rate and I don't know if you've done this before but it's interesting when I commute to work or I'm sitting in meetings

[01:14:41] I think I'm calm and I look at my heart rates like 20 points above my resting and then I just breathe through that and all this and the number comes down and a lot of my patients that have done that throughout the day they brought their blood pressure down dramatically because now they're breathing the diaphragm doing a lot of things like that and once they get that concept they're like this is something that makes a difference maybe it is worth me doing some mindfulness or maybe it's worth me doing more exercise so it's kind of a hack that I use for the interview got these patients for like there's no way in hell we're able to add 20 minutes to my day well I'm like what can we do during your day that can actually be more impactful that might prove the case that this is meaningful yeah a lot to unpack there so it's funny there's a guy fall on

[01:15:16] Instagram I don't know him his name's Ben Bruno though and he's completely he might be like one of the best instagramers ever he's just so funny and I saw that he had a t-shirt that said every day his leg day and I was sort of bummed because that's something I like to say and I was like I would have to admit a t-shirt of that I already thought of it so I should just buy his t-shirt but I kind of agree with that ethos which is every day is leg day so for me it's like I'm gonna lift three days a week and I'm gonna be on my bike or a treadmill four days a week so seven days a week I am deliberately doing something that is working my legs I mean they're climbing hills on a bike and I'm always hip hinging so every one of those three days in the weight room has a hip hinge it's a deadlift a leg press a

[01:15:54] Bulgarian or something like you just have I wish I had less strong legs said no one ever at the end of their life so completely agree with you on that but again I want to reiterate if you try to do that stuff without cylindrical strength in the middle of your body your hosts near earth your you're just gonna get hurt so you're gonna hurt your back you're gonna hurt your hips you're gonna hurt your knees it's interesting again I think what you're describing that Visa

[01:16:18] Visa heart rate is kind of a poor man's biofeedback some people that are more slick will use heart rate variability but heart rate is a first-order approximator of that and certainly if you can lower your heart rate from 80 to 60 sitting in a meeting you're doing something correct right exactly and it's actually an elegant way that you do it which is you use that as a thin end of the wedge to make the broader case to make change you know I've never really personally looked at meditation I shouldn't say that I think I used to look at meditation as a tool to reduce stress again I have a bit of an issue with that terminology because I don't know what that means anymore is stress the external things that are stressors to me or is stress how I'm responding physiologically to those things and well I think certain types of meditation specifically mantra based meditations probably do more in the moment to improve those things my internal bias is really towards mindfulness which is a view mindfulness like I would view going to the gym it's just a training tool that often is uncomfortable and oftentimes is unpleasant but it teaches me a tool that

[01:17:25] I carry with me when I go elsewhere so sometimes I don't want a deadlift but dead lifting makes it easier for me to pick things up when they fall down in my backyard and similarly sometimes I don't want to meditate but the deliberate practice of this ability to observe thought and not react and instead examine it more closely and distance myself from it to see the thought rather than to be the thought that just turns out to be a more valuable tool to being less miserable in my life my predisposition is just to be a miserable human being so then meditation becomes a tool out of that and I think that's where a lot of people miss the point on meditation is it's mostly just a tool to be less unhappy yeah agreed and as much as that's desirable yeah absolutely and I think you brought the key point a lot of individuals think stress reduction means that you're magically gonna eliminate an external stress so when I do a lot of seminars I talked individuals and about the fact that all of us hitting the room have X amount of stress but a certain percent of individuals in this room are gonna get high blood pressure glucose abnormalities some sort of chronic health condition as a result of that so if we can train our systems to not be as reactive and responsive to that external stress that's really what we're looking for and the heart rate I know is apply used to do a lot of HR be monitoring early on but the heart rate just makes a case that my god you can do something and actually influence your own physiology and there's other ways I mean when you were a continuous glucose monitor I don't know if you've ever tracked the fact that when it's elevated have you ever noticed after mindfulness or doing something that's meditation based have you been able to influence your glucose no but the opposite is absolutely correct so it's very easy because I think it's much easier to raise glucose than to lower it yeah so there's no question that I can be in a distressful situation get angry about something and then watch my glucose go from 90 to 120 in a matter of two minutes I mean that is not at all an uncommon finding and that is again yet another awesome feedback tool for me to be reminded of oh wow you let that whole thing get to you and look at the price you're paying for it exactly because most of my patients were left brainers I mean I can't go through the usual sort of meditation mantra based talk but first I'm like what are left brain things that we can do is it glucose is it your heart rate your HRV and once you make that case then you can sort of buy them into other types of practices you've written quite a bit about sort of energy fatigue stress management you have something the five s's that you've talked about yeah so basically if we focus on and things like stress sedentary activity sleep these core habits because many of my patients that come in that exposed to my work they're very focused on sort of the diet exercise axis but the other elements have been sort of ignored meaning they're interested in those things even before they come to you that's sort of their bias well it is because a lot of them have read my book or if they've watched my videos so that's the part that they can focus on the most the ones that have not been exposed to my work at all I've got to start from scratch but many of the individuals that have at least got that down to a foundational level they tend to put the stress and sleep on the sidelines and and I'm sure you've had patients before too where they literally just want you to add enact exercise or tell them what to eat but the minute you bring up the stress word their eyes glaze over right they don't want to even hear or deal with that at all so so I've had to find sort of innovative ways and practices that they can use to sort of incorporate that in their lives so they can make more of a meaningful impact and so focusing on those other essays has been sort of key and one thing that has really happened in my practice is a lot of my patients bring their family members in so one thing about Indians in particularly they don't like to come alone to their visits they'll bring their spouse they'll often bring their parents or their in-laws so I sometimes have four or five people in the room and man Peter those can be some pretty intense sessions because initially it starts off quiet I hear about what the issue is and then ask a couple of probing questions and all of a sudden all the family tension comes out because what I'm not realizing is when I see a patient individually they come out nodding their head they've got my prescription and plan but what I realize on the back end is there's a mother-in-law at home that's doing all the cooking or a nanny or there's a family member that's visiting for six months that's causing tremendous amounts of stress so when you see all the generational elements you realize that wow this is much more challenging than just looking at one individual and and if you can engage that whole family unit and it's interesting because of all the multi-generational issues I can talk about the fact that you know what this daughter this teenage daughters got PCOS dad's got corn ER disease you've got pre-diabetes this is a spectrum basically all right this is insulin resistance across different lifespans and it's pretty powerful because when they get that concept and how it manifests with these different conditions they realize that they've got to make multi-generational changes otherwise if you just focus on one individual it sort of gets lost in then and how often are you seeing PCOS so I don't see many teenagers in my practice but the interesting thing is when I talk to parents adults and I mentioned PCOS a either their daughters got it or when I go through sort of the checklist of symptoms they're like they probably have it and I've talked to some endocrinologist who've said in different parts of very in Fremont in particular they're seeing probably 25 to 30% of Asia news probably have some manifestation of PCOS what do you think is the root cause of it so on again coming back to insulin resistance I actually just like you hate the word type-2 diabetes I hate the term polycystic ovarian syndrome because I really think insulin it should be called insulin resistant ovarian syndrome because I think really it's coming from again hyperinsulinemia so really the effects of insulin on the ovaries particularly the thecal cells is causing the testosterone release and that's leading to all the different manifestations and and for a teenage girl aside from all the issues with type 2 diabetes and heart disease later on for these teenage girls with facial hair with obesity with acne with emotional disorders from this condition is absolutely devastating and when I look back at my childhood I kind of remember having family friends that a lot of guys would make fun of because they had facial hair and looking back I can already peg in my memory at least a half dozen girls that I grew up with it probably at PCOS but they had no idea and I knew what it was called nobody knew what was called yeah and how much of it do you think is insulin versus IGF effect I don't see it in my practice very rarely but it's one of those things that always somebody in your practice has a friend or a relative so it sort of tangentially comes across my radar but

[01:23:20] I'm quite naive I mean basically when we implement the insulin sort of management strategy through lifestyle in many of these cases we see it reversed so I think IGF definitely plays a role but again if you implement a lifestyle that's gonna lower in some levels and improve insulin resistance many times we see them get off medications it's so reversible in so many of these cases which makes it even more convincing to me that insulin resistance is really a major root cause but I'd have to look deeper in the literature to sort of look at is it more insulin or IGF there might be some overlap between but there's another phenotype here's this idea I'm sort of working on which is you have one category of adiposity which is pure excess energy intake it gives someone access to unlimited food and give all the hedonic pleasures that come with it there's a phenotype of adiposity there's a subset of people whose bodies will autocorrect and reduce intake and I suspect most of us would not in other words if you put me in an office with unlimited or put me in the rat cage with unlimited food I'm just going to get obese and it won't matter a whole heck of a lot what macro nutrient composition you're giving me by the way I don't know that that's necessarily true for me because I know from being on ketogenic diets if I eat an unlimited quantity of purely ketogenic food I actually get leaner so

[01:24:33] I know there's something regulating in me that will sort of control intake but that goes out the window if you give me unlimited access to M&Ms I can't regulate that so then you have sort of let's just loosely call that sort of the diffuse energy abundant intake we're not gonna go into that lots of people have talked about that the second phenotype these are the people that really respond well to carbohydrate restriction they are generally the hyperinsulinemic phenotype so you take someone who has adiposity coupled with hyperinsulinemia even though by the way

[01:25:02] I think a follow-up study by Christopher Gardner did not find this though his first study date is East that he did find this I could offer reasons or critiques of why I think the follow-up study did not find this clinically I still see it hyperinsulinemic people respond very well to true intermittent fasting which is real periods of fasting and carbohydrate restriction they respond really well then you have another group of people who don't seem to respond to either of those two they're usually female and not male by the way and you reduce calories and/or carbohydrates and/or add fasting and it doesn't matter their metabolic rate continues to slow to match whatever you do now the PCOS throws in another layer of complexity but let's assume you've already this person does not have PCOS this phenotype I find is the the risk of oversimplifying there the sleep stress dysregulated group and the only way I've been able to move the needle for that type of patient is the following you still have to do all the blocking and tackling on all the nutritional stuff you can't back off that so you're still doing some amount of time restricted feeding some periodic fasting carbohydrate restriction you're doing all of the right nutritional things oh we're also sort of loading them up with monounsaturated fats reducing saturated fats but they have to sleep eight hours a night they have to exercise every single day and you have to figure out what it is that is driving their stress and sometimes it doesn't even manifest overtype record icily Mia and on top of that it takes a long time so then you have to get them to buy into that strategy because if they don't get results in a month the tendency is to give up but if you look closely they've lost four pounds in a month and they might on the surface think well it's only four pounds but you realize no no no you don't understand you're gonna potentially lose 25 pounds in a year if you keep this up but you have to stay the course it's a very stubborn oh and then the other thing is they generally have high inflammation yes and it's not sky-high it's just fibrinogen is a little elevated CRP is not normal high right and there's some thyroid dysfunction usually that goes along with that yeah interesting and you're seeing that more at the TSH level or even pre

[01:27:15] TSH so if you're just checking antibodies already you're starting to see thyroid odda antibody use and 2b that's already a marker so you're right you sort of break it down is this really more insulin resistance is it more autoimmune inflammation and it's tough to sort of make that out but sometimes those thyroid antibodies can be very early marker of autoimmune and which ones are you looking at and so I'm looking at your typical anti TPO antibodies and thyroid globulin is well-tuned so you can pick up on that question and are they when you say elevated do you mean elevated even at the level of what the lab says or even are you looking at upper limit if normal would still be elevated I'm looking at upper limit of normal so and sort of tracking that and it's interesting because many of my female patients because they've been aware of this if sort of follow that over time so we can see the trends sort of go up before the

[01:27:56] TSH goes up so that might be sort of a marker other things we see are just GI dysfunction a lot of eczema in these patients too so these are other sort of audimute manifestations so you're right when they have that inflammatory component it makes it very difficult because insulin resistance alone just fixing that problem individually is not necessarily gonna protect them from weight loss and a lot of that inflammation causes those fat cells to especially the subcutaneous fat it looks like it has inflammation looks like it has a direct impact on subcutaneous fat in terms of the ability of subcutaneous fat to really release free fatty acids so why do we see this more in females so if I picture every patient I know that fits the type of that lab I got get they're all women and it's tempting to say well it must be an estrogen and testosterone access issue but I'm not convinced of that I think those things play a role but there's something else and I can't understand why I'm just it could be just small end and I'm being fooled by the relative small sample size but why do you think you're seeing this or I'm seeing this disproportionate as myself this question so much but I think it comes back to evolutionarily if we think about women's sort of procreation purpose in terms of being able to store fat enough having fat stores basically for lactation I think there is sort of a larger amount of subcutaneous safety belt for women and the issue is you're right after menopause I think that the big problem is before menopause we're not seeing the manifestations with instant resistance but after menopause all of a sudden it catches up right away so we sort of lose that protection but in the early stages when you're in those fertility years I think that subcutaneous fat is really helping to propagate basically reproduction I think that's the main purpose but coming back to I'll tell you why I'm convinced about the stress axis as being a major target here as many of my women that have been doing ketogenic diets are working out like crazy they're seeing no results oftentimes I'll go back to India for three or four months and I tell them while you're in India just forget all the rules do your best to sort of stick to the plan that you can but let's just monitor maybe your blood Sugar's a little bit in your body weight and I can't tell you how many people Peter when they've gone back to

[01:29:53] India to sort of be in their family they've lost weight and they're eating double the amount of carbohydrates what's the main differentiator well they're back to their tribe their family they're probably sleeping better they're eating a little bit less processed foods but more carbohydrates but they're just in their native place now whereas when they come back here they're isolated they've come back from a huge family they're here with all the independent stressors of Western life and that is just so more obesogenic and I've seen so many cases that I'm basically convinced that that's Russ exes is a huge part of obesity if you had shared with me that story which by the way now I've seen myself so if I had seen that story and or heard that story five years ago I would have come up with ten other plausible explanations for it and today

[01:30:34] I think the one you have offered is by far the most compelling I mean and I don't know why I would have rejected that five years ago it's just it's too touchy-feely I can't measure it enough I don't know what it is but I do agree that the effects of how we internalize stress do more damage than I've ever understood and perhaps part of why I've rejected it is it's not measurable because it's not just about cortisol and maybe if we could have real-time of catecholamines we might see other signals there but yeah I couldn't agree enough and the other thing is now that we are tracking sleeps so much more closely we use the aura ring which is I think very good at measuring duration and probably reasonable at measuring stage just looking at duration just forget the staging and by the way for that matter I think many of the sleep device you don't have to be your Apple watch give me your Fitbit it could be whoop or any of these things they're all pretty darn good nowadays at measuring the duration of sleep there is a fundamental difference between a patient who is sleeping 6 hours a night and a patient who is sleeping eight hours a night and what I find really amazing I saw a patient yesterday actually who we were reviewing his numbers and we do it in monthly box so we say okay so for the last 30 days you average 6 hours 12 minutes of actual sleep and he's thinking that can't be right I'm in bed like and I said let's go through your routine tell me everything what time do you get into your bed on tell me two nights ago what time did you get into bed okay what did you do what time did you get up and you realize actually you think you're in bed eight hours you're not because part of that time in bed you're putzing around reading your trolling your phone sleep efficiencies horrible yeah so yeah so that person who's truly getting six hours of 12 minutes of sleep at night you get that person up to 8 hours of sleep at night and make no other change it's mind-boggling the difference especially if you could do that let's see what that looks like after 3 months and so yeah this sleep stress thing is kind of crazy one quick thing on sleep too I just want to mention is the correlation that I see especially in

[01:32:36] Asian patients and South Asians between insulin resistance in sleep apnea that's been a huge factor and a lot of what we face even when you screen for sleep apnea often you are using body mass index criteria but you often will find overt sleep apnea with a BMI of above 23 it's a chicken or egg thing like is it the sleep apnea that's triggering insulin resistance or vice versa but but clearly sleep apnea intermittent hypoxia is a major inflammatory stimulus and often when that has been corrected whether it's through lifestyle changes or through CPAP we often see glucose numbers get so much better so all along was really intermittent hypoxia during the night do you think that hyperinsulinemia per se plays a causative roll in sleep apnea that's the controversial question nobody knows really what starts what my theory would be that it probably does have somewhat of a causative link but yeah it's very tough to say and there's a lot of people that argue on both sides of that so I lived in the Bay Area twelve No eleven years ago I spent six years of my life in the Bay Area I've been gone for 11 years I don't recognize it anymore so when I'm here it's just it's not the place it was over 20 years ago when I first came here for medical school it's clearly one of the most exciting places in the world if you're bent is innovation and all the things that come from here but it strikes me as a really hard place to raise kids probably a lot like New York would be and maybe to some extent like Southern California is what's the trickle-down effect of what you're seeing on your patients on their kids the way I sort of came about this was I still remember a patient family encounter where I had a woman who was 47 and she had a first heart attack and she read my book came to see me with her parents and her child by the way can I interrupt for one second I do want to come back to this story this reminds me of something you said please 20 minutes ago and I forgot to ask you but yeah are you seeing an association between the LP little-a of your patient population which is much higher than the general population and any of these other metabolic dysregulated or is the higher prevalence of LP little-a in your patients and the higher prevalence of hyperinsulinemia uncoupled even though when you look at worldwide studies of incidence of LP LaLanne in

[01:34:42] South Asians it looks like they are a population that's at risk for elevated LP LA but I clearly see quite a bit of uncoupling I checked that number quite a bit because some of my patients have a family history of coronary disease but many of them have normal LP lays and still Scott high insulin resistance definitely there are those that have elevated LP lolei and their risk is multiplied by that but I see plenty of cases where LP Lily is not linked so you're not you're seeing those as uncoupled in I didn't risk factor I do yeah and this woman who's 47 with an MI was elevated LP little a she was not actually she had a family history her LP

[01:35:13] Lily was perfectly fine Wow yeah but the reason that this sort of emotional axis came up was her parents were in the room and they basically told us that our daughter she just cannot slow down she had this heart attack she did six months of cardiac rehab and she's back to where she was before and the parents are like we don't understand how we can slow her down she's a workaholic she's just burning both ends of the candle and then it was interesting because she made a comment during that visit that mom and dad you guys always taught me never to slow down when I was growing up you told me to be the best in everything that I did maybe if you taught me to slow down then I'd have an easier time now and that was like a moment where I sort of sat back and thought wow I've never thought of it that way that the way we raise our kids early on might actually set a pattern for how much of an accelerated life or how much of a stressed-out nervous system they might have later on and as

[01:35:57] I've talked to more and more families here in Silicon Valley I'm realizing that it is a lot of the behavioural patterns that were instilling our kids are kind of setting the foundation for insulin resistance and inflammation early on we see so much fatty liver I'm starting to see hypertension adult hypertension and teenagers that are just going through their junior year and that's something I'd never seen before and we just realized that a lot of her parenting patterns either in Silicon

[01:36:20] Valley are kind of instilling these sorts of behaviors and they're already manifesting with adult health conditions early on in life so that's something I'm really that's why I'm very open to having people bringing in their kids bringing the parents and trying to wrap our heads around what is it that's happening here and that academic drive for excellence the high expectations they said there's one concept I call pyramid parenting where a lot of people that immigrated to this country they feel like okay if I made it from India to basically work here for a high-tech company my child what these opportunities should be able to outdo that they should be running that company and that's kind of ingrained even my dad when you came here from a village in

[01:36:52] India he was like you know if I made it here and I'm a pulmonary critical doctor you should be running your own Hospital like that pressure is always there but we don't realize how much pressure and what damage that can do and even the Asian and Indian population now that I'm exposed to the more we're seeing opioid abuse we're seeing all types of substance abuses because they cannot deal with the pressure that's being put on their shoulders so it's turning in there quite a crisis my wife and I now give a talk to high-tech companies in schools and it's called basically is your child a startup because we often give the analogy that we often treat our kids like startup companies we back them with resources and funding we expect them to do great things go to Stanford run this company and we don't realize it we're not even giving them an opportunity to grow up and just be a normal child and it's having a toxic effect and as we've given this talk I get emails from so many teenagers about the fact that they feel suffocated my dad keeps showing me TED talks on resilience I don't know if I can handle this anymore I just want to know it's like we're we sort of draw the line and it's really had a major impact on my parenting because it's a little bit in my DNA how many kids do you have

[01:37:49] I've got identical twin boys and they're 15 so they just they're literally finishing up their freshman year in high school so it's amazing how many stories you hear about what's happening so I just finished reading the coddling of the American mind have you read it no no it's a great book and of course it's dealing with a slightly different issue which is the title of the book suggests is how we're basically producing a very fragile gen-i so their thesis is that a lot of this sort of ridiculous over-the-top political correctness that we're seeing at a handful of elite institutions that's I mean I had to actually skip some of the stories in the book because they're so upsetting of the completely extreme responses that some of these students have had towards relatively normal behavior they're talking about this as being this sort of gen I so it's not the Millennial it's the I think it's the kids born post 95 actually and they tie it into a lot of the helicopter parenting sort of stuff and this sort of overly protective stuff but what you're describing is a slightly different variation on that which is not just that they're being overly protected or coddled but overly pushed do you think that is just unique to the Silicon Valley or other areas of equal prominence no I think it's pervasive Silicon Valley is a bit of sort of a phenotype but I think it is pervasive because if you think about how we look at our kids for many individuals the kids are an extension of their ego like even if you talk to the most modest individual you get them talking about their kids and they can go on for hours right and as funny as my kids are going through high school I'm having direct flashbacks into certain moments and stages I went through in high school and I think consciously and subconsciously sometimes we might push our kids to do things because we might have suffered something like maybe not being athletic in high school didn't get me to be more popular so now I'm gonna push that down my kids and we're doing it with good intentions in mind but if we don't realize the fact that maybe this individual is not inclined to do organized sports and athletics me making them feel less because I'm pushing them so hard to do that can have really devastating impacts so so I think this problem exists everywhere but here in

[01:39:51] Silicon Valley that problems on steroids and I'll give you another anecdote I had a teenager reach out to me who is not motivated by school at all he's like a junior there's a concept of not helicopter parents but they calm snowplow parents and New York Times did an article on this and snowplow parents just pave the way for their kids so they can go to whatever college and the student told me that one of his friends who's a total slacker what basically has happened is his parents being entrepreneurs they used the designers and the software architects in their company to build an app for him so we can put on his resume that he basically ran his own startup company so these sorts of things are happening so literally people are creating pseudo profiles and when all this news came up about the Lori

[01:40:28] Loughlin case and everything that happened I know it enraged everyone but here in Silicon Valley I see that many of us are creating pseudo profiles of our kids they're just kids but we want them to look like there are early entrepreneurs or there are stellar athletes but they're just kids and many of us are pulling up the snow plows and sort of creating these expectations and

[01:40:45] I think it's just not a healthy way I think the whole College Admission process is a complete mess it really brings out the worst in individuals and it's too much pressure on the kids I couldn't agree with that more I guess with my youngest turning 11 this year I'm hoping we got a few more years for it to work out some of the kinks before we have to her right sort of deal with that stuff it's pretty tough night what part of the country you grew up in I was born in New York and then I spent two years there seven years in Philly and then came over to California for that so and so you alluded to the fact that you already sensed this from your dad your dad's an immigrant and he could still figure out a way to become a doctor in the United States so you becoming a doctor would not be considered an equal achievement it had to be one better than that do you think that that dynamic has been amplified today or we're just more aware of it today I think it's amplified because the possibilities are endless literally for my dad it was like me being a physician that was probably enough of course he wanted me to specialize I did general internal medicine he was pulmonary critical care he's like Ron you should be a cardiologist you're gonna make more money and do fine but here in Silicon

[01:41:47] Valley it's not even enough to be a doctor it's like doctors here at blue collar workers when I went looking for a house when our real estate agent found out my wife and our physician she's like you're not gonna be able to find a house I'm like what are you talking about for both doctors she was right you know we had were getting outbid by all these high tech employees and things so here I think the scale for greatness is so much higher and I had a neurosurgeon come see me in the clinic and we were talking about this and he's a patient of mine and he told me that you would think that your surgeon would be enough but my dad sometimes is like why can't you be more like Sanjay Gupta he has his own TV show and he's written a few books I'm like shed seriously I spent so much of his life to me brain surgery and still of dads giving him a hard time I'm sure there's a lot of Atul Gawande stories out there too are you just a surgeon why can't you be like a tools and do you think this is specific to either Asians

[01:42:35] South East or East Asians like do we see this with Caucasian families the same way we do when I used a word Asian we actually put quotes era quotes around it we can call an Asian for more parenting but here I see it for example with a lot of individuals of other backgrounds in sports they invest so much time in ours and resources into their kids doing sports and what we see and often I see this in the clinic and during talks is a lot of these kids they're not really growing adequately because they're spending so many hours of their day training they eat a garbage die because they're running between math tutoring sports and all this so I think everybody has sort of their own dream life for some people it's their dream to have their kid win the spelling bee and for others is to be like a top notch runner soccer athlete and if they've got the motivation the resources and you can do that in a balanced way grade but many times what we're seeing in high school is they have so many activities that by the time they come home and they're doing their homework they're going to bed at like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning and that's something for us we do not compromise bedtimes like we hear from other parents said you know what in high school your kids are gonna have to go to bed at 2:00 in the morning but so far they're just freshmen maybe that'll happen but I'm like usually those kids go to bed that late they are having other issues they're not able to organize themselves they're not able to focus on their tasks they've got their cell phone next to them and they're looking at my kids have affirmed this I said some of their friends are watching an episode of Game of Thrones at 1:00 in the morning just as a study break and then they jump back in their books at 2:00 in the morning so when their parents tell me oh he's got so much homework I'm like is he really doing a lot of homework is there a lot of other ancillary activities happening so yeah one of the other things that sort of jumped out at me from the book I mentioned a while ago that calling the

[01:44:02] American mind is the dramatic reduction in play time that kids have and I don't know I just think about when I was a kid my parents knew what the hell I was doing any time all we did was screw around oh you were always playing we played you know I grew up in Canada so hockey was sort of the only thing that mattered so all we did was play hockey all the time you were always playing street hockey you're always playing ice hockey you were always sort of foot hockey so at recess you're playing foot hockey which is just kicking a tennis ball around pretending you're playing hockey but really playing soccer with a tennis ball and then you'd come home and you play street hockey and then you'd go out and have ice hockey organized hockey in the evening and we never had tutors and we never had exactly I don't know we just you know you're bringing up a key point because you did sports for fun and many of the teenagers are too getting so much pressure we must have patients like this that were former athletes many of them don't know how to exercise for fitness and they minute they leave high school they're not gonna exercise they were like so burned out on the structure and the pressure from playing organized soccer or basketball at football they just can't deal anymore it's not even a source of pleasure and I want to bring up the other issue because I think this is key is instilling hobbies so for example our kids were into music very early on we got them a recommended piano teacher and this piano teacher basically a very structured approach to music and literally she kind of told us that if they follow this certification process for piano they can put that on their college resume and I didn't even realize that this even existed and then we're like you know what they're not even enjoying it let's just get rid of her and let's get them like a rock keyboard instructor or somebody else and literally we brought somebody else in they taught him how to play Star Wars music anime they loved all the stuff and now for their study breaks they love playing piano and I know that going forward after college any time they're stressed if they're gonna play music my roommate in college he went the track of falling piano first for college admissions he's never touched the piano since because all Lea's memories of is just the pressure of performing having to fill out these evals and scoring on exams for piano it's like we're taking the joy out of a lot of things that should be hobbies that we use for stress reduction later we've got to really be aware of that yeah I get pretty stressed out actually just thinking about being a parent

[01:46:04] I think it's uh I probably need to visit this topic more in the podcast because there are lots of books I'm reading on this topic and they're kind of depressing actually because of a lot of these trends that you see so you'd have to separate out the sort of societal trends that we're seeing which almost without exception or in the wrong direction there are some exceptions to that and then balance that with well what do you do as a parent because in the end all I've got is control over some control not even complete control of course I have some control over three kids and then there's this piece which says well you can I

[01:46:36] Roenick Lee screw that whole thing up but try too hard to do the right thing like okay guys it's time for more unstructured play let's go outside and not play in a structured way yeah and go you know it's so it's like you're right so one skill that we know that we need to teach kids that's going to lead to their happiness is their ability to look internally in sort of cognitively reframed situations so when they're dealing with stresses so one key thing is when I've talked to therapists here in in Silicon Valley they tell me that watch out for the kids that are quiet when they're too quiet if they're not really interacting they're not talking to you they're just following the rules compliantly those are the ones you have to watch out for and what's the reason because you're ruminating they have nobody to express their emotions to so they're internally thinking about these things day and night having two boys both of my kids they naturally sort of had that habitus of being more internalized so we've had to instill activities and again do it in sort of an undercover fashion to make sure that they're expressing their emotion so one exercise we often do sort of covertly skal roses and thorns where we sit around the table and we'll sort of go through and talk about a few good things that happened a few bad things that happen so I read about this and again I sort of tried the exercise my kids were like oh my god dad you're just doing another one of these things but then what I started doing was they weren't really coming out I started really sharing my frustrations like I'm like you know what I had this situation at work that was really tough I've got this coworker I've got this boss and they saw me just unload stuff and then all of a sudden my boys are like I got a teacher just like that or I got a coach just like that so one really powerful thing is the more you can express your emotions your kids find out that okay you're not this dogmatic top-down dad just telling you okay watch this TED talk do this you've got your own issues that you're struggling with and now there's so much more comfortable sort of open up and from an early age I've actually seeked out the advice of my kids and I'm like what do you think I should do in the situation I've got this challenge coming up what should you do and you get some really insightful advice but it also makes them feel like this is a company and we're equal so a lot of parents that struggle with their kids that company's saying my kids don't listen I'm like do you like working in a company where your manager tells you what to do 24/7 would you like to work in that company and they're like hell no I'm like well that's how your kid feels because day and night you're telling them don't do this do this give them some ownership tell them that how can they participate in these decisions and how can they help you as well - and it's just much more empowering and it's an undercover way you don't have to have these forced rituals like you said where you're going to I rose from teenagers but you can sort of do this throughout the day do you have a point of view on phones and the age at which that starts to become less harmful like to be clear I wish I didn't have a phone I'm convinced that it is although it comes with tremendous benefit and obviously I can't imagine not having one or I wouldn't at this point but I think it's a very harmful thing that I bring with me and my view is I want to delay my kids having that as long as possible do you have a view on that so I don't have a hard number for it but

[01:49:20] I look at the phone as literally being a drug or a toxin and you have to see that basically if your kid is a type that is really consuming a lot of media and other forms I'm not going to give him a pack of cigarettes this is just something you need to delay as much as you can luckily and honestly this is not I mean we sort of got lucky because we sort of didn't expose him too much meeti early on we focused more on hobbies and playing things like that so they don't really get much stimulation from digital devices so but we did eventually end up sort of giving in to it around middle school around 7 or 8th grade because what we realized is a lot of their kids are talking about stuff and unfortunately the school they were at at an open phone policy so many of them are looking at stuff and they're socializing using their phone and we didn't want our kids to be standing sort of isolated not be sort of part of that so we had a very long discussion about what the phones for and we sort of introduced at that point and at least there's a lot of stuff that's probably going on Peter I don't know about but but I feel like when they're doing homework their phones on the charger they're not using it at all but for some of their friends I mean a little we carpool with some of them and they cannot keep their fingers off the device if that was my kid I'll either take the phone away or implement some more harsh restrictions on that so

[01:50:24] I think you have to customise it rather than go by okay by this aid you should introduce it so if you're providing advice to some of your patients what does that spectrum look like of because I'm guessing that given how thoughtful you are about all these things your patients are just as interested in your views on parenting as they are on hyperinsulinemia yeah so if I do seminars and talks on this I'm very hard-nosed about this

[01:50:43] Peter I think we're living in a world right now where we're just sort of we've kind of normalized this whole thing it's kind of like back in the days I think you've talked about this where we knew cigarettes were bad for us but hell people were smoking any my dad was a pulmonologist who smoked I remember going to lung cancer conferences were in the hallway pulmonologist for smoking cigarettes after looking at slides of lung cancer biopsies I mean that's how was this is just a few decades ago and I feel like we're living in an era right now where people just casual is like but yeah my kid was on this social media platform till 2:00 in the morning they just kind of joke about oh yeah he's hooked on the device but it's scary what it's doing I mean we definitely when I really dig down in these family sessions they always identify the phone as being a major cause of just conflict in the family attention-deficit stuff so many issues so I laid out I'll show them then your chemistry I'll show them the dopamine pathways the fact that what's happening in social comparison you talked to dr. Percival skee about this and and the impact of what's happening there when you talk to these kids especially girls in particular the social comparison that happens at that level is just amplified to a different level altogether in terms of subtle messaging like oh yeah we showed up at this party but all of a sudden you're not included in that it's really a difficult line we're treading right now so the parents need to be aware of that and we need to sort of set some boundaries and and when parents give me pushback and they're like you know what

[01:51:57] I have no control of it I tell them well let's say your kids sitting at home and they decide to light up a cigarette are you just gonna sit there and they're like no of course not I'm like well you have to look at this as being pretty analogous to that because because of this device they're going to bed late they're having social issues this is something we need to take seriously so you've got to kind of reframe it cuz like I said the normalization of this digital media use has made it something that people are not taking seriously enough and I was actually in the process of starting a not-for-profit called data doctors against tech addiction like I wanted to get CEOs and entrepreneurs from high-tech companies physicians it's on my to-do list but it's something my wife and I are totally passionate about it feel like we need to expose this more manbo I hope at least one person listening to this can bring something to help you guys on that yeah I'd love to make it easy for people to reach out to you but going back to this point because again I'm obviously very personally interested in it but I just know from because our kids aren't there yet but I have so many patients whose kids are there how much of this is a substitution effect versus a regulation of the thing let me give you an example if you have someone who's smoking there's the regulatory environment around making it harder to smoke like we're gonna charge more money we're gonna place restrictions on where you can smoke but the other side of that is what's the root cause of why you're smoking oh there's a bit of anxiety well look why don't we give you something else to do that's scratching the itch of that so I don't know if that's the right analogy but when you think about the quick hits that we get from social media the sort of I don't know I mean I think there's more reasons than I can count as to why we find these things so addictive if you're dealing with your kids and let's say your kids were really struggling to put that phone away how much of it would come down to just restriction versus bringing other things into bear I think the latter point you're right once you develop a confrontational relationship with that kid then obviously them using the phone as a way for them to rebel they're gonna want to consume that media even more so

[01:53:50] I think these are the areas where if you've got a bit of a combative relationship with your child already this is where you've got to introduce and add things so this is obviously if they're idle time is focused on a media device what are the things can they do with their idle time like what are the other hobbies what are the other things we can instill and I'm not saying that you're gonna cut out the phone completely but this might be a sign that all of us in the house need to sort of address this and as you know a lot of these kids have got parents that can't get off their phones either and we say that oh it's for work all the time but it's rarely ever anything life-threatening a lot of us have to sort of model that I've had some parents come to see me and I've told them you know what just don't even limit their time but for 10 or 15 minutes can you guys do this sort of activity can you go for a walk and do a hike and just kind of naturally compress the time they're on the digital media device because you've introduced other types of activities because then at least their brains not being exposed to the media as much and they're finding that wow there are certain things that we're doing that are actually enjoyable that don't involve a device just a weekend to go camping sometimes when you get their friends together we tell our friends usually when we gather let's have a rule already that no devices during the next 12 hours when we're out at this camp and it's good to find this is the other thing people find is if you've got some friends in your circle that sort of agree with that approach it makes it much easier because then you can have dinners you have friends come over you're like guys let's just have the kids not bring their phones or put in a basket and let them just play outside does everybody agree and usually people will there might be a couple they're like okay why you know it's their own life but but you want to surround yourself in with more and more of those types of people I can't think of a better way to end this podcast then on that note Ron this has been really interesting I think we've talked about this before but your experience is disproportionately with a group of people who are under a lot of stress who have a genetic predisposition that doesn't enable them to at a metabolic level tolerate the insults that maybe others do but that gives you a window into what we would call a model system in biology that I think the applications of which are much broader I think the work that you're doing in the way that you're communicating and sharing it is just an incredible value it's a resource to me personally Incan and therefore by extension my patients but I think given that I'm kind of a nobody with a very small practice I think more broadly that's a huge application and in fact to people who can take care of themselves the reality of it is so much of what you do and what I do you don't really need a doctor to do for you a person who there are now resources out there whether it be podcast books that allow a person enough information to work on their sleep to work on their management of their own distress their nutrition and these other things that in some ways people like you and I are more there for accountability and then some of the nuanced stuff around the diagnosis and maybe ordering the interventions a little bit but but actually I wanted highlight I think you bring up a key point because I have a lot of patients to see me who are engineers then they often tell me I wish I went to medical school because I could do what you could do and then I kind of remind them you know the burnout rates of Medicine about 50% so it's like it's not that going to medicine with a solve this problem but you can still make a huge impact on the lives of your co-workers your family just with the knowledge you've gained and that's been one of the most rewarding thing I think you know from your audience to the many individuals have gone out and they've made an impact on their community they've become sort of the evangelists for health and you don't need an MD a

[01:56:59] PhD for that you can do that and that to me as much as I do all these activities I get no more gratification the most gratification is if I have a one-on-one interaction with the human being and I can make an impact on their life and you don't need special fancy degrees anybody at any stage can do that so so I'm glad you call that out you really don't need to have advanced degrees to have this sort of meaningful interaction well thanks so much Ron I really appreciate it and again look forward to it where can people find you it's the easiest place for people to find you'd you'd spend much time on social media that we've just talked about is it easier for them to look at your books you have a blog so the best ways through the blog and just click on the email icon and I answer all my emails and a blog just put my name Ronny Sinha dot-com ro NES hsn.com and we'll link to all of its - awesome it's been an honor to be here with you Peter thanks so much for all the work you thank you for you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Tia MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc unsocial you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
