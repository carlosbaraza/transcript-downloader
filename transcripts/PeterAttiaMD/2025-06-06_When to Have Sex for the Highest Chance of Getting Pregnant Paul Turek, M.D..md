This clip is from episode 351 ‒ Male fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility, and navigating testosterone replacement therapy | Paul Turek, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Daily Ejaculation Can Lower Sperm Quality – Most men benefit from 24–48 hours between ejaculations when trying to conceive
- Abstinence Timing Affects Semen Analysis – Sperm count increases with abstinence, but motility drops after a few days, making 2–4 days ideal for testing
- Sex Early in the Fertile Window Boosts Pregnancy Rates – A study of 700+ couples showed the highest success when intercourse was frontloaded 5–6 days before ovulation
- Sperm Can Survive for Days in the Reproductive Tract – Some sperm bind to the fallopian tubes and remain viable, ready to fertilize the egg when it’s released
- Egg Lifespan Is Short—Sperm Needs to Be There First – With the egg viable for only about 8 hours post-ovulation, earlier sex improves the chances of conception

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this clip from The Drive podcast with Dr. Paul Turek:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment focuses on optimal timing and frequency of sexual intercourse for conception. Dr. Turek discusses the biological timing of sperm production, survival, and optimal intervals for conception. Key insights include the importance of "frontloading" intercourse before ovulation and the significant difference between optimal timing for semen analysis versus conception.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Sperm production takes approximately 74 days on average [00:07:10]
- Egg survival after ovulation is only about 8 hours [00:05:17]
- 80% of natural conceptions occur when sex is frontloaded before ovulation [00:05:45]
- For semen analysis: 2-4 days of abstinence is optimal [00:02:12]
- For conception: every other day intercourse is recommended [00:00:00]
- Sperm can survive multiple days in the fallopian tubes by binding to the endothelium [00:04:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Have intercourse every other day when trying to conceive [00:00:00]
- Start having intercourse 5-6 days before expected ovulation [00:02:39]
- Don't wait until ovulation to have intercourse - frontload instead [00:02:39]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- For semen analysis: abstain 2-4 days before sample collection [00:02:12]
- When treating male fertility issues, expect changes to take 2.5-3 months minimum [00:07:10]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Semen analysis requires 2-4 days of abstinence for optimal results [00:02:12]
- Sperm count rises with longer abstinence but motility decreases [00:02:12]

5. **References & Resources**:
- New England Journal paper studying 700 couples' conception timing [00:02:39]
- Science paper from 1960s using tritiated water to study spermatogenesis [00:06:20]
- Berkeley study using deuterated water to track sperm production [00:06:20]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"80% of conceptions naturally or at home occur when sex is frontloaded as opposed to reacting to ovulation." [00:05:45]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What factors influence individual variation in sperm production time?
- How do environmental factors affect sperm survival in the female reproductive tract?
- What is the exact mechanism of sperm binding and survival in the fallopian tubes?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Is there a frequency of ejaculation that is too much that if if a guy is say ejaculating every single day, is that insufficient to get a complete replenishment where if he's having infertility, you would say you got to move it to every other day or whatever the number is. So that's a a great extrapolation of the pot of the pot of soup idea. And so on that note, I would say typically we recommend every two days of two days of abstinence between sex every other day is to optimize right but not for the seam analysis. That's for conception. Okay? Because depends how old you are in your biology. But most men need a day or two to refill to to recharge completely a day or two. So that's that's why we do that. That's why we recommend that. That's sort of a generalization. And some men are fine every day. Okay. I had a guy uh once who had to bank sperm for hepatitis treatment and he was looked like Mickey

[00:00:56] Ror and he had a wooden leg and he's about 50. And I said, "You're going to need to abstain for a couple couple three days to do this seam analysis so we get a good sample. I want it to be, you know, optimized one." He looked at his partner and he goes and she looked at me. She goes, he grabs he she grabs him and says, "He can't do that. He's every day. He can't do that. I don't know what he's going to do." So he's like he was panicking that he had to hold off for day. I was like I was like

[00:01:21] I said how often do you have sex? He said twice a day every day. I'm like okay. So that was uh that was great. Then I had one man wonderful orthopedic surgeon at Stanford and I asked him on my questionire said how often do you have sex and he wrote 0.00001356 which he divided once a year. Well 0 weekly 00015 like you know

[00:01:43] Avagadro's number right. And I'm like, which meant he was so frustrated that was a beautiful way to say that was the 0001355. Yeah. So anyway, the um Yeah. So that's so there for a semen analysis for diagnostics for infertility when you when you abstain longer your sperm count will rise but your motility will fall because it's older.

[00:02:12] So there's a you know there's a minmax curve that you're optimizing for which you would say is three days would be about right when you're not going to gain that much you're not going to lose that much motility after that it starts going so there's sort of biological variability which we try to minimize when we do the seam analysis so 2 to 4 days of abstinence that's a different period than what we're recommending for sex which is every other day and that's based on a New England

[00:02:39] Journal paper where you looked at they looked at um I think 700 couples and they had them keep diaries. I think it was a Boston based paper, keep diaries of how they uh had sex, when they ovulated, and when they got pregnant. And then they said, "Do what you normally do and then give us the diaries." And then they evaluated them and they found that having sex, say ovulation is day 15 of the cycle, um when they started having sex on 9, 11, 13, there were significant pregnancy rates and that every other day was the optimal interval. But even 5 days before and 3 days before, there were substantial pregnancy rates before ovulation. But if you waited to ovulation and then had sex, that's about 20% of conception. So when you get the kit, don't react to it. Predict in front of it. So frontload the sex. Very important point. And why is that? Is that because there's a reservoir effect in this uterus. It's managed. Sperm will survive for a day or two. So when men are under stress, if ovulation is day 15, how could a day 11 sperm survive 4 days? Does it's nurtured once it's past the vagina, but how many of them are surviving? Is it literally the lone wolf or is it the last hundred? Maybe some of the sperm bind to the avi and wait where is remind me where the avduct is.

[00:04:00] So the uterus and there's the fallopian tubes fallopian tubes and that's the the avduct. a duct is right below where they tube essentially. Yeah, they they bind to the endothelium and just park if there's no egg. They'll just sit there and they'll So again, going back to our moon analogy, this is after you've done stage one, stage two, stage three, you're now out of gravity, right?

[00:04:21] Like it's actually not an energetics problem anymore. You're not fight death star problem, right? That's right. You've escaped the hostile environment in this case of gravity. So now it's a fun place. It's the right pH. It's warm. So So, do we have a sense, this would be a very interesting experiment of um what is the longest duration that a sperm could survive for conception? In other words, you to do the experiment, let's just make it as a thought experiment. you had, you know, a large number of women that you knew were going to ovulate on day 15 and then you would have them, you know, have intercourse on day seven, 8, 9, 10, and you create a histoplot or a distribution of what's the frequency of pregnancy across those things and kind of ask like what's the bottom fifth percentile, which is the theoretical possibility. That's a good one. And then the same thing after, right? You want to develop the bell curve of the whole

[00:05:17] Well, we know that once the egg is ovulated about 8 hours and then it's over. Oh, this is a very important point. It really needs to be front. If it's only 8 hours of survival, this is after ovulation about 8 hours it's dead. If it's not, this is a very very left tail curve. Correct. Ah, I did not know that. Okay. So, you want the sperm there ahead of time. So, 80% of conceptions naturally or at home occur when sex is frontloaded as opposed to reacting to ovulation.

[00:05:45] And most of the apps that are available nowadays will tell you that. Peter, you're drawing a graph. I am. I I I have to draw. And it looks like it's algebraic. This is incredible. Okay. Yeah. Just this is it's easier for me to think about these things graphically. Um and and to think that it basically shuts off at about 8 hours. So I give some some more physiology. I um there was a study that showed how long it took to make a sperm. And it was published in science I think in the 60s. And they gave men uh treatiated water. They gave men Yeah.

[00:06:20] They gave men radioactive hydrogen. Treatiated water. Yeah. And then they biopsy their testicles, which could never be done nowadays. But I did a little different. I gave duterrated water with a with a a group at Berkeley and we gave healthy men uh durated water for a week and and then we checked the first sorry dumb question. Why didn't they just measure the ejaculate? Why did they have to biopsy this the intestines? Why did they just want to know about spermatogenesis?

[00:06:51] But we didn't want they actually wanted to torture the guys but and they weren't I don't know what that that's wild but that was the best data and we did deuterated water which is not radioactive and we could measure that. So we gave them a dose and then we watched their ejaculates weekly. Yep. And we looked for when duterated the hydrogen showed up in the in the in the

[00:07:10] DNA and it was an average of 74 days. So normally say three months to make a sperm. So some women were 42 days and that's making that's going through the epidmus and getting ejaculated. So that's a you know some so we talked about maybe two months in the testice and two weeks a week or two in the epidmus and then maybe a couple of weeks to ejaculate and this was all the average 74 days. So it actually changed the timeline enormously to a much faster one that uh so 74 days. So when you do anything to a man fertility wise, you you're not going to expect to see anything change for at least 2 and 1/2 months. And when you talk about full replacement of that seammen, it's probably it's probably in the B90 days when it's all replaced. The pot is replaced. Yep. So that that's a limitation of what we do cuz 42-y old women want now and we have 3 to 6 months. When I did a study on fixing varicus seals, which is an infertility problem in men, it's surgery. And I looked at the meanantime to conception.

[00:08:13] It was about 7 months after repair, which is two cycles of sperm production. I'm Peter Aia.
