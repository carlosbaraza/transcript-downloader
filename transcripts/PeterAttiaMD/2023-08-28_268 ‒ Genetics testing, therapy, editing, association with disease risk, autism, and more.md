Wendy Chung is a board-certified clinical and molecular geneticist with more than 25 years of experience in human genetic disease research. In this episode, Wendy delves deep into the world of genetics by first exploring the historical landscape of genetics prior to decoding the human genome, contrasting it with what we know today thanks to whole genome and exome sequencing. She provides an overview of genetic testing by differentiating between various genetic tests such as direct-to-consumer, clinical, whole genome sequencing, and more. Additionally, Wendy unravels the genetic underpinnings of conditions such as PKU, breast cancer, obesity, autism, and cardiovascular disease. Finally, Wendy goes in depth on the current state and exciting potential of gene therapy while also contemplating the economic implications and ethical nature of gene editing.

[00:00:00] there's a big difference and not all genetic testing is the same um and I'm not being critical of any of the companies or that do this but just to realize they're trying to serve a different purpose so 23 and me as an example um or ancestry.com uh as another example those are more things that are not medically sort of targeted they're not trying to answer a specific medical question of do you have an increased risk of breast cancer do you have an increased risk of heart attack they're really not getting at that level of detail hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:38] AA hey Wendy thanks for making time to uh to chat today this is an especially busy day as I learned you're literally in the process of moving from New York to Boston later today no less so um we'll try not to uh to get in the way of that transition but that's probably a good intro to kind of explain what it is you do your moving from um one prestigious institution in uh New York to another in Boston tell us where you're going sure I'm going to be the chair of pediatrics at Boston Children's

[00:01:10] Hospital and will be at Harvard Medical School you're both an MD and a PhD uh how do you balance your time between I guess let's not include the new responsibilities that will be administrative but up until now how have you balanced your time between uh the lab and clinical practice how do those split so they split about 20% clinical 80% research but truth be told they're really together um so when I think about things I always say it starts with a patient and ends with a patient so it starts with a patient to me in terms of clinically seething them um many times the answers aren't obvious and so it becomes a research question and uh at the end of the day though it has to go back to the patient So within this that split I think just signifies how much we have to learn and and why we why research is so important to improv clinical care now did you you didn't do a combined mstp or mdphd program you did your PhD first and then went to medical school or were did you do the combined program yeah I did a combined program between Cornell and Rockefeller and since Rockefeller doesn't have a medical school we do that with Cornell I see and um so so presumably you knew you wanted to be a physician scientist as you went through training yes that's right what what Drew you to your current field of genetics and how would you describe to somebody what it is you do in the lab

[00:02:32] I'll give you the short version of this but I was fortunate enough early in my career to be exposed to the National Institutes of Health and was able to spend as an undergraduate uh Summers there and that was really when I I was a biochemistry major as an undergrad but had the ability to work on fenel ke Nua and um although it was mostly in the laboratory was able to spend time at NIH at the hospital and seeing patients and realize this whole Paradigm which to this day is really how I do things about thinking about about how these pieces fit together and I couldn't really think about the science without thinking about the patients and I couldn't move forward and fill the gaps in our knowledge for patients unless I did the science um I happened to I think be good at both and so it was a natural to me to do both and

[00:03:14] I was young and not so worried about the number of gray hairs that I would have by the time I finished and so uh sat out on this uh relatively Long training path but one that suited me extremely well let's talk a little bit about PKU it's maybe a good introduction to a uh genetic disease so um maybe tell folks what it is and how frequently it occurs yeah great question uh so fenel PKU stands for fennel ke Nua uh we may come back to it a little later in the show but um it was actually how we started newborn screening um it was to me a paradigm in terms of um patients and families really working together to improve care and being very much

[00:03:54] Partners in that and so that was even true for a condition that I started studying uh as a biochemistry I was interested specifically in the um biochemistry of that but I realized and this was in the late 80s that a lot of what I was do was doing genetic sequencing to understand the genetic basis of this um what we call melan or or single Gene condition um in this particular case we did know the gene for this condition but there were so many other things that I were seeing that we didn't yet know the genes for these underlying conditions and it was coincidental but really just I I would say for two it is for for me that the year I started my mdphd program was the year the Human Genome Project was announced in terms of going forward and

[00:04:37] I had um I think the I don't know maybe foresight or good luck to be able to see that it was going to be a brand new future when we would have that entire Encyclopedia of information to be able to think about human disease differently and thinking about opportunities in the future and one what could one what one could do with the information when we had it and so I really planned my career and thinking about what I'd be able to do 10 or 20 years after I started and that ended up proving well um and so

[00:05:07] I've spent a lot of my time using that information and and trying to apply it to health so what's the clinical manifestation of PKU y so fenal Ken ARA is a um Bittersweet condition in the sense that uh it can be associated with intellectual disabilities if not treated but if caught early and um if treated with a diet that is restricted in fenol in one of the amino acids that we see in proteins if we restrict that then even though individuals with PKU can't digest that and get rid of the toxic byproducts we can prevent those toxic byproducts from building up in the body and essentially poisoning the brain um I say tragic because and again we may get to it I've identified individuals who weren't picked up through newborn screening and picked up through some of my research days for instance as teenagers and had irreversible intellectual disabilities but yet we can prevent those types of problems if these children are identified as newborns and so that's what our whole newborn screening program was originally predicated on is that early diagnosis early intervention changing lives improving lives um and in fact uh we do that extremely well for most individuals with

[00:06:16] PKU is PKU um a dominant gene and is it fully penetrant or is there any variability in that that's a great question so it's a recessive condition meaning it takes two to tango both your parents are care for that condition um within this there is a spectrum um so we have individuals that are what we call hyper fenal Alan anemic so they don't technically have PKU they're not symptomatic they wouldn't have problems with intellectual disabilities but it's a spectrum of severity so uh Beyond a certain threshold you have too much of the toxic buildup and that's when you end up with the problems in terms of brain function but there are some individuals who have what I'll call subclinical phenotypes that is I could see it if I measure if I bothered to measure the amenal menol alanine in their blood but they have enough of the enzyme to be able to clear the toxic byproduct so um that becomes one of the tricky things for us to do in screening newborns is to decide where that threshold is to to adjudicate this and figure out who needs treatment so is the screening that's done on newborns a genetic screen where you're looking for two copies of the gene that's a great question um the traditional way we do this in the very old days believe it or not was based on on um looking at bacteria and how they would grow on an augur uh that was depleted in phenyalanine and we would take a heel prick from a baby and put a little dried blood spot um punch of that dried blood spot onto a bacterial lawn and see again where the bacteria would grow so in the very old days in the late 60s early 70s we did the screen in that way um we got more sophisticated and had ways of being able to directly measure phenol alanine and we now do it with a process called t of mass spectrometry but we still use that Dy blood spot to be able to do it um interestingly enough uh with a program that we've recently started called cardan we also have an orthogonal way of being able to screen which is based on looking at the DNA um so that we've got two different essentially data streams coming in to help us with the adjudication of what I was describing before who really needs treatments where's that threshold and being able to be better in terms of our test parameters both sensitivity and specificity so that we can really identify with greater certainty the babies who need treatment that's interesting so just to make sure I understand the reason you don't just rely on say a genome sequence at the moment even though you know what Gene to look for it would be targeted you wouldn't need to do a whole genome sequence is because that wouldn't tell you about the phenotype fully and the phenotype is just as important as the genotype may be more important as you make a clinical decision about dietary restriction so it's very insightful and

[00:09:00] I'm going to repeat it back just because it might be a subtle thing for some uh people so reading out the DNA sequence we're good at we're not perfect at and so being able to decide based on your DNA sequence alone for phenyalanine hydroxy the relevant Gene we're not able to perfectly make that onetoone correlation about whether or not you'll be Beyond a threshold of disease in terms of phenyalanine levels so we do need in this case I'll call the phenotype the level of phenyalanine levels in the blood we do need to have that phenotype before we get to the phenotype of intellectual disabilities which is what we're trying to prevent so you're right that in this case we use two different data streams to come in um the other reason why the phenotype alone is imperfect is you can imagine depending on what you've eaten your phenyalanine levels fluctuate during the course of the day and so we do it as a crosssectional one time and you might happen to get a baby at just the wrong time or just a you know sort of higher level and so being able to have both of those data streams come in allow us to be even better in terms of the accuracy now what's interesting um if you if you look at a can of soda or anything that has aspartame in it it always presents this warning and says you know if you have PKU beware I always find that kind of interesting because the absolute amount of phenyalanine in a minuscule amount of aspartame which is found in a Diet Coke or something seems really small is that clinically significant and if so wouldn't that suggest that even milligrams of this amino acid could be problematic to those

[00:10:37] Afflicted so for those Afflicted they have to be really careful so if you actually have PKU then we have a very special diet for you you're not taking diet sodas you're not doing anything with aspartame in fact we may have you on what's effectively a pretty not so fun diet to be on um and in fact um many people don't want to be on that diet for life because it's not the tasty diet but for women in particular when they become pregnant it becomes not only their own body they're influencing but that of the fetus developing inside and so we have to be quite careful with women with PKU when they're pregnant as well and because of that um from a labeling point of view we want to make sure they're aware of what's in different food products that they might be eating because they won't feel the effect right away it's not as if they get a headache or something like that and we don't want to see the effects on the developing fetus later on you know given that amino acids are sort of show up in all sorts of places I mean and and it's not just like well I'm eating eggs so therefore I'm just eating methionine I mean are there actual protein sources that are completely void of phenyalanine I mean there must be if you're able to subside on on some sort of phenyalanine uh free diet what what what types of foods are excluded completely from this diet so uh we don't exclude 100% fenol so it's a low protein diet in general um so we still need some protein and you still have some essential amino acids for your body to be able to grow you need to make Muscle especially as a developing child there's a lot of growth that's there so we don't completely restrict um and it's actually a titration if you want to think of it that way that is that we make dietary interventions and we check and then we go back and we didd and we go back and forth to be able to get it just right so it's a lifelong treatment in that way and it becomes even more critical for young children as both their brain is developing their body is developing uh we have to get it just right so um not trivial to do but on the other hand when we're when we're good about it um children grow up very healthy but it is lifelong treatment in other words just getting through adolescence is not enough if you um you know come off the diet later in life will you still suffer cognitive changes or are you most sensitive to those during development and by development I mean sort of adolesence and childhood yeah you're most sensitive during childhood U for sure when the brain is growing and when you're making those synapses and connections and being able to develop those um all of the things you're learning to do you're definitely most sensitive then um I find that some people adults in particular will tell me about differences that they have in terms of clarity of their thinking and other things if they're you know just totally off the diet and not not restricted whatsoever um but it is different in the sense that you don't crash and burn instantaneously um it's more subtle in terms of what what you feel how your body feels you know there are certain disease we'll probably talk about them like CLE cell anemia where um they're recessive conditions but having one copy of the Gene and therefore not having the full phenotype poses an advantage and that's at least in some part explains the propagation of the gene is there any such analogy to be made here are there benefits in having one copy of this Gene uh and obviously there are huge detriment to having two copies so not that we know of I will say that I don't think that we know everything but it's not so obvious in terms of the frequency of these mutations um there are I think historical reasons why we see it more in certain parts of the world versus others um but uh as far as we know no selective advantage and is there an ethnic distribution there are so we do tend to see this for instance more in for instance Ireland it tends to be more frequent than we see in other parts of the world subsaharan Africa as an example and you know that has to do with historical reasons in part and where variants occurred U migration patterns of how people's migrated around the world um but we do see it really for all all four corners of the world PKU is seing everywhere and in fact in newborn screening uh pretty universally screened throughout the world for places that have newborn screening programs uh and just to paint the uh you know Contours of it in in Ireland what's the Frequency that a child is born with this it's a good question I I'm going to Hazard a guess although I'd have to say I'd need to fact check myself we're probably in the order of one in 5,000 or so okay and in the US less than that but bit less than that maybe one in 10,000 okay so still pretty common condition relatively speaking yep I suspect we're going to talk about this in much greater detail as we go on but before we do I'll want to build up a foundation so people understand the basics but but just before we leave PKU is this something that you think in your career will be a target of gene therapy it's a great question and I have to say something I think a lot about um I think we have yet to see certainly many inborn errors of metabolism so things that are conditions like fenel Keon Nua but other things that have to do with the way the body digest processes metabolize Foods uh are some would say easier targets for gene therapy and we can go into more or less detail about this but in part many of these genes are expressed in the liver so the liver is kind of the if you want to think about it the metabolic brain of the body or the metabolic

[00:15:56] Clearing House the brain or rather the liver is a relatively easy place to Target in terms of gene therapy there are ways that the liver is clearing things and some of the vectors and The Delivery Systems we use are relatively easy to get to the liver and for certain conditions where these are recessive conditions with loss of function you have to add back the missing enzyme or protein but you probably don't have to get to 100% And just for some of your listeners will be astute um you had alluded to carriers for these conditions recessive individuals who have one copy of the gene that's working just fine but one copy of the gene that's not they tend to be fine that was the point essentially of what you were saying do carriers have any advantage or disadvantage and and basically they're they're indistinguishable is what I would say which means for us in terms of a gene therapy or Gene addition or Gene replacement strategy you don't have to be perfect you have to get some in there you have to get enough in there but you don't have to get 100% And so for all those reasons um these types of conditions are interesting in terms of gene therapy targets and as you alluded to given that the treatments is lifelong that kind of stinks and so for something that could be transformational in terms of quality of life many of these metabolic disorders certainly are interesting in terms of genetic therapy so um we may come back to it but I will not be surprised if within our lifetimes uh people will be trying gen genetic therapies for PKU well I I definitely want to come back to this both from a historical concept uh context and then also to talk about the future but before we do it might make sense now to pause and kind of go back to some of the basics I I know that our listeners are quite sophisticated in general but I always think it helps to just put some foundational knowledge in place so um you talked about how you began your PhD

[00:17:49] I'm just doing the math but it sounds like you began your PhD in the early 90s and um this was about a decade before the human genome was sequenced so at that time you know obviously we understood the structure of DNA uh we understood that it was uh a double helix we understood uh that DNA was a template that was used to make RNA and that RNA was then used to make protein and that's you know essentially the axiomatic uh principle of Life although there maybe we can talk about um some edge cases there um how back in that era like how did did you do genetic work uh maybe explain the differences between sequencing protein gels and what the state of science was a decade before the human genome was sequenced and also if you if you can remember speculate on what was believed to be the outcome of the human genome sequence and how that differed from what was actually found so

[00:18:50] I'll give you a couple examples um that'll bring a smile to some graduate students face out there somewhere um so when I first started my PhD um eventually PCR which people know about polymerized chain reaction is a molecular Xerox machine that we use to amplify DNA and use it for sequencing and other things we uh relatively soon after I started graduate school had automated thermocyclers but within PCR one had to change the temperature for different stages of this amplification process we had some where you'd have to denature the DNA so you'd heat things up others where the enzyme the polymerase would work at a different temperature so you'd have to bring the temperature down um and so there were three different temperatures that You' cycle at in the very early days we didn't have machines that would cycle between these three different temperatures or go through 30 uh different cycles of this so you can imagine uh the cheapest labor is a graduate student so you'd have an ice bucket you'd have a heating block and you'd have a you know sort of a a bath a water bath in terms of a different temperature with a timer in which you'd be literally moving samples and you'd be essentially a robot being able to do this uh in the early days and we'd work with radioactivity to do the DNA sequencing we'd have these gels where we' be reading out these ladders of sequence it was all very manual and not very high throughput um and certainly I did that as I said reading out the phenol alanine hydroxy a gene to be able to see all of this and those were the early days but if you think about scale and what was necessary to do this for three billion base pairs there was no way that that could be scaled and so whole Industries evolved in terms of being able to do this uh in a more automated uh way to be able to do this and and really the World organized itself around ways to do this massive project um in the early days we had different chromosomes that were designed to different areas so Columbia used to be the chromosome 13 center of the universe in terms of being in charge of that and uh that meant that uh chromosomes are ordered by largest uh with the smallest number so chromosome one is the largest chromosome so you'd have some groups that had bigger jobs than others but we would spread these around and uh different groups would come together from around the world for chromosome 13 meeting for instance and try and compare notes we would have things that we called yeast artificial chromosomes in which we' literally under a microscope dissect out these chromosomes and put these into these constructs so that we could make more of the DNA and be able to go through and sequence these um but it there there have been transformational technologies that have allowed us to go through in terms of higher throughput greater processivity um but one of the things that the Human Genome Project did that I think was really important was um in the early days data sharing data access um really being able to make the world Come

[00:21:33] Together by allowing um large groups of people to work together it wasn't every person for themselves it really was a scientific Enterprise uh collectively and that's I think a fundamental principle in which many of us as genomicists believe very firmly in in terms of data sharing privacy and protecting individuals individual patients individual participants uh but yet being able to make data freely available as immediately as we can so that we can all use it and get smarter together and learn from each other and be able to um Advance science as quickly as possible I just can't help but want to go back even a little bit further and um

[00:22:12] I remember one of the most interesting books I read oh probably in medical school was the double helix uh which is of course the the the the relatively short but completely fascinating and gripping story of the discovery of the structure of d DNA do you want to just briefly explain because I sort of think right now we are so far removed from how how much Ingenuity was required to figure out that structure and how that laid the foundation for all that came and and refresh my memory But but so so this was what 1953 is that right yeah I think that's about right yeah in that ballpark so up up at that point did we understand that there were 23 pairs of chromosomes we already knew that correct so uh Believe

[00:23:03] It or Not There were arguments in the early days about whether it was 46 or 48 total chromosomes uh in pairs and it was hard to visualize eventually you know we got the counting down we were able to separate them out enough by size and eventually banding pattern but um in the early days even controversy about that okay so what was it that the the four individuals it typically just gives credit to Watson and cck but really there were four people that played a pretty pivotal role in this um what was the Breakthrough that they had that allowed them to understand the structure of this molecule so I won't say that this is my Super Sub specialty um but in terms of the crystallography structure being able to do that get high enough resolution and really have I think the

[00:23:48] Insight in terms of being able to imagine this was uh all of these things coming together quite technical but uh also um as you said I think some unsung heroes in this story as well yeah and and really it was this remarkable ability to look at 2D images that were captured and understand the mathematics and the picture that this had to be a double helix um and it's interesting when you go back and look at some of the other proposed ideas each one of them had a shortcoming each one of them made sense Until you realize nope this wouldn't project in this way or that way so um what was the first human gene that was identified how long after the structure of DNA I'm curious as to what the gene was and and more importantly I guess what were the methods used to identify a gene you know long before we had sequencing so um there were biochemical things that were done so you you mentioned CLE cell disease as an example so we had proteins we knew about proteins protein electropheresis being able to see that um and so conditions like CLE cell disease and he other hemoglobinopathies we knew at the protein level well before we knew at the

[00:25:02] DNA level um so that was something pretty characteristic other cases we knew based on enzymatic activity and so we could see biochemically in a test tube if you will what the reaction that was run so we knew about many of those things before we ever knew the exact DNA sequence or exactly what the genetic variants were that caused those conditions and by the time you were a graduate student so still prehuman genome sequence so right around the time that you know Rudy liel is figuring out what leptin is and things like that um how much resolution did you have into what a gene looked like at at that time so it was pretty painful at the time uh we would use these things called linkage maps to try and figure out what chromosome something a condition was on be able to get closer through linkage analysis to the right neighborhood the right zip code eventually the right address uh when we did this we didn't have great signposts to be able to even figure out where we were within this we didn't have things like structures of genes references um so as you were doing this you were sequencing not just one person with the disease but also you had to sequence uh quote unquote normal people or average people for comparison we didn't have that as something you could just look up online uh we didn't have the internet as an example at the time to be able to see um you know have investigators work together from around the world as what's much more sort of old school passing papers back and forth and you know meeting uh in various locations so it was a lot slower a lot more laborious um and with this I have to say uh and you had mentioned Rudy liel um he he did have this big bold idea in terms of cloning a gene for obesity and it's the first time he put in a grant so putting out that idea you know people thought it was just totally ridiculous the idea that you could we called it positional cloning but identify a gene solely based on its position within the genome um understanding and not requiring any understanding of the biology or physiology but just purely based on genetics and genetic mapping people thought it was impossible to do so and of course uh subsequently you know a whole generation of disease a whole generation of scientists found diseases that way so but you know that it if you can imagine that process was often a decades long process or longer I mean this was not something you did um you know very quickly so I I often tell people you know the first Gene that I cloned took eight years um and you know the last Gene I cloned took hours so you know this is just absolutely astronomically different in terms of how we now find disease genes yeah it's very interesting I I looked at a a graph and um the speed that you're describing even exceeds Mo's law um because of you know it's sort of it's on a Mo's law trajectory with an enormous step function when high throughput sequencing came along which we can probably get to later because I uh I I think it's it's important for folks to understand that what was the first organism uh for which we a whole genome sequence within that it was certainly a microorganism I don't remember if it's E coli or something similar in terms of a bacteria but definitely a very small organism uh yeast were another important part of our library uh and so being able to understand those small organisms certainly much easier um you know even when it comes to the complexity of the human genome some of us would you know say that well it's been announced repeatedly that the Human Genome Project has been finished but it's only been recently even that uh as we say tiir to tiir we've been able to see the sequence really the uh entirety including some of the cryptic portions that are hard to read through so there's still things we have to discover even you know even within the human genome so before the human genome was sequenced which I think was around 2000 the first announcement yes yeah um there was an expectation that humans would have how many genes based on the understanding of how many genes these far far simpler organisms had so there were estimates for some people as many as a 100,000 genes by comparison I think current estimates are about 20,000 genes in terms of the complexity of people humans that is um and but yet the complexity at the individual Gene level is probably more complicated than we appreciated our ability to have different what we call isoforms or versions of the way genes are cut and pasted together or how they're utilized in different ways over time and space by different organs or cell types uh any one gene could be made into a dozen or more different Gene products and so some of that complexity was not at the level of the individual Gene but how that Gene is uh reused in in slightly different ways um and so anyway it was shocking the first time I think we appreciated that it was about 20,000 genes in the genome there were definitely people that were surprised by that yeah it seems like such a small number given the variation between individuals in fact right outside of identical twins we have you know what 8 billion people on this planet all with distinct genomes um and yet the homology the homology between us is how strong like in other words how similar are we all genetically right so we're all 99.9% the same um about one in a thousand base pairs is what you and I probably differ uh by on average so as as humans we're we're we're pretty similar to each other and most of the genetic variant differences that we have are not meaningful um you know they don't cause any differences in terms of the way our bodies function um but uh on the other hands you know as something as settle as one in three billion base pairs uh can be the difference between life and death can be the difference in terms of the way the body or the brain functions so um you know small nucleotide differences profound can be profound depending on what they what genes and when those genes were so basically 3 billion base pairs 20,000 genes 46 chromosomes is s is sort of the is is sort of the the hierarchy of organization um at what point well maybe just explain to folks the difference between coding and non-coding portions of the gene sure um so when you think about all of those a T's G's and C's that you talked about uh it's a relatively small portion of that information that gets moved from the DNA to the eventually the protein so the portions of that that are made into the the proteins are about I don't know let's say for round numbers about a percentage and a half of all of that DNA sequence um that other say 98 and a half% uh there's a lot of it that to be honest we have no idea what it does um there's certain portions we do understand they're very important for regulation to know where and when and how much that Gene is expressed um there may be other things that are subtle in terms of being able to attract binding factors transcription factors other things that may modify the the DNA um biochemical changes to the DNA itself which may affect expression um and there are also what people have called Junk dnas as well in there um repetitive sequences that uh probably don't do anything positive for us U but you know get carried along in the ride um but there's a lot that we also don't know um there we don't know everything clearly about this and there may even be disease-causing variations that are in that space that we haven't even recognized yet so um but the to to your point uh it's a small minority that actually encodes ultimately what we think of as most of um what the what forms the body physically forms the body in terms of proteins and in 2000 when the uh Human Genome Project results were announced what fraction of those 3 billion base pairs were identified Oh So within that um I don't know we'll say round numbers about 70% or so interesting and did that include all of the coding segments or was it not yet understood at that time what fraction of those were coding and non-coding i' say eventually we the majority of the coding was identified at that time uh to answer your question um there were a few portions of the genome that were hard to read out for various reason are hard to map and put the pieces together um one of the things just for the listener to realize is that there was a bit of a jigsaw puzzle uh when we did the when we did and when we do do the sequencing in many cases we're not sequencing I use the term tiir to tiir or end to end along the chromosome so it's not as if we get one continuous strand of the DNA sequence that comes off the sequencers where we can just read through it and know it comes together um in many cases we have pieces of it and we have to informatically put the pieces back together and put it back into the right order in some cases that's because we have overlap between those pieces and so we can see based on overlap this is the first piece that must be the second piece that the third piece based on the overlaps and so we make these things called contigs or contiguous sequences of DNA and put the puzzle and the pieces together in that way um there's certain regions of the genome that are complicated they're they're what we call repetitive sequences and so they may not be unique and it may be hard to even sequence through those regions and so putting those pieces back together in the right order um in some cases has been challenging to do and so sometimes you'll hear some of us as geneticist say there's a dark matter or there's some cryptic regions of the genome that we haven't been able to really dig into and that's because of some of these complexities of the sequences there and our ability to sequence through them so even despite what you're saying in terms of knowing the genes or even knowing portions of the sequences we didn't necessarily know that it was all part of one gene or that we had all the pieces or put it all together yet and so some genes and some diseases were easier to crack than others as a result so today if somebody goes out and gets a commercial uh genetic test what's the difference between someone who goes out and gets a whole genome sequence and say someone that you know goes to one of the over-the-counter uh sequencing services like a 2 and me what's the difference in the analysis and what's the difference in the information this is an important question and if people are listening uh this is time to perk up and listen closely um so there's a big difference and not all genetic testing is the same um and I'm not being critical of any of the companies or that do this but just to realize they're trying to serve a different purpose so 23 and me as an example um or ancestry.com uh as another example those are more things that are not medically sort of targeted they're not trying to answer a specific medical question of do you have an increased risk of breast cancer do you have an increased risk of heart attack they're really not getting at that level of detail uh just as an example ancestry.com is very good at being able to understand your heritage your your literally where your family is from where your ancestors are from it's quite detailed at this point in terms of being able to say what part of the world your family comes from if you might be adopted as an example not know about your hair or your ancestry be able to give you some of that and I'll also say

[00:36:31] For Better or For Worse if you're trying to find this out you may Identify some of your blood relatives um some people who uh you would know from a family reunion and some people you might not know for some reason and people sometimes find out about that uh uh like I said even people who are adopted I've

[00:36:48] I've known to find some of their um actually their birth parents that way so that's one type of thing but that's not really for the intention of identifying information for a medical purpose um and so I just want to warn the listeners that if you get something uh back or more importantly if you don't get something back from those tests it doesn't mean an all clear for your health it doesn't mean that you're free of cancer or won't have any increased risk on the other hand there are other tests that are really designed for a medical purpose to answer a question um and you didn't ask about this specifically but many of the listeners will know that they would have gotten a test for instance if they were thinking about having having children uh plan planning a family wanting to know if they are children or if they were at increased risk of having a child with something like TX disease or cystic fibrosis one of those other recessive conditions uh that we alluded to and so that's not with the attention uh for personal health so much as as I said thinking about future children or families and um let me be clear this is not necessarily about abortion but this is about being able to care for a child long term and think about uh reproductive options so that's another use case and a very common use case in terms of what people will do um another common use case is for thinking about cancer risk and so some people may have a family history of cancer some people may say their particular Heritage is such that uh for instance if they happen to be of Jewish ancestry they may be concerned because they know there's an higher chance of having a brca uh soall breast cancer one or brca 1 or two mutation and so some people do a very targeted test and and

[00:38:26] I'm emphasizing targeted very specific clinical question and again it's answering that question it's not necessarily giving a genetic clean bill of health for everything it's it's very focused on the other hand you alluded to what I'll call a genomic test and and I'm going to make a distinction between genetic and genomic and what I mean by genomic when I'm saying this is It's really including as we talked about all genes so it's not focused on just a handful of genes it's really focused on the genes in the genome those 20,000 genes um you can look at just the coding regions that we talked about before those looking at the protein sequence that we call that in the aggregate an X oh because those little pieces that code the genes are exons e ex o NS and when you put them together in the aggregate we call it the exom other individuals are interested in knowing all three billion of their base pairs their entire genetic sequence and we call that a genome and that will include everything both the coding and the non-coding regions I think of that in terms of genome sequence as being in some ways the th genetic test right it's all encompassing one can blind yourself to look at very focused uh subsets of genes based on a clinical indication or you can look at everything because you want to look at everything about your health or because maybe you don't know all of the genes for your particular symptoms and you have to be all-encompassing in terms of that and we may get to some of those use cases but there are many conditions that are genetically heterogeneous or have many different genes that can cause them and so we want to be all-encompassing in terms of looking at that even though we can sequence all that data right now we can't interpret it all so as an example out of those 20,000 genes we have now assigned functions with disease for about 7,000 but that still means that for over 50% of those genes we don't know of a gene Disease Association and and even I will say because this happens to me with Fair frequency even when I think I know about an association of a gene with a disease if we study it further we'll realize that they don't map just one to one there may be more than one disease associated with a gene and so there's still things that we're figuring out about what those genes do so Wendy let's just talk technically about those different options that you laid out and let's start with the most comprehensive so um I've had a whole genome sequence done and I believe it was done off a couple of tubes of blood maybe even just one tube of blood if I recall but no more than two so 10 CC of blood at the most um what did the so I sent that over to you know it was a university that did it it was part of a clinical trial um what did that

[00:41:16] University do with those two tubes of blood to extract the insight to read the three billion base pairs that uh make up my whole genome yep so I'm guessing uh but but I'm guessing that what they did is um in the white blood cells in that tube of blood they open those up to extract what we call the genomic DNA so the DNA included in each of the nuclei of those white blood cells from that they uh depending on how they did this they uh may have captured out specific fragments and then read through all of that using what we call short read sequencing again my guess in terms of this that short read sequencing was probably less than 100 nucleotides for each little fragment as they did that they then had to do that uh informatic computational step of putting all of those pieces together and in most cases they were probably able to do that because they had a reference sequence they knew what the average person looked like and they put your sequence right on top of that and to the extent that those mapped uniquely they could put that all together there may have been those some of your sequence where they didn't know where it fit and so it got sort of put aside in an area that they didn't even analyze but there were some of your sequence that probably got put aside that they didn't know where it fit how the pieces fit together and in fact the reason I say this and this is very very highly technical is that we're not perfect at doing this and so there are times when there's information over here at the side where we haven't used as they did that they're then able to read out and depending on the purpose of what your analysis was they could read out and they could say well for instance if you are interested I don't know anything about your own medical situation but if they said uh well we're interested in knowing whether or not you have PKU they could look at your phenol alanine Hydrox gene they could read out all the sequence and warn you as I said one in a thousand base pairs there's going to be a difference in this and so they see a difference then they have to do an interpretation and the interpretation is actually um a lot more sophisticated than one might might imagine because again there are literally tens of thousands of genetic variants in your

[00:43:26] Gene genome and what they mean and whether or not they do anything whatsoever is hard to know each of us has M what people think of as mutations or genetic variants that are associated with disease and cause a problem each one of us has those some that are very very powerful some that are kind of wimpy and they infer some very small risk but in the aggregate you put together a lot of these little wimpy genetic variants and it may amount to something more substantial so depending on when your genome was sequenced when it was most recently interpreted you might have gotten really profound powerful information in terms of taking care of yourself or you might have gotten the sort of yeah we don't see much here um you know sort of you go on your Merry way and for the average person my guess is if you were middle-age when this was done for the average middle-aged person it's mostly we don't see much here because you've survived hopefully as a relatively healthy person to this point that you've uh essentially uh made it through some of the most devastating things we can see in the genome one more question before we leave the whole genome sequence and talk about the uh whole exom sequence uh one thing that they learned in me that uh was quite interesting was that I was Mosaic for a certain Gene uh this was only realized because as part of this clinical trial everyone in my family was sequenced and uh one of my children uh had a full copy of the gene which they got from me but I was Mosaic for it so so I didn't have very much of it can you explain what that means yeah so this can come up in a couple of different ways and um I can talk more or less about this if you're interested but um you would think we're the same every cell in our body exactly the same but in fact that's not true and the your viewers or your listeners rather will realize this when we think of cancer uh our genomes are not stable over our life course from the point of conception to the point of death uh and when you think about every cell division if you have to copy over three billion letters we're not perfect and we have spell Checkers to try and catch these things but our body doesn't always catch them and over time mutations can accumulate in the body and of course as they accumulate this may lead to a Barren cell growth which is essentially what cancer is and so cancer is at the heart of a genetic disease but often times not from the genes you're born with but for the changes that happen over your life course now in certain individuals and and I'm guessing this was the case when you just described your family um this will be true not just of your skin cells for instance if there's too much UV damage to your skin in the summertime um but this can happen in your germ line as well so it can happen in the egg and the sperm and when this happens again as what we call somatic mutations or mutations over the life course again if they're in the germ line they can be passed down to the Next Generation and so you can be what we call a germline mosaic you can be a mosaic and Mosaic just like a tile pattern that you see in you know a bathroom or something right where you have some color tiles um one color and some other tiles another color they're a different pattern because some cells have the mutation and some don't and so in the same way you can have what we call gatal mosaics meaning that the germ line is affected in some cases you can see those gatal mosaicism that mosaicism in the blood as well so what you were talking about in terms of getting a blood sample you might see that a certain fraction of the cells have those mutations in the blood and then if you see them in the Next

[00:46:54] Generation as well you'll know that it was transmitted through The Germ wine um I'll share an interesting factoid um for individuals uh the number of those mutations in The Germ line actually increases over the life course and so in particular uh if you think about the biological process for spermatogenesis with men um those sperm continue to divide over the life course and those mutations can continue to accumulate over the life course and so in fact some of the conditions that are associated ated with denovo mutations or new mutations uh we see the frequency of that being greater for parents for instance who are older parents at the time of conception than for parents who are younger at the time of conception and it's not you know that it's like astronomically exponentially higher it's a linear process for those uh those types of mutations but we do see those increasing over the life course historically we would assume that women are more susceptible to that via age I mean it the the rate of either anlo or mutation seems to rise more sharply with women earlier starting probably in mid to late 30s um you pointing out that the same is true of spermatogenesis am I correct in saying that the egg seems more impacted by the sperm and if so why is that is it a more complex division so what you're bringing up is that um meiosis in the two Sexes is different and it is susceptible to different underlying biological processes so you're saying for women um the if you look at the curve in terms of problems anupy or sex Chrome or not sex but rather chromosome differences namely

[00:48:37] Down syndrome is what many people think about increases with Advanced maternal age and that has to do essentially with the stickiness of the chromosomes at meiosis and the ability to separate um or not and so the curve that is associated with that which um many people learned at some point is that um there's an inflection there's it's not a linear relationship with maternal age but uh as you said in the mid-30s it starts to increase more significantly and as a result of that there's a whole um sort of medical way that we can follow women when they're pregnant to try and pick up if they're interested those particular chromosome issues um the difference when it comes to uh what we call DNA sequence differences so again not whole chromos chromosomes but single letters is that that process C of being able to have the cell divide and replicate and copy over that information happens at every single cell division and there's a certain probability that that will happen and so that's a line linear relationship in men and based on the biology men obviously from a reproductive point of view may have uh children over a larger period of time so we can see greater differences across men uh as they're uh reproducing so biology is a little bit different between the two Sexes do we have a clear sense um why you see more of these um myotic differences with age in other words what is the fundamental characteristic of

[00:50:07] Aging that is driving that I uh is it sort of like Evolution says well I don't care because I don't want you to reproduce after a certain age so I'm act you know again not to anthropomorphize Evolution but therefore I'm not going to preserve the Integrity of your genome Beyond a certain age I mean just I'm curious as to see to me that strikes me as the explan like an explanation but not the reason right the reason must be something more fundamental at the level of you know an aging Hallmark process I

[00:50:40] I hadn't thought of the question quite that way but um I do think if you think about throughout all of human history the age at which people were having reproducing and having children um has skewed much younger than it is in terms of current Society so I think we have pushed the boundaries to a certain extent in terms of what the biology historically has been I don't know if we had a you know use use before date uh in terms of ovaries and and and gonads before um but that I think just historically has been what's happened um

[00:51:13] So within that you know the the fundamental biology for women has been proteins that are responsible as I said in terms of meiosis and separating of the chromosomes and being able to have if you remember when meiosis started in females it actually is starting way way early in gestation so even during fetal life and so those proteins have to be working in intact from before a fetus is you know even born before a child is born lasting all the way through whenever that you know pregnancy is conceived essentially when those gametes are finally dividing so that could be you know 30 40 or more years for that process to have to work and that's kind of asking a lot when you think about the biology um for men I'll just throw in another interesting factoid that for some of these mutations that arise during the process of uh G Genesis there are even what we call selfish sperm mutations that is that certain mutations may even give a selective Advantage uh to those spermatocytes where they may have a reproductive division Advantage for instance and so we may see more of those in terms of the biology of what we see in the Next Generation because of the effect they have even in terms of on directly on the sperm so lots of biology at the root of that so let's go one step down from the whole genome sequence to the whole exom sequence so if if if as part of my blood test I only wanted the whole exom sequence are they actually doing the whole genome sequence and just reporting out the exomes or are they actually doing something technically different so to answer the question you have to read the fine print on your genetic test report or your clinical trial consent or or whatever it is um so

[00:52:56] I don't know the answer uh you know without knowing that it certainly was the case that a few years ago not that long ago it was so expensive to sequence a genome that we rarely did it it was really just cost prohibitive the exome was a really good shortcut because we didn't know what a lot of the other information meant anyway so we were kind of it would have been just throwing it away increasingly we have a better sense of what the non-coding regions do uh we have better ability to interpret and recognize genetic Varian and so I would say as the sequencing costs have been coming down there's more of a shift to going to genomes rather than exomes but truly most of what is medically used at this point um is in the coding space so even if you're sequencing a genome it's still focused on the coding regions on a research um basis though very different um and of course we have to do research before we can apply it clinically a lot of the research now is understanding what all of those regions do and being able to eventually use use that information clinically so I do think within the next decade we're going to see a shift and we may even shift from this what we call short read sequencing of these 100 base pair of fragments even to things that are much longer in terms of accuracy able to read through some of the greater the areas that are more complex and probably that we've been missing out on before and a short read you said is about 100 base pairs plus or minus yep so what's the technical limitation for making that longer as you do this there's just lower and lower fidelity for each base pair that you do and so at some point you start getting errors within your readout and you don't want to have too many errors because you can't distinguish between what are true biology versus what are artifacts of what you're doing in the laboratory how are you correcting the errors because if you're getting even one error every in one short read sequence that would I mean given that we're we only differ from each other by one and a half% of those base pairs that that would be you know for example you wouldn't be able to use this information in let's how do we preserve the Fidelity of this to make such bold claims as hey we found this blood at the scene of the crime and we absolutely know dis positively it belongs to this individual we do it not just once is the answer so in fact when we read this out we have a term called rpth it's how many times we look at any one nucleotide in the genome and we don't look at each position just once uh depending on how much we want to spend doing it we might look at the rpth of 30X so we might look at every one position on average 30 times and if you see out of the 30 times 29 of one Al you know one nucleotide one of the other you say oh that one the odd ball there that's probably just a sequencing error that's an artifact of our method in the lab the other 29 are the ones that we want to pay attention to um in some cases and again I bring in cancer it becomes very important to know for those somatic mutations that won't weren't there from birth that they may be there in a small number of cells but cells that can be very very dangerous for cancer and so we may increase the readed depth to be very very high we may go up to a,x in terms of rpth to make sure we've got the accuracy um to see something reproducibly even in 10% of cells but again we're 10% you need 10% of a large number to have the assurance that what you're seeing is in fact representative of the underlying biology not an artifact let's talk a little bit more about an example there so you brought up um braa one and braa 2 so typically the genetic tests that would be done off a whole genome sequence uh or even a targeted sequence because let's say a person says I want specifically to be tested for breast cancer genetics um but you're still testing on the actual DNA taken from white blood cells correct so these days we do things lots of different ways um and just again for some of the listeners we've tried to make everything we do more accessible um this is a fundamental sort of core value for me so as an example we can even now do things from cheek swabs uh from saliva samples from blood samples so again we try and make it less invasive uh easier to do even potentially from home and so for some people who have done something like 23 and me they may have even done it that way let's pick one of those examples a cheek swab or uh a blood test you're and you're going to do this enormous depth of readout to really make sure that there are no copies of the bracket gene or any of the other genes that you're looking at how many genes by the way when we do a a breast cancer genetic screen how many known genes are we looking for so interestingly uh it's a little bit of allart so what I mean by that is it's the your choice it's your choice either as a doctor ordering the test it's your choice is a patient that's getting the test in some cases you know you have a family history of a brca mutation and So within that case we may know the exact address to go to and it's a very simple plus minus readout and we don't have to do a whole genome sequence for that we just need to look at one Gene and say yay or nay it's there or not there for that particular variant um beyond that there even I alluded to this before but there are certain uh variants that are seen in certain communities so as an example if you happen to be ashkanazi Jewish there are three different spots in brca 1 or two that account for the vast majority of all mutations in those two genes and if you know that we can take a shortcut and we can basically say for literally a small fraction of the cost of sequence ing a genome boop boop boop we look at those three spots we get yay or nay and you've got most of the information that you need um to your point uh there's some people who come in with a family history of breast cancer and they say but I want to be careful and so in that circumstance we may do a panel of 50 different genes 50 different genes that'll cover most of the genes that we see for hereditary not just breast cancer but ovarian cancer colon cancer the most common cancers that we see that are driven by germ line or inherited genetic factors so for round numbers 50 is a good number when you're trying to be really comprehensive if you said just give me the focus breast cancer things it might be more like 10 yeah and again you've said this twice now but I think it's it's helpful for folks to listen when last I checked maybe 5% of cancer was accounted for by germline mutations 95% of cancer is accounted for by sematic mutations is that still accurate would you say I'd say I'm going to modify that just a little bit not to be a contrarian um but for the genes that

[00:59:31] I'll call monogenic highly penetrant let me unpack that a little bit monogenic good point monogenic single Gene highly penetrant high probability that over the life course you'll develop cancer if you have this particular Gene genetic variant so when you limit yourself to that yes about 5% of cancers are due to those powerful single genes high probability of cancer now on the other hand over time we've realized that there are additional genes that I'll call moderate risk genes many of those genes

[01:00:02] May confer something like a two to threefold increased risk as opposed to something like a tenfold increased risk so there's another probably 5% or so that are due to those and then there's this other thing that we call polygenic risk poly meaning multiple genic genes polygenic multiple genes and the number of genes we often times look at in those circumstances may be anywhere from a hundred to hundreds or even in some cases thousands of genetic variants all mathematically summed together to understand what the risk is associated with that package all of us have genetic variants that go into that polyenic risk and part of the question is along a distribution are you at the high end of that risk curve or are you at the low end or the average end and So within that um this is now something that is not clinically being utilized routinely but we are on a research point of view trying to understand clinical implementation for now those polyenic risks for cancer and um so so assuming that that amounts to I don't know we'll figure it out but that might amount to 10% of cases you'd say well look 20% of cancer has a genetic component as opposed to and it's broken down into those three categories of you know monogenic highly penetrant uh I think the second category was it monogenic not highly penetrant or not monogenic I'd call it monogenic moderate risk modate penetrant and then polygenic and those would be the three and then going back to this case of say the breast cancer example right so a woman says um I just want to do a deep dive on breast cancer

[01:01:45] I don't know which genes it is because all my family's deceased but you know four women in my family have died of breast cancer we're going to do this cheek swab and you're going to look at 10 genes that are associated plus whatever the polygenic genes are um why is it that you don't need to look directly at breast cells why is it that we can infer that what we see in a cheek cell an indial cell uh or an epithelial cell rather in the cheek or in a monoy in the blood is also captured in uh in mamory tissue good question and the answer is it's probably not um so what you're doing when you're doing the cheek sample the blood sample is you're really getting at The Germ line so you're mostly getting at what you were born with uh what that inherited susceptibility is as we talked about though your genes are changing over your life course your cells are changing over your life course the cancer doesn't happen overnight you don't go from a normal cell to a cancer cell overnight there's a progression in terms of going through this and so uh there are other ways that people have thought about that I'll call it a liid biopsy so this idea that you might be able to and it's a slightly different test than what I was describing before but where you would look for these somatic mutations you described this before but when you're looking for that needle in a hay stack if you've got a tumor that's going to Slough off some of that DNA into the circulation you might be able to see some of that fragmented

[01:03:18] DNA floating around and you might be able to pick up some of those mutations that might be reflective of that mammory cell that's either gone aai and is a cancer but maybe not something that you're detecting on mamography or something else and so this is in some ways been the Holy Grail of being able to do cancer screening it's not quite ready for prime time yet um and people think about it more I would say right now for thinking about recurrence of cancer so how do you monitor someone who's had a previous cancer diagnosis you think they're all clear and seeing whether or not they've had a recurrence um the other use case people have thought about is someone who might be at high risk of cancer so someone who's identified in whatever reason based on an exposure based on a genetic profile but it's not ready yet for population screening in terms of being able to pick up cancers at an earlier stage we're still relying on other things to do that so let's now talk about what happens at the the level of the the the 23 and M and the ancest ancestries uh and companies that are obviously doing something far less than a whole genome sequence or even even a whole exome sequence just on the basis of the cost at which they can offer these things what are they technically doing with the epithelial cell of your cheek or the saliva or the white blood cells that they get so again and I'll say read the fine print of what you sign on the consent form um number one it may change over time and I don't represent any of those companies so I don't want to missp in terms of what they're doing they are in general though number one not trying to detect cancer so any what I talked about not the purpose of what they're doing they're in general not trying to read out the genome at least not for the purpose of getting you medical information for what I call news you can use to manage your own health care they're largely doing it in a way that

[01:05:10] I'll call more recreational and so with doing that for any of you who have done 23 and me you may find out something about for instance uh if you were to eat asparagus what your urine might smell like or what your ear wax might be like or if you're uh lactose intolerant they are things that are related to how the biology of your body works they are related to genetic variant so those two things go together but they're not telling you based on your ear wax if you're going to have major problems with hearing loss down the road or you know cancer risk or things like that so that's why I use the term recreational in that way but what are they technically doing like so they are yep so uh depending on the company and depending on what they're doing they're often times reading out what we call single nucleotide uh polymorphisms or so-called snips so they're not reading out the entirety of your genome they're not reading out all three billion base pairs they are selectively going in and saying at this exact address do you have an A or do you have a g at this other address here do you have a c or do you have a g and based on that they may selectively look at those particular variants and say with your profile I know that your family you know originally came from Egypt uh or wherever it is you know in terms of being able to look at an stress free where they may say based on looking at this I know this particular genetic variant may predispose you to be lactose intolerant I would expect that you're going to have problems in terms of eating ice cream for dessert tonight um so you know that's generally the type of thing they're reporting out um depending on again the company and the terms of the agreements there may be differences but generically that's what many of them are doing and so if a gene differs by more than one nucleotide a snip is not of much use I mean you unless you sample two snips in the same gene gets tricky um so technically a single nucleotide polymorphism could be a genetic variant that has a big big effect on a gene and could from a medical point of view be very very impactful so it's not just the size that matters it's you know as some people would say location location location it's like real estate so um it it all matters which variant we're talking about but in general the ones that they're looking at are not the ones that are medically impactful they're just normal variants that are innocent bystanders but help us understand where our ancestors came from for the most part that's what the companies are doing although they do comment on some important ones so you mentioned isoforms as normal variant so the apoe gene has three isoforms the two three the four isopor all are relatively common I mean the three being the most common then the four the two is not that common but but all would be considered quote unquote normal variants one obviously comes with a much higher risk of neurodegenerative disease um a 23 and me test does read out that prediction um so presumably that tells us that those genes only really differ by one base pair correct the two the three the four only differ by one base pair that's therefore the only place they need to sample um but

[01:08:18] I've seen in 10 years several instances of a Mis call meaning the snip read ends up not matching with the more rigorous uh exome sequence uh why do you think that's the case is is that does that surprise you so I I will say that you know in doing this I'm not someone you know that has been asked to go in and QC or do quality control or anything like that for the Laboratories I have known of things as simple as um these are done in place plates that often times are 12 by 8 plates and if you flip the plate the other way you can have sample switches and you've got a different person being read out for a different thing it can be something as simple as a logistic like that and I have seen that lab eror before um there can be sample switches at multiple places and at the end of the day I will say that if you are doing something from the recreational side to something where you were going to make a major healthc care decision you were as in a woman for instance going to go through and have a mastectomy get a second opinion right like be sure that this is really you and it's really the result you think it is before you do anything irreversible or you know go out and buy that big life insurance policy um because you know I and I would say that in general you know if you were getting a second opinion about cancer diagnosis so you mentioned the guardian study earlier can you can you say a little bit more about what that study is so the guardian study um as you can imagine based on what I started out the conversation with fenel ke and Nua is um I've always been uh wanting to be able to get information that people could use to be able to maximize health and being able to just be the best person they could be and I started out in 1996 I again had started out in the space of PKU decades ago and um had been studying a disease called spinal muscular atrophy for about a decade with colleagues of mine and this is a neurodegenerative condition and used to be the most common genetic cause of death for children less than 2 years of age and I realized um starting in 199 uh rather uh um starting in 2016 that we were just at the cusp of potentially a treatment that might slow down or stop the neurod degeneration yet tragically if we didn't identify babies before they started showing symptoms it would be too late that is we'd have this window of opportunity so we started out a newborn screening program for SMA and then babies that were identified through that had the option if they wanted to of going into a clinical trial that ended up being quite synergistic in the sense that we did identify babies who would have been predicted to have the most severe type of SMA they did get into early clinical trials right away they did benefit from those that helped in terms of the ultimate evidence that was necessary to show the efficacy of those treatments and because of that um and because we were able to show that we could do it technically and that people wanted it um SMA has been added to the recommended Universal screening panel for babies across the United States and so now 4 million babies born each year in the United States are screened for

[01:11:29] SMA and we have three FDA approved treatments including a oneandone gene therapy so babies can now be identified within the first week or two of Life get a oneandone IV infusion of the genene and uh go on to have a a much much better life if not uh you know be quote unquote normal at least as far as we can see so far so that got me thinking about um sort of doing this on larger scale we've since done uh newborn screening study for duchaine muscular distrophy and just recently actually was FDA approved a treatment for for DMD duan's muscular distrophy um but I'm I don't know I'm getting older and I'm getting more impatient and I didn't want to do these one by one I started thinking about how could we do these at scale for population Health then not just for one condition at a time but how could we do it for dozens or hundreds or potentially even more conditions and so uh the guardian study actually stands for something it stands for genomic uniform screening against rare diseases in all newborns and if you put the letters together from that it spells out guardian and the idea behind that is to take that same newborn screening dried blood spot that we use already for PKU that we talked about sequence The genome we don't need to read out everything in the genome we only read out the genes that we consent people to read to that that they consent to in the study and those genes are genes that have I call it news can use information that has treatment immediately available and in planning this study for almost uh 4 years or just over four years with families we had many many iterations about what they wanted what they wanted us to screen for what should be what should enable them to be the best parents and give their children the best uh chance at a healthy life and we thought about also this Dynamic change in what we'd have treatments for the fact that the world is changing rapidly and we wanted the flexibility that if a new treatment became approved tomorrow boom we could instantly change the screen and be able to implement that we wouldn't have to wait a decade to gather the evidence to do that we wanted to be nimble and flexible so the reason for using the genome as the backbone is it gives us that infinite flexibility to be able to adapt and to be able to move the field forward so we've been doing the guardian study in New York City since

[01:13:50] September 2022 and right now have screened just over 3,000 babies and it really has been remarkable to me in terms of being able to see um just the broad support from our community in doing this in New York City uh you should realize you Pro most of the listeners probably do realize the wonderful diversity we have in New York city that is that of the people who participate um it's not just uh white folks it's not just people who are from

[01:14:16] Ireland we were talking about Irish um uh individuals in PKU but it's people from around the world we have um about a quarter a quarter a quarter qu people of European ancestry of Latina ancestry of black ancestry of Asian and other ancestry so it becomes really I think representativeness or representative basically of the world um and it also is geared to leave no baby behind um because newborn screening is kind of this one universal thing where everyone goes through the health system in the same way and by making this free and being able to uh allow everyone to enter if they so chose uh we can really see also what people what people information people want and what they don't want um within this I guess one of the things that's been refreshing to me is to see that about 74% of parents that we approach and offer this to decide they want to do this and that's an important number to me when we did this for SMA the number was 93% when we did this for duchaine muscular distrophy it was 84% and So within this it's not 100% of people who want any of these genetic screens and that's perfectly fine I'm trying to force anyone to do anything but it's also not 10% um the majority of parents are saying yes if there's something I can do to ensure that I have a healthier child like imp like give it to me like help me be a better parent why would I not want to do this is mostly what we hear uh within this I also appreciate and we do this with regular newborn screening just the traditional newborn screening and we realize that traditional newborn screening isn't perfect I never thought it was nothing ever is but we realize that adding this additional Dimension and we've even done it for PKU within this study this an additional Dimension helps us to do a better job and so just as an example uh We've also identified part of newborn screening identifies some children with severe combined immuno deficiency um a problem where you can have an overwhelming infection and die from this but a treatments is available including a bone marrow transplant and so because of that we have as part of newborn screening um a way to screen and identify some but not all children that have that we've added this now genome sequencing to enrich and improve that and in fact identified a baby that was missed by our traditional newborn screening for skid um yet is at increased risk in terms of this overwhelming infection but yet with the opportunity to intervene at an early stage when a bone marrow transplant will be most effective um and so there are numerous examples where we've identified whether it's Wilson's disease whether it's severe combined immuno deficiency whether it's a condra plasia but other conditions that are treatable that we just needed to identify those babies and as we've done that the number of children that and I just know because

[01:17:04] I've been practicing in New York City for 25 years I know sort of how people navigate the system and and how they get through and we've been able to really get to many of the people who are usually um unfortunately Left Behind either because they're immigrants they don't speak the language they don't have the same health insurance uh but individuals that we're seeing come out positive for this are very very different in terms of reflecting our community than the people who navigate the Health Care system and get into to see us and we realize based on other studies that we've done that most of the children that would have been diagnosed if ever they were diagnosed on average aren't diagnosed until somewhere between 8 9 10 years of age and so we're intervene or we're able to identify them literally a decade earlier uh before a lot of damage has been done to their body so it's just the beginning you know 3,000 is great I think it demonstrates that we can do this I think it tells us what our community wants out of this um it shows us some pitfalls in terms of

[01:18:03] How It's hard to do and what we need to do to do it better but I do fully believe that this both der risks this in terms of being able to also have um groups that are working on therapies uh be able to realize that this is something there's an opportunity now for treatment for this and is a powerful way of moving forward Health Equity at least for children for the Next Generation is this something that's done only at colia or is it a multi-center New York uh Hospital Endeavor so right now this is done through our New York

[01:18:33] Presbyterian Hospital System so it's not just Columbia but it's through um this Hospital network uh it's only so far in those hospitals but based on our success for this we are figuring out how we can be able to expand this um more broadly and really think about this as I said as integrating within the public health infrastructure not trivial to do uh not trivial to do this on scale as an example doing this in New York state if we were to do this for every baby we'd need to do it for about 210,000 babies a year so um no small feat but something that we're we're gaining the experience to know what the pain points are and how to solve for them is this all funded by

[01:19:10] NIH So within this as you can imagine this is not inexpensive to do so in fact none of this is funded by NIH um NIH I won't go into all the details but NIH is able to fund programs that are about this big people may may not see this if they're just listening to me but a very small amount uh this ends up being about two orders of magnitude larger in cost than anything that NIH can fund and so it's a challenge in terms of as you think about big bold new transformative ideas how do we as a scientific

[01:19:41] Community accomplish these and so uh we've done this by putting together many different stakeholders I don't think any one group could be able to take this on and truth be told we're not completely there with the funding I think we needed to demonstrate that we actually could do this in this first feasibility stage uh before gaining the resources to do this with what I hope will be at least a 100,000 babies to get to the sample size we need to see some of these rare conditions and to know what the outcomes are and that we really can screen for them so what's the um actual cost of doing the sequence for each of the uh for each baby so to look at those 250 some odd uh conditions what's the what's the bench cost so as we started out doing this uh round number $1,000 per baby so thinking about generating the data interpreting the data getting it back to folks cost of about $1,000 per baby um the goal is to be able to do this and get it down by the order of magnitude can we get it down to $100 per baby as an example and in doing that can we think about the economic impact most importantly the health impact for the baby but as we think about as a society how to be able to you know afford doing this we are doing the economic analysis to understand but the good thing is sequencing costs are decreasing analysis interpretation costs are decreasing more of this can be done in automated ways as we understand what normal variation is for people around the world and that's one of the critical factors is doing that around the world now that $1,000 is a fully loaded cost that's the interpretation that's the overhead that's the pi time and such right the sequence and cost must be significantly less than that given that a whole genome sequence can be actually SE Aluma could do a whole genome sequence for $1,000 now right so uh even over the course of this study the sequencing costs have come down if you can imagine it and we just started it like I said September 2022 less than a year ago but already the sequencing costs have come down I expect they'll continue to come down in terms of this and so uh data generation certainly can be done for well less than $1,000 now um but as you said part of it is the interpretation and we have study staff that explain the study to everyone explain you know results to par so yep includes multiple pieces so at the outset of this discussion you mentioned that SMA actually has a successful gene therapy I was not aware of that yes um how many of these um uh single Gene highly penetrant conditions that that you know children are born with be it inborn eras of metabolism or neurod degener diseases Etc how many of them have FDA approved Gene therapies already not very many of them so really the shining example is SMA or spinal muscular atrophy um there are very few

[01:22:29] Gene therapies that are now approved um there are now uh for instance I mentioned duchaine muscular distrophy um you know hemophilia there are a few other conditions but it is still a literally a handful for for gene therapy literally gene therapy others have treatments available and I think for many of those um I'll just give one example that we've had through the uh

[01:22:52] Guardian study a condition called Wilson syndrome for instance that leads to ultimately liver failure and need for liver transplant um the treatment that we give children for this is zinc so it's something that it doesn't require gene therapy it doesn't need anything that fancy we can simply use zinc to out compete copper and make sure that we don't end up with an copper overload situation and we have treatments that are very well tolerated Pennies A Day In terms of doing this we hope uh extremely effective long term so although gene therapy is wonderful I want to underscore we don't always need gene therapy as long as we have that early diagnosis if there were three diseases today that you see in the Pediatric practice that would be most amenable to gene therapy in terms of some aggregate score of the technical nature of doing the gene therapy and the lack of alternative therapies elsewhere and the number of kids Afflicted if you were sort of to take that as your triple proxy what would be if you could wave a magic wand what would be the three diseases you would want to put high on the list of gene therapy targets H that's a great question I don't think

[01:24:05] I've ever thought that through exactly in that way so um I guess what I continue to come back to in many cases um there so there are a lot of neurological conditions let me start with that in terms of places that we are uh woefully behind in terms of treatments and I'll give you one shining example of T sax disease as an example um many individuals uh the way they've dealt with this because there's no treatment is simply not having children or not having children uh together or um you know going through other reproductive options but things like uh taac disease is just a terrible condition because you your B and it has relatively High population prevalence uh to one of your points and has really nothing available in terms of treatment today um and so those children are B born healthy normal children and and die within the first few years of life with a degenerative uh course often times associated with epilepsy so uh a condition TX or a condition like that I think uh fulfills all the criteria that you're talking about um other similar conditions like that um although you know I think we still need to understand treatability or things like fragile X another condition that we see uh in this case XL um by the you can tell from the name fragile X similar in terms of high frequency um really nothing in terms of treatability at this point and perhaps the ability it's a we can get into it or not but the gene therapy for this is a little bit trickier U different strategy from a technical point of view than what one one would take for tack so whether it's gen therapy or Gene editing or other types of things there would be a different technical strategy um and then I would say I they're just a large group I I won't pick one but large groups of inborn errors in in terms of liver disease or that primarily affect the liver so whether you're talking about something like maple syrup urine disease uh proprionic acidemia but something like that that we have good programs in place to identify those childrens and our treatments um they're just not up to

[01:26:25] Snuff yet they're not quite as good as they should be well let's talk about how genetic therapy works so um God probably 23 years ago we had uh uh a tragedy in one of the most um uh highly publicized examples of of early gene therapy uh the the tragedy of course really didn't have to do directly with the gene therapy it had to do with the vector that was used to deliver it and um the the young man who received that Gene I can't remember what it was for it was for an in inborn

[01:26:59] ER of metabolism as well wasn't it uh a Ura cycle defect called ornithine transc carbamol deficiency yeah and uh Jesse what was his last name Jesse Ginger Ginger yeah and this was at Penn at chop right that's right uh about the year 2000 if my memory I think that's about right yeah yeah Y and so let's talk about that uh again I'm let's talk technically about that right so what what was the so they used an adov virus but explain what that means and what you know what was the state-of-the-art 25ish years ago and um and let's contrast that with what's being done today sure um so for those of you are listening adov viruses obviously causes the common cold and so whether it's Ado or Ado Associated virus we often times use that as the vector or the delivery vehicle to deliver genes um within this uh the viruses are manipulated they're engineered so to speak so that they're not going to be contagious so even though you might get a cold or pass it along to someone you're not going to do that with gene therapy yet there problems with this because the common cold is common and so people may have been infected with adov viruses and their body may try and mount an immune response when it's infected uh as it would be with a cold um and that's where a lot of the

[01:28:26] Mischief comes in and unfortunately it hasn't ended with Jesse um and Jesse's death uh there have been other deaths in the gene therapy space with others that have had a response to the vectors uh oftentimes an immunological response to that um in Jesse gelsinger's case it was um the vector in the gene therapy was targeted at the liver we've talked about a little bit of that already um but sometimes there can be an over helming response from the liver um where the liver starts to fail um where there's an immune response uh that goes on and so as I said this has not been solved completely at this point there have been other genetic therapies other diseases not just liver diseases but where there have been similar responses and I think one of the things that we've learned from this is we have to be very careful with people with underlying liver disease when it comes to this because the a fragile liver can get tipped over especially with adob us we also have to be careful about who's been exposed to those viruses so sometimes we do screens to be able to see who might have one of these responses um but ultimately and partly because of that people have also been trying to figure out other Delivery

[01:29:37] Systems other vehicles other ways of being able to get those genes into cells that may not be as toxic or problematic so help me understand a little bit you know so an adenovirus is very common so presumably in the case of Jesse he'd already been exposed to some antigen that relate was related to this and so he already had memory B cells and memory T cells that were ready to mount a healthy immune response should he have been exposed to that uh very common adov virus again does that imply the fact that he had such a harsh response to the gene therapy was that because of the dose of adov virus that he received or does that imply that he would have had some sort of catastrophic multi-stem organ failure had he just had another exposure to that exact adov virus as a cold and that it as you said was a function of his underlying Liver Health so it's a very tricky situation and I say this because there will be some either patients or doctors advising patients about genetic therapies or genetic uh therapy trials in the future

[01:30:43] It's tricky in the following sense um you're right that there's a dose response in terms of the immunological response and so you don't want to go too high on the dose because you don't want to have to Big a response on the other hand with these Gene therapies you often times get one chance at this in terms of doing this because once you've given the therapy um the body is going to mount a an immune response to that and would neutralize that same therapy if you were to give that again and so the tricky thing about this is you don't want to go too high and you don't want to go too low because if you underdose it and if you don't get enough in and that's your one shot on goal you've burned it and so within this it's a tricky situation to figure out how to get it just right and as it is with many clinical trials when you're first inh human you don't know right it is first inum often times they're non-human primates in terms of trying to figure out as much as you can but it's still not a person and each person is unique and so as you're doing it um it is a tricky situation in terms of getting it right when you do the first person you learn and you figure out from there whether you're going to go higher or lower but there is someone who's going to be the first person and there's no way to engineer the adov virus to make it invisible to the immune system while still able to insert its DNA package into the cell so there's certainly things that we do to try and do this better as I alluded to one of the advantages for someone uh for instance with SMA where we're dosing them at a week or two of life is they're they haven't had the common cold they haven't been exposed to these things they've got a fresh immune system so the likelihood they're going to have a response like this is much lower so we haven't been seeing those types of things with newborns that we've been treating with us ma um there are other vectors that or not just vectors other delivery vehicles that we use that are not viruses and so that's something else that in terms of developing new technologies um things that may not pose the same problems I I don't want to guarantee that that's going to be the case but certainly uh with the experience we've had even from the covid vaccine from mRNA vaccines and having

[01:32:47] Delivery Systems that were basically lipid nanop particles to deliver nucleic acids to cells we've learned a tremendous amount from millions of people who have been treated with that and some of those Technologies may prove to be helpful um with other Delivery Systems maybe this is a good time to explain what crisper is and how it factors into Gene editing although I guess before we do that maybe one thing to do before that is to explain what is required to change a gene so um like I don't know pick pick someone with um uh CLE cell anemia so if you wanted to use gene therapy to fix quote unquote

[01:33:42] CLE cell anemia my vague recollection from high school or from rather Medical School biochemistry is that was a one amino acid change correct correct is it was valine one of them was so the E amino acid exactly in hemoglobin beta is that um there are two different sort of variations or flavors at that amino acid you can change but that causes sickle C cell disease yes okay so if you want to permanently change that it's not enough to do it in the red blood cells that are floating around in the bloodstream because they're going to be trashed in the spleen a couple of months from now you must change the DNA of the stem cells in the marrow correct it's exactly right you have to get those progenitor cells from which the future generations of red cells will be derived and let's assume you had the correct Gene sequence that's not hard to do we know what that is and we can put that into a virus and maybe just explain to people why viruses are great Vehicles what what is it about a virus that makes it an ideal candidate here well the nice thing about a virus is it was designed by Mother Nature doing infect our cells right so it's pretty good at being able to do that um the viruses that you're talking to and the way that I think about them are often helpful for Gene addition so where you've got a protein product that hasn't shown up for work it's not working it's a loss of function it's not present you need to be able to deliver or add back that Gene it may not be integrated into your genome and in fact there're probably some advantages if it's not but the virus can bring that in and bring it into the cells and to your point and this is important many times that means bringing it into stem cells so that they can have the longevity of continuing to populate the body over time and so is it safe to say that their real challenge is that step it's not just putting the corrected version of hemoglobin the gene for the corrected version of hemoglobin into the the virus of choice it's figuring out how to get that to selectively infect a progenitor stem cell with within the bone marrow um is that presumably why we don't yet have genetic therapy for Cle cell anemia well

[01:36:01] CLE cell is um interesting in that there are a couple different strategies people think of so one is Gene editing is the term I'm going to use um so it's fixing the gene in in in sort of where it is uh uh not adding a gene but actually fixing the gene that's present another strategy that people think about um again for the fados who are thinking about that as I mentioned hemoglobin beta uh in terms of the adult form of hemoglobin there's also fetal hemoglobin that's made in utero and so with that that actually has a very tight binding of oxygen because the fetus needs to be able to get oxygen from the maternal blood and it can substitute for adult hemoglobin actually quite efficiently and so one thing one can do is actually turn up the amount of fetal hemoglobin expression and essentially be the insitu version of your gene therapy it's it's just manipulating the gene expression but for a gene that's already present in those individuals and so there are ways of manipulating gene expression in that case for fetal hemoglobin so there are multiple ways to skin a cat so to speak um very technically different in terms of what we administer to people and what we're changing in terms of the gene therapy but I want to pick up on what you were talking about with Gene editing because that's yet something else that's really Inu yeah and I want to I want to come back to that let's go back to one more thing on the gene addition if you were to add a gene for a corrected version of beta hemoglobin would you actually run into a problem now where you're making too much hemoglobin and half of it is appropriate and half of it is Sickle and therefore not and you could argue you're creating more problems because you've doubled the hemoglobin but you still have the issue where the cells sickle and create all of the distal esia that the person has so is that the real reason that nobody's interested in doing an addition uh therapy for Cle cell anemia so that's exactly right just for the listeners we don't use the gene addition strategy for

[01:38:09] Cle cell anemia because we'd have to dilute out so to speak so much of the hemoglobin with the sickling that physiologically run into other problems okay so Gene editing would hands down be the best solution for certainly a situation like that and probably many cases could it be done with High Fidelity and ease so um I I guess let's talk about Gene editing in any way you see fit and in whatever way you want to tell the story

[01:38:41] I Mean Gene editing in of itself is a whole podcast I suppose but uh but but what's the you know what's the the medium version of that story yeah so from a simplistic way of thinking about this it's going in in and insight to being able to correct the genetic variant now realizing we've talked about single nucleotide variants those are the easiest ones to edit there's just one single base pair that needs to be flipped uh it actually matters what that base pair is if you have to change an a to a g or a c to a t believe it or not there are different base editors that can do different types of nucleotide switches um but there are many mutations that are not just single nucleotides there may be multiple nucleotides there may be multiple repeat these sort of complex things that we talked about with fragile X there may be entire chunks of chromosomes they get very complicated and furthermore it may be when you think about population genetics um you may have a mutation distribution across a gene that may be quite heterogeneous CLE cell is an easy one in the way that you mentioned you're talking about the same position for everyone with CLE cell disease couple different nucleic acids but it's the same position essentially whereas other genetic conditions it may be that almost everyone has a different mutation so you have lots of different things you need to edit and that may be easier or more difficult to do so there are some nuances in terms of that um you mentioned crisper so crisper cast 9 is something that many will know because uh

[01:40:10] Nobel laurates were awarded um for this amazing discovery which was by the way I will say um just really good science with creative women who are thinking about other ways to use it um it wasn't fundamentally uh the discovery was not made with the intention of doing genetic engineering or you know genetic manipulations but really smart people thinking about it um the crisper cast 9 system has I think of it as an Achilles heel of a doubl stranded DNA break so it fundamentally in terms of being able to make the correction has to cut the DNA cutting the two strands of the DNA to make the correction and that fundamentally leads to some instability as the cell repairs that process which you use the word Fidelity which I like the use of that term because it really is all about Fidelity and potential off-target effects where you inadvertently introduce other than the intended correction other genetic changes and sometimes those other genetic changes can cause Mischief we call them of Target effects so things where they may um inadvertently destroy the gene cause other changes to the gene cause other changes to other genes that you weren't even trying to Target but it can lead to problems of essentially promiscuity or inaccuracy or low

[01:41:27] Fidelity this is to me in my opinion the Achilles heal in terms of that particular system so there are others um in terms of thinking about other Technologies other strategies that in terms of doing a double stranded DNA break will do a single stranded DNA break so it'll Nick just one of the two copies which in terms of the process that the cellular Machinery has for the repair of that ends up being a much higher Fidelity system system so there are lower of Target lower error rates um it tends to be a more robust system so this is still very very early I want to underscore this very early in terms of doing this there are lots of other complexities besides the Machinery of I what I just described was Prime editing but other complexities in terms of the

[01:42:14] Machinery to go in and make the changes uh what types of mutations can be repaired Prime editing has strategies to be able to do just not single nucleotides but much more complex mutations to be able to fix um but ultimately it's a vehicle for delivery it's getting in early enough before the damage is done to the body it's being able to get to the part of the body safely that you need to um so there it's sort of multiple pieces of the puzzle that have to all be solved simultaneously to get the whole package to work so we're not quite there yet but

[01:42:48] I am optimistic that we're we are as a lot of scientists working together real in that this may be one sort of solution eventually when all the components are there that may be scalable to deal with many different types of genetic conditions you were alluding to the differences in strategies between TX and fragile X syndrome do we have enough information now in this discussion for you to explain the different strategies there sure um I think so so let's start with tasac um tasac is due to an enzyme that's missing um we talked about recessives it's a recessive condition uh this is a degenerative condition and so you want to be able to get in early for all the reasons that we've talked about and you could do a gene addition the gene the enzyme is missing so you can just pop it back in doesn't have to integrate you just need to get it early enough to do its job and not to uh cause any Mischief along the way so that strategy would be a good strategy the tough part you need to get it into the brain and as you get it into you know as you're thinking about the delivery system um brain is a complex organ so you want to be able to get it throughout the brain for for function fragile X is more so what does that what does that mean Wendy that means you'd have to introduce a like an intranasal virus that can is this is this something in gal cells in neurons where does this enzyme normally get made yep so uh within this as you said um there are multiple ways to access the brain it's obviously a protected space in terms of the bloodb brain barrier um I doubt we're going to be able to do it with intranasal although you know there is some that you can get um by putting this uh in that way um some cases we do intrathecal so for women who've had an epidural it's basically the same way that we access the space for an epidural in some cases um for anyone who's thought about chemotherapy that we give for brain cancer sometimes we actually have to do it uh Into The ventricle and we sounds a little bit barbaric uh but we go through the skull and being able to do the injections there um but you know there it it's not as simple my point is it's not not as simple as a simple intravenous infusion it's not like we can just give it peripherally and get it to the brain where we need to um so it's challenging in that way and as we think about it in some cases we need to get throughout the brain even into deep nuclei or different parts of the brain so as as an example if you were to inject it and you had a high concentration on the left but it didn't get to the right that would be a problem right you need to be able to get uh even distribution as we're doing this so um anyway with with TX though it is the case that as I was alluding to before you probably don't need to get to 100% of the protein or the enzyme that's there even 50% I'm sure is enough and it's possible you could get down to 20% and that would be just fine um and so that's one strategy fragile X is a little bit more complicated the actual mutation itself is what we call a a trinucleotide repeat um a repeat that's too big and so we need to be able to make it smaller uh within doing this it also has the same problems in terms of being in the brain but it's not just simply adding back some additional fragile X protein so we can't just make it a gene addition strategy we've got to really think about the gene editing that

[01:46:05] I was alluding to where you're fixing uh shrinking the size of that repeat back down to the normal size um what's unknown uh and I think one of the things we don't know until we do it in people is what is that window of treatability and uh just to be provocative to let the the listeners think about this is that window even if Guardian worked perfectly and we could identify these babies with this within the first week of life um is that early enough U of course my hope is that for many conditions that will be um it's possible that we'll need to go even earlier and so there are some people that have thought about even in utero gene therapy or genetic treatments for some conditions not all of them but for some conditions where it might be necessary to get even during development fetal development to have the maximal effect so not saying we're going there anytime soon but just to sort of think through that um there may be imperfect

[01:46:59] Solutions unless one gets to the right time and the right place and to your point the right cell type even and and fragile X is also a recessive condition so it can only impact women presumably because you would need both copies of the X so uh fragile X is uh we do call it an xlink recessive but what that also means is that it's mostly males who are affected because males only have the 1X if they have that repeat expansion uh the males will be um affected females can be affected although it's much more unusual um because they would need to have got the ex from their father as well that's it y um I want to come back and talk more at the end of our discussion uh about kind of the future of Gene editing and the ethics around it and things like that which I'm sure is something you've thought a lot about but before we do that I want to talk about some of the more complex diseases that um clearly have a genetic component um but but they're probably much more polygenic so um let's start with what you know your colleagues down the hall are doing uh with respect to obesity how much do we understand about the genetics of obesity and does genetic therapy therapy play any role there so I'll start out about talking with obesity but I may switch gears uh at some point soon after that so obesity we have ways of calculating heritability um it's to give us a scientific Insight of how genetic is a certain condition so you can do this by looking at twins for instance you can look at identical twins you fraternal twins and you can see how similar they are in terms of body mass index adiposity things like that as measures of obesity um and it does end up being highly heritable it's not the most heritable Factor but it is highly heritable so that sort of points in One

[01:48:52] Direction genes are important what's the heritability of obesity by the way so the heritability running somewhere around 50% for round numbers um or 0. five um other conditions that are extremely heritable of course are closer to one so type as an example and by comparison type two diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes more heritable more strongly genetic in terms of that and type one type 1 diabetes less uh heritable um a complex interaction both of your immune system and the genetics that govern your immune system but also what you're exposed to early on and and sort of the Cross reaction your immune system has between self and nonself so um a little bit different model um on the other hand uh clearly there are I'll call them environmental differences right and so you can look at what's happened to the average body mass index of the average

[01:49:46] American over the last generation our genes haven't changed right but on the other hand um by most measures you can see that we're uh more prosperous uh in general the average body mass index has increased and there have been some interesting studies looking at uh particular um groups of Puma Native Americans for instance that have genetically the same genes they come from the same original Community but they live in different environments one in which it's more sort of a traditional environment in terms of um the amount of access to calorically dense foods and the amount of physical energy that's expended on a day-to-day basis and those same original groups but in two different environments you see much more obesity in the one group uh that has ready access to again obesogenic Foods versus the the other that um doesn't so again strongly suggesting that it's not just the genes in terms of this um now on the other hand uh and this goes back to you were describing Rudy liel and his original work in terms of identifying leptin and the leptin receptor through positional cloning methods um leptin and the leptin receptor in terms of mutations in those genes do not account for the vast majority of obesity very rare I I've certainly had patients with these conditions but that's just because of the nature of who I am but very rare and most people would not have seen this on the other stand understanding the fundamental biology of how body weight is regulated and governed critical in terms of understanding those two molecules and my point in this is I don't know if it's going to be for obesity but it may be for other conditions like myocardial infarctions or coronary artery disease that knowing about the biology and sort of the final common mechanism or the final common pathway through which the biology is regulated one may have ways of either pharmacologically or some will say in terms of gene therapy being able to make permanent manipulations so statins as an example in terms of treatment for hyper cholesterol Emy there may be various different genetic mechanisms by which one has an increased risk for a heart attack yet Statin seem to work for a lot of different people and some have thought that for instance rather than using that as a medication would there be a way of genetically making a manipulation so it's kind of a one time and not having to require continued ongoing therapy so I I'm not saying you know that this is exactly where obesity treatment is going to be going um and I am in a good way excited that um we certainly have better treatments for the first time I think for obesity now than we had five or 50 years ago so we may be going in a better direction we didn't really talk about epigenetics but I think obesity might be a good time to do a little bit of backtracking and explain what the epig genome is and how it changes not just over a person's life but perhaps more importantly from one generation to the next and the reason I'm asking the question is wonder if it's playing a role in the propagation of obesity across Generations even though as you pointed out we're not really experiencing much genetic drift in the period of time that we're seeing an explosion in obesity and so with all of that said my question is ultimately do you think epigenetic changes could be incre could be explaining the increase we see in obesity um as a susceptibility to obesogenic environmental factors I think the bottom line is we don't know um but for those who don't know what the term epigenetics is um break it down Epi above and then genetics the genes and so there are chemical modifications that happen to the genome which are used to affect Gene regulation some of those uh chemical modifications include methylation and those are dynamic they can change over the life course they can change by cell type and their ways to be able to coordinate regulation of potentially groups of genes they're tricky to analyze from a a methodological point of view scientifically they're tricky because they do vary over the life course and they vary by cell type or tissue and so um using for instance we've talked about this a lot but using a blood sample uh as a matter of trying to get the epigenetic profile for what's going on in your brain or your pancreas doesn't always work and it's hard to even know whether or not it works because it's not as if we're going in and doing pancreatic or brain biopsies on most people so you know you can do things in animal models you can get some indirect evidence but it's hard to know for sure whether or not this is truly answering the question you're trying to answer so I'll say there's a lot of conjecture in the area of epigenetics and hard to know for sure exactly what that is on the other hand um I will say that we've known about something called the Audy Mouse um which is a mouse model for obesity and depending on how much folate you give that Mouse for instance uh while the um the dam the mother Mouse is uh carrying her pregnancy her her uh her little mice uh depending on the amount of folate in her diet does affect the epigenetics uh folate is used in terms of methylation for the DNA and so you can see a read out of the effect and depending on that you can see a change in the coat color you can see a change in the Obesity for these Audy mice and for their progeny um and there are things in terms of as you said transgenerational potentially uh I we don't entirely know the mechanism of how that might be occurring whether it's epigenetics or other things um but there are things that we can see but these are complicated so I'll I'll just say I personally don't feel like scientifically we have all the evidence to make definitive conclusions at this point um but but one wonders about what many different contributors could be although I have to guess that this is not going to be the major major driver let's pivot to autism now um autism is in the news all the time it seems and uh it certainly appears as though it's increasing in uh frequency and it's unclear how much of that is due to an increase in diagnosis uh and recognition versus how much of that is triggered by other environmental factors but uh there doesn't seem to be much um confusion around the fact that there's a strong genetic component to it so let's start with that uh based on all of the twin studies uh what is the heritability of autism y so the heritability I I will say to your point um autism is even within the name a spectrum um so it's not just one condition it's a spectrum and it goes from uh severe um what some people will call profound autism um it can be associated with intellectual disabilities to other individuals at the mild quote unquote milder end um who are have are quite talented in many ways yet have Social Challenges So within that entire Spectrum if one includes everything within that the heritability is estimated to be approximately 8 although some individuals will say even as high as 0.9 um the point within that though is that it's not 100% and in fact we do know of um times over the life course in particular prenatal in early childhood that are important to the developing brain and where uh changes in exposure beyond the genes can play a role so as an example prematurity is one of the more common if you will exposures um but in terms of what happens to developing brain and if you are born when you're 26 weeks old U much higher probability of autism than if you're born at term at 40 weeks and so um there are other factors beyond just the genes that are involved but clearly um the other point that I'll make about heritability is one calculates heritability as a measure of the inherited genetic factors um but you mentioned it once already one of the factors in autism is that there are denovo or new genetic variants that occur for the first time in the individual with autism those individuals aren't captured in that measure of heritability because heritability is fundamentally trying to get it transmitted genetic variants that are going from parent to child and those Den noo genetic events are new in the child and so their genetic aspects not included inheritability if that makes sense y yep so what are the genes that seem to be responsible for autism uh so depending on who you ask and how you want to Define this there I think everyone would agree there are at least 100 genes that have been identified with high confidence as being associated with autism um depending on how rigorous you want to be about this process then you know some people would say that we estimate that there are at least a thousand genes and we probably you know are about a third of the way there in terms of uh having some sense of those genes not surprisingly those genes are genes that are in the brain they're expressed in the brain they function in the brain not surprisingly and many of those genes are especially early are active during developments and so what I mean is intrauterine fetal uh development within the brain specifically and what do they code for I mean how many of those genes would be genes in the exome versus the intron so um most of the ones we recognize underscore the ones we recognize are in the coding sequence but that's a limitation of what we recognize um we do realize that statistically we see that there is a signal in the non-coding space but we have less evidence to implicate specific genes or specific genetic variants individually in the non-coding space because the effect size or how powerful they are is somewhat somewhat reduced compared to those coding

[02:00:02] sequences um the other issue is not just where in the genes uh but what genes are involved and so the genes that are involved uh fundamentally can be genes that function at the synapse so the connections between brain cells and communicate between brain cells that happens to be one thing that's quite important um they can be cells that are rather genes that are important in regulation of genes and Gene networks so many of them are transcription factors histone modifiers we talked even about epigenetics some of those genes that may be responsible for those epigenetic changes but they often I think of them as having multiple Downstream genes that they affect so it's not having a very you know sort of focus it's more a universal effect that they have those genes that have that more Global Effect often times have a more Global Effect on brain function and cognition so it may not be that it's autism only but they may also be associated with intellectual disabilities they may be associated with epilepsy they may be associated with more sort of global effects in terms of brain function and to the extent that that term autism is used across the

[02:01:09] Spectrum there are often times those Individuals described as profound autism so there can be different things there can also be I I'll just put as an example um we mentioned I'll go back to PKU believe it or not not so I I happen to run a very large autism study called spark uh and within spark we identified a teenage young man who actually has his autism as a responsible of undiagnosed

[02:01:33] PKU so even even autism can be caused by you know full circle uh an inborn era of metabolism where there are toxic things that build up in the brain and then cause that dysfunction of the brain so uh not everything is a sort of primarily in terms of the brain but things that can diffuse to and have an effect on the function of the brain but to be clear autism is a clinical diagnosis in the same way that you know familial hypercholesterolemia is a familial is a phenotypic diagnosis it's a diagnosis in the case of FH where LDL cholesterol has to be above 190 milligrams per deciliter off treatment and it's incredibly heterogeneous in terms of the genes that are responsible to my last count I think there were more than 3,500 genes that could produce that phenotype of high LDL cholesterol so autism is the same right the diagnosis is clinical it's a phenotypic defined disease and maybe up to a thousand genes involved in in that or a thousand different ways to get there or more right exactly right so it is a DSM diagnosis in terms of clinical behavioral criteria um I know this gets confusing for people but one can have a gene that's identified as causal but the diag nosis is still a behavioral diagnosis um simply a gene associated with that and as you said not just one single Gene it doesn't map one to one in fact no one gene or genetic Factor accounts for more than 1% of individuals who have that clinical diagnosis of autism so incredibly heterogeneous and what's the approximate prevalence of autism today so round numberers 2% uh you were alluding to it before but this number has fluctuated over time whether it's for all the reasons you said but about 2% today does it just seem like it's more or is this really a function of Greater awareness so I think it's a function of several things um it doesn't help that the definition has changed over time so literally the DSM diagnostic criteria have changed over time and so for that not surprising the uh prevalence has changed over time um in a good way the there is greater recognition and diagnosis as you alluded to we've seen this in particular for underserved individuals that are more frequently diagnosed now so I think the disparities are decreasing and I think that's a good thing um but there are um also I'll I'll say you know maybe there are things that are changing in terms of society um changing the biology I don't know uh we haven't been able to put our finger on that but there are possible contributing factors with that um and then there's also a motivation to a certain extent in terms of the way our society Works to be able to access resources and so people that may not have been motivated to get a label per se they may still have known it they may have you know thought it to themselves but they didn't necessarily seek a diagnosis or label um except that there were resources educational resources support resources that were important and we want to make sure those individuals get those resources so what are some other both neurologic and non-neurologic seele of autism or call it comorbid conditions with autism so I think that's a good way to phrase it comorbid conditions is one of the things that um I think about so as an example some individuals will have epilepsy associated with their autism for some individuals that epilepsy will be recognized very early for some individuals it won't come until the teenagers or adolescents but that can be incredibly important um within this their are behavioral uh co-occurring diagnoses for instance of anxiety is quite frequent uh ADHD or attention issues again quite frequent um and I think some things we're just beginning to understand although I think it's incredibly important is that most of what we know about autism is based on individuals below the age of 20 um those are the individuals who've been studied most and I think there's a whole lot we don't know about adults with autism and

[02:05:32] I can say I do know some conditions that are associated um as degenerative conditions as well that when people are adults there may be particular subtypes of autism that are neurodegenerative because the genes that are involved are responsible for neurom maintenance being able to sustain the brain and continue functioning and when they're not functioning at some point uh start having things associated like parkinsonism um some subtypes that may be associated with increased risk of we mentioned obesity but believe it or not some of these same genes may also predispose to obesity and especially with some of the medications we use to treat some of these behavioral conditions uh even increase the effects the metabolic effects and weight gain and and diabetes associated with that um and there may be other things as well but to a large extent um I would say it's under recognized and and we have a lot of more gaps in our knowledge but many people who continue to need those that understanding and I think earlier you use the term of precision medicine I

[02:06:31] I don't mean it to sound like a cliche but you can imagine that it's a large percentage 2% of the population great heterogeneity everyone doesn't need to have the same sort of rules that they're following the same rulebook or the same management guidelines and how do we get greater specificity to not overburden people but yet to be able to also um you know allow them to be their their full to achieve their full potential and Lead their healthiest lives you mentioned that most of what we know about autism is based on studying people who are up to but below typically 20 years old does that suggest that prior to about the year 2000 there was nobody really studying this because presumably if we were we would know about what people look like later in life today yep so many of the adults with autism number one were not diagnosed as having autism they may have had you know some of these challenges but things have just changed over time um and so having a label having a diagnosis has changed with

[02:07:30] Society um other individuals who were studied 20 years ago have not been followed longitudinally and that's hard um you know there although there have been some epidemiological studies like Framingham uh that have followed individuals over long periods of time it's hard to be able to do that people move people you know investigators lose funding um people die I mean you know lots of things that happen and so just knowing what someone looked like at two and that same person at 22 there are very few studies uh in terms of in children what that looks like and so I think that's been a large part of the problem as well uh I mean I'm shocked to hear that the heritability is as high as it is 08 to 0.9 um what is it for other

[02:08:15] DSM conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia yeah so bipolar and disorder uh in schizophrenia certainly much lower um uh especially um and even things like depression major depression lower still uh so this is actually one of the highest heritable factors in terms of Behavioral Health or psychiatric conditions and and just approximately what are the heritability factors for those other conditions you just mentioned so more in the neighborhood of 0.5 to 6 or for something like major depression even lower maybe more like. 3 what is the implication by the way um if if the heritability is 8 to9 that almost implies for certain that an Autism person a person with autism will have an autistic child doesn't it that's only half the equation right so you know it takes two to tango in terms of making a child so both individuals are contributing genetic factors as we're thinking about this and so um and it's the combination of those factors together within that you know that combination um even if we're not talking about polygenic uh combination so in other words of those I think you said hundred to a thousand genes that seem to be implicated in autism some individuals with autism may only have one of those genes correct absolutely so some of them may have only one gene that's the predominant um sort of contributor in terms of this some will be more of that polygenic uh combination of factors but a single Gene individual has a 50 % chance of passing that Gene onto their offspring and assuming it's fully penetrant that they would have effectively a 40 to 50% chance of transmitting autism to their offspring that's correct now for the types of genes that you mentioned many of those individuals actually won't go on to have their own families and so one of the factors within this is that those highly penetrant single Gene factors um many individuals for instance you can imagine if they're not living independently if they're not veral you know they won pass those genes down let's pivot for a moment to cardiovascular disease um there are a couple of things that stand out from a genetic perspective one I've already mentioned briefly which is

[02:10:33] FH um the other is LP a attached to the LPA Gene I I believe that uh LP little a is the most uh prevalent uh atherogenic condition that is genetically Associated roughly one in 10 people have an elevated that that would be another great example of how Gene addition therapy would be of no use because you'd want to be Gene editing that um what else do we know about cardiovascular disease Beyond those two special cases of elevated LP littlea and familial hyper cholesterolemia how much of the rest of ascvd uh appears to be heritable well the interesting thing is um we alluded to this a little bit when we think about myocardial ctions hyper lipidemia in that sort of cardiovascular health um there may be genetic factors that are numerous but from a therapeutic point of view we may not Target all of those genetic contributors there may be final common biology and so I think that's the theme that I see most in terms of thinking about coronary artery disease my cardian farction things like that within the cardiovascular disease space though I do think they're interesting

[02:11:49] I'll just give one other example in terms of relatively common but rare disease that of cardiomyopathies and so when you think about genetic cardiomyopathies they affect on average about 1 in 500 individuals and so that's not one in a million it's also not 10% of the population right we're somewhere in the middle um and I will say that

[02:12:09] I've been I was waiting to see the data come out um but we've known about many of those genes for a long time we've known about the mutations we've known about uh frequency we've known about natural history and waiting to see whether or not genetic therapies would be effective for those conditions and it's not yet in people but I will say the early did are looking promising in terms of animal models to be able to reverse this or prevent this um I still think the heart is a tricky organ to be futzing with I'll just put it that way it always makes me a little bit nervous because you know electrical things can happen very suddenly and it's can be quite dangerous so you know that always makes me a little bit nervous to think about genetic therapies for the heart um but like I said some of the early data from the sidan in particular um look like there could be promising roads ahead and like I said it's a it's a common condition that you know otherwise oftentimes we treat with transplant um you know when we with the heart finally fails and so it' be be lovely if we didn't have to wait for hearts uh for transplant yeah it's interesting so going back to what you said about the the ascvd side it almost sounds to me like you're saying that if genetic therapies and treatments are going to be deployed against conditions especially like f you would really do it to more mimic the drug than you would to try to correct the defect and that makes a lot of sense in the case of FH because of the heterogeneity right there's no you know to have 5,000 different Gene therapies for the 5,000 different genes that can be altered in the result of of of hyperlipidemia is is a bad idea whereas if you can simply knock out pcsk9 as a gene you basically take care of everyone um and so let's talk about what that means technically so presumably there are genetic therapies that are already in the works at looking at targeting pcsk9 pcsk9 Inhibitors as a class of drug have been perhaps the most exciting drug class introduced in the last decade um and the results have lived up to the hype I mean when Helen Hobbs first made the discovery of the individuals that were both hyper and hypofunctioning pcsk9 I I still remember reading those papers 15 years ago thinking this is too good to be true this will not pan out was my that was my dumb prediction this will not pan out um and I was wrong I'm delighted to be wrong um so what does that look like now what does the what does the gene therapy look like to to to go after to silence a gene in this case but without creating some unintended consequence you know it it's going to start out with not just you know the average person who might have a higher risk it's going to start at at the extreme for someone we talked about

[02:15:11] Jesse gilsinger who's going to be willing to be the first in and try this and be that brave first person and so I haven't I won't claim that I've designed the clinical Tri that goes with this but just to say it's going to start uh at that extreme and they going to be a lot of complexities um I I will say and I'm sure many listeners are thinking of this the cost with Gene therapies is prohibitive right now right it's not as if we could if any single gene therapy were $3 million which is not uncommon for current Gene therapies we can't afford to spend $3 million per person uh with the number of people who are at R in the that SMA single gene therapy is about a million treatment so I'll say the range of genetic therapies right now runs between about1 and $3 million so depending on which ones are out there um and it gets complicated sorry just to say one thing about that you know it is worth keeping that in perspective right so I'm not going to sort of advocate one way or the other but it's not uncommon to spend a million dollar on chemotherapy at the end of life for a

[02:16:19] Year's worth of life extension and if you contrast that with a million dooll gene therapy in infancy that gives 80 or 90 years of life extension it at least puts those two treatments in context so I agree with you 100% um Health economists have been trying to get at that in terms of the value um you know we're talking about True Value in terms of this and and I'm not going to pit one against the other in terms of this but you do have to think about and

[02:16:52] I would argue not just the Health Care System cost to the person but it's the societal cost to the family to the community uh you know there's a lot of cost that goes into this if you do the the economic analysis accurately on the other hand um you know to say that that might be worthwhile in one case you do have to think about scaling and I'll just throw out a number for you 10% of the US population has a rare genetic condition they may or may not know it but that's just true in terms of these monogenic factors that we've been talking about so that's 10% of the population if you now think about the you know percentage of the population that's obese or that has obesity or type 2 diabetes or some of these other common conditions that someday might be treated by these one andone types of things then it becomes in terms of a society what can we afford to do what are the competing other healthare costs or other societal costs in general that we have and you know how are we going to rightsize these I I will say that I'm

[02:17:52] I'm confident that um as we have more ability to understand how to do this you know the the there's a lot of fixed cost but the marginal cost is not nearly as high I think you know what I mean by that in terms of you know both what it takes to design the clinical trials to do the manufacturing to do the monitoring you know all of these things uh they won't scale linearly um and so I do think we'll have some cost realization that we can recoup but it's um you know I think those are the big questions that we think about is how are we going to afford this and what are the key things that we need to do to enable doing this on scale um but you know to your point you know what are the competing Alternatives if it is you know a medication that you're taking every day if you can't really get you know to a good point in terms of the um Mi risk or uh anything in terms of heart health or stroke health or other things um so you know I all of those will go into it and eventually a health Economist will price this out and figure out you know what a reasonable fee is to charge for such therapies well you know again just going back to what it costs today on the gene therapy side it still seems like I I don't say this to be disparaging of the field at all because the field is remarkable but I just say it is more of an observation of where we are relative to say Gene sequencing we're still in its infancy aren't we oh absolutely I mean as sad as it is to say given what you said about Jesse Ginger's case was more than 20 years ago we are still at our infancy um in terms of being able to realize all the potential

[02:19:26] I don't even think we have all the Technologies or the vehicles or Delivery Systems that we're going to eventually be effective so so again thinking it through it that way in the year 2000 it cost $1 billion to sequence a human genome today it costs $1,000 so that's a six log reduction in cost um in part through Mo's law in part through the step function change of high throughput sequencing we don't need a six log reduction in the cost of gene therapy to make it readily available you know quite frankly a two log reduction would make this a game

[02:20:12] Cher does that strike you as something that's feasible in the next two decades so I I would say yes there are going to be certain catalytic transformative breakthroughs that will make and enable those changes that you're talking about so again I'll go back to what we did with the covid vaccines right those were you know it was incumbent upon everyone to be able to come up with Solutions and the solutions that allowed for the adaptability and even changing the vaccine on the

[02:20:43] Fly were remarkable to me at least from a scientific point of view and I know some people may push back on me but I that is my true Bel belief if you could think about the same way with delivering an mRNA vaccine and doing the same thing and realize that it's different for genetic Gene addition in doing it but it's not entirely different in terms of how to do this and so as you're talking about um I call it rinse and repeat but it's being able to do this and having the infrastructure the delivery system the regulatory system the manufacturing process all of those things once you get this and get this down there are ways to scale this and to be able to you know if the gene fits if it's a certain size if there's certain mutations to be able to do this repeatedly so I do have that hope but there are going to be the the function I think we're going to see I call it a step function right so you're going to see it's not going to be linear it's not going to be right so that's what we'll see so last year I read

[02:21:38] Walter isaacson's biography of Jennifer DNA and the story of the discovery of crisper and um I thought it was a fantastic book I can't recommend it highly enough to people who are listening or watching I'm sure you've read it um um but there was there was a fantastic discussion of the ethics of this and once you realize the power of

[02:22:00] Gene editing you very quickly start to Pivot away from the discussion we're having today which is a child is born with tasa disease this child is going to be dead in a couple of years and it's a very ugly death there's really nobody in their right mind that wouldn't be in favor of a therapy there we could go through all the examples we've talked about and there's nobody I can imagine that's going to say if a woman is born with a Brack mutation and she has the choice between a gene edit to fix it or a mastectomy to remove her breast we'd probably prefer the former if for no other reason then it ends the gene there and her daughter won't get it or her son won't get it

[02:22:48] Etc what do what do you think H how can people think about the next layer of complexity which is well should we be able to take a person who has an apoe4 isopor and turn that into an APO E3 isopor or an apoe2 isopor which would actually come with significant protection against neurodegenerative disease that's a slightly different case because of course the penetrant and the uh risk profile is different so H how do you as a scientist think about this because I I think that both both eth ethicists and scientists need to be a part of this discussion so

[02:23:32] I agree completely um and it's uh I have to admit so one thing I think we universally agree on I hope is that we're not doing Gene editing Gene manipulation to affect the Next Generation so we're not looking for things that are transmissible in The Germ line we're not trying to create a superhuman where we're trying to you know fiddle with the genes to either correct them or to be able to enhance them was the term that I'll use that's transmissible I think that's a line um scientists would that be true even with something like TX or cystic fibrosis or things like that that's what this consensus among the scientific Community is is that again that you would treat the Soma or the body of the person that might be at risk or have those diseases but you wouldn't try and do manipulations that would be transmissible to the Next Generation I see so my argument for braa is only partially correct I argued that the gene therapy would be favorable because it would spare the woman a masectomy and spare the risk of transmission you're saying no you would only do it in the sematic cells not the germ line she could still transmit that Gene to her daughter that's correct that's the that's the current consensus scientifically um the other part part of it is this tricky thing that you're talking about which is enhancement right in terms of it's not correcting something that's problematic it's enhancing the body the way it is or trying to um in some sense prevent a disease process but you know this I I will say the enhancement once you get to the point of enhancement that's a trigger word for we shouldn't go there and part of this is that we're not as smart as we think we are um you know we can think that something's not going to have off Target Target effects that it's not going to disrupt a gene inadvertently but I think in the short term what saves us is that um the risk profile given the uncertainty in the long term is so high that there aren't going to be either scientists or people

[02:25:34] I think who are going to I hope uh go for things that are trivial in terms of enhancements I'd say that's the first part of this but um to your point in the APO e234 situation I think is one that people think about I also think that although probably the average listener here is more sophisticated about this I think the average person you know walking down Broadway here is not going to think about this in quite the same way and so they're going to think about things that will be enhancements whether it's being able to increase your earning potential being able to be taller more athletic you know funnier you know what there are multiple dimensions in which people would um and people have been surveyed to figure out you know how they would value certain attributes um you know would definitely be thinking about doing that I think at this point it has to be just enhancement as a line that people are I hope not Crossing that it really is about disease and being able to make people healthier as we're doing this um but to the extent that there are certain medical industries that are you know that are not covered by insurance that people that are not regulated there are certain parts of the world that do things differently where people can go and seek certain things um I do hope that there is a consensus scientific typically about places we don't go because otherwise there will be ways to that people will find to do things I mean is it worth just explaining the story of of kind of the initial blowup around crisper and and what took place in China and how um how that brought the scientific community in some ways closer around this consensus sure so the circumstance in China was um something I have to admit was I thought was a little unusual so it was a circumstance uh in which the ccr5 gene was manipulated to try and prevent um children from getting infected with HIV um by manipulating that Gene it's not as if that was curing a disease to your point it's not as if it was uh preventing a disease that was a foregone conclusion it was preventing transmission of infectious agent that those children were at increased risk or it was not a foregone conclusion that they would have been HIV your HIV positive wasn't it also the case that there was very little chance they were going to be because this was an

[02:27:57] IVF uh these were these were children born of IVF and the sperm are washed in that situation and therefore because in this case I believe the father was HIV positive the mother HIV negative um but it was a situation where it was almost entirely possible to prevent the transmission of HIV to The Offspring is that correct right so that that was my my point in terms of I don't think heroic Measures needed to be made to be able to go um there were perfectly I think reasonable ways that uh are very effective not just reasonable but very effective so it was an odd sort of selection of a use case I guess is the point that I'm making scientifically if

[02:28:37] I were going to anyway if I were going to do something I would have done it for this use case but um regardless of that the scientific Community also um you know just I think rallied around that a line had been crossed right that this was essentially a form of enhancement it wasn't something that was saving a life saving a high probability of something for which there were no other treatment anything else and um but but I think you know the other point that I made is true which is that this is the world is global and you know scientists are in all sorts of places and um it only takes one person right to be able to do something that's crossing a line and uh there are people that you know there is tourism Medical touris is M and places and people I've seen go to you know where they feel that there's um something that they think is important that they'll seek and so I think it is important for hopefully people to uphold certain ethical standards and for us to you know have those guiding principles so that people know where those lines are do you think it would have been different if the first use of crisper in humans was to do something that we could all agree on would be a great use case um in other words would be would would the field be in a different place today so so what what year was this that that uh and I'm blanking on the name of the scientist who did this but I know he's been basically if not put in jail certainly put out of science right um I can't recall the year either um but I'm trying to think of what would have been that perfect use case what were you thinking uh Sickle Cell oh let's say took a kid or or or tax for that matter you you took a you took a kid who had a disease that was going to sign ific L impair the quality of their life you used Gene editing to fix the Gene and produce uh phenotype that could have a normal life expectancy um so again same technology but far better application so I think what um most people in the field and this is usually possible is that rather than trying to diddle the genes if you're at the stage of an embryo with inv vitro fertilization you can simply do selection of an embryo that doesn't have that genetic risk and therefore you're not increasing the risk of something off

[02:30:59] Target and you're still accomplishing what it is that you were set out to achieve um I have seen some ethicists make the excuse me make the argument that if there were a very limited number of embryos and that were not possible to do would that be you know a circumstance in which like you said for the purposes of direct therapy for a very bad disease in which that couple had no other alternative in terms of having a biological child would that be possible knowing that that would potenti well would affect the germ line so as opposed to what we were talking about before would be something and that is what I would say is gets Us close to the edge in terms of thinking about that um sort of the use case that you were talking about but not as a matter of routine and not a routine goal in terms of the at least you know intention to do in a universal way yeah it's it's it's incredibly fascinating um if you had a crystal ball you know and you could look into the future in 2040 you know probably you're coming to the end of your career you're thinking about retiring um but you're looking back at a 40 plus year career in this space that has probably seen more transformation than most fields in allive medicine what would you not be surprised to see happening in 2040 in this field so I would not be surprised that diagnosis is Trivial um I do hope we're getting to that point I think there are not just with the cost of sequencing decreasing but with machine learning artificial intelligence the ability to to ingest huge amounts of information genomic information clinical information other information um you know that the the diagnostic ability in medicine in general and I won't say this is limited just to genetics and genomics but is especially true in this field

[02:33:07] Diagnostics will be hopefully trivialized and I hope although I can't I can't guarantee it's going to happen I hope from an equity point of view we'll be more accessible to more people around the world just because that uh cost barrier will decrease what I'm not sure of is on the therapeutic point of view to what we've been talking about how much of that we will have realized within 20 years while I'm optimistic we will have gotten a lot of that done I'm not sure how how much it will penetrate um either parts of society in the United

[02:33:39] States or globally in terms of what we'll be able to do um and this is just I think it's very hard for me to predict timing um and I think Bill Gates has has a quote similar to this you know I do think within some point in the next 100 years we'll get to this point whether it's the next 20 years or not and exactly what percentage of individuals we will have been able to serve I'm not sure um because there are going to be as

[02:34:03] I alluded to these kind of Step functions these transformative things that it's just very hard for me to predict given that I feel like we got stuck um for the last 20 years but I do feel like we're gaining momentum but there's it doesn't take much in society and in science to get us stuck um so I think that's just a word of caution I I would not have predicted I I hate to make things about Co but I would not have predicted in society what's happened in the last 10 years or some of the trajectories we've had so I will uh not use my crystal ball and and I'll say we'll be far much farther ahead but but

[02:34:40] I don't know big confidence interval on where we're going to be in 20 years well Wendy congratulations on your um your new role at um Boston Children's Hospital obviously for folks not aware that's certainly probably one of the three most preeminent children's hospitals in North America um and maybe you would argue the single most uh but but anyway that sounds like a wonderful opportunity I assume you'll be able to stay involved in spark and guardian uh as a pi as those tend to expand so I especially want to thank you for making time on the day that you're literally moving to

[02:35:15] Boston to make time to sit down for so long so congratulations and thank you again very much for your input thanks it's been a lot of fun [Music]
