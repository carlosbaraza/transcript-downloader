## Description

Matt Kaeberlein is globally recognized for his research on the biology of aging and is a previous guest on The Drive. In this episode, Matt defines aging, the relationship between aging, chronic inflammation, and the immune system, and talks extensively about the most exciting molecules for extending lifespan. He discusses the current state of the literature of testing rapamycin (and rapalogs) in animals and humans, including Matt’s Dog Aging Project, and provides insights into how we can improve future trials by conceptualizing risk, choosing better endpoints, and working with regulators to approve such trials. He also examines the connection between aging and periodontal disease, biomarkers of aging, and epigenetic clocks. Finally, they explore some of the biological pathways involved in aging, including mTOR and its complexes, sirtuins, NAD, and NAD precursors.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. Matt Kaeberlein discussing aging biology and interventions:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on the biology of aging, with particular emphasis on rapamycin and mTOR pathway interventions. Dr. Kaeberlein discussed various approaches to understanding aging, from molecular mechanisms to functional declines. Key topics included clinical trials in aging research, the challenges of measuring aging biomarkers, and the potential of various interventions including rapamycin, Torin2, and NAD precursors.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Aging involves multiple hallmarks including DNA damage, cellular senescence, stem cell fatigue, and mitochondrial dysfunction [08:45]
- mTOR exists in two complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) with different functions [1:45:30]
- Rapamycin specifically inhibits mTORC1 but can affect mTORC2 with chronic use [1:47:00]
- Weekly dosing of rapamycin may be as effective as daily dosing with fewer side effects [1:52:15]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider aging as a spectrum of functional decline rather than discrete diseases [15:30]
- Focus on preventing age-related functional declines before disease onset [22:45]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Rapamycin dosing should not begin before age 25 [1:12:30]
- Weekly rather than daily dosing of rapamycin may be optimal [1:53:00]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
Rapamycin:
- Typical dose: 5-8mg weekly [1:15:20]
- Potential benefits for immune function, heart health, and inflammation [1:20:00]
- Side effects appear minimal at lower doses [1:25:30]

NAD Precursors (NR/NMN):
- Safety profile appears good [2:15:30]
- Efficacy remains uncertain [2:16:00]
- Storage stability may be an issue [2:17:00]

**5. Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Current aging biomarkers are limited [2:10:00]
- Epigenetic clocks show promise but have limitations [2:11:30]
- NAD levels can be measured but tissue specificity matters [2:20:00]

**6. Notable Quotes**:
"There is no such thing as a healthy 70-year-old... they're functionally impaired" [1:05:30]

"Age is the single greatest risk factor for every major cause of death and disability in developed countries" [25:45]

**7. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal duration for rapamycin cycling?
2. How can we develop better biomarkers of aging?
3. What role might Torin2 play in future aging interventions?
4. How can regulatory frameworks better accommodate aging-related clinical trials?

This episode provided deep insights into the current state of aging research and interventions, with particular emphasis on the challenges and opportunities in translating research findings into clinical applications.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey matt awesome to uh to have you back on the show it's been a while because you were one of the very very initial and uh original guests on this podcast so i've been looking forward to having you back from almost the moment we finished our first discussion yeah thanks peter it's uh it's great to be back um unfortunately we can't see each other in person but uh but this is the next best thing yeah yeah i know i mean we we we we certainly will and get together in person soon i'm sure um there are so many things i wanted to talk about and and um you know i think last time we spoke we focused mostly on our mutual favor drug rapamycin and our favorite pathway the mtor pathway and and you know certainly for those listening i don't want them to think we're not going to touch on that today we absolutely are but i want to start even broader than that because so often you and i are having these discussions about all things that pertain to aging and uh you know i find you to be one of the most thoughtful people across the topic so i i sort of want to start with these broader questions about aging um a lot of people have different definitions of aging and truthfully i'm not sure i even know how to define aging sometimes i it depends i guess on the context in which i'm asked right i think if my five-year-old asks me about aging i would come up with one answer and if i'm giving a keynote talk and somebody asked me about aging i'd have to give a different one so what are some of the ways that you really describe aging yeah so that's um it's a really good question and i think you know i would probably say the same thing that you just said which is that i'm not sure i have a great answer and it changes depending on the situation i think um in the past i often gravitated towards sort of a molecular definition of aging so you know what are the types of damage that occur during aging what are the consequences of that damage um sort of a you know in some ways a hallmarks of aging framework view right where we we know that things like mitochondrial dysfunction telomere shortening uh cellular senescence things like that happen during aging at the cellular and molecular level and contribute to many of the functional declines and diseases that go along with aging and and so you know given my training in in biochemistry and molecular biology that that sort of is the natural place where i where i go when i think about you know what is aging um i would say you know over the last several years i have developed uh i think a greater appreciation for a functional definition of aging and so i you know as i start to think more and more about translation of interventions that seem to affect the biological aging process um in laboratory animals outside of the laboratory into the clinic you know i spend a lot of time thinking about well what are some of the functional changes that go along with with aging and and we know that across every organ system in the body we see functional declines that go along with aging and so i've started to think more about you know things like frailty uh uh as an important component of defining aging from a biological perspective you know when when we're talking about having an impact on health and longevity so i think it really depends on the context i guess the other thing i would say is both of those definitions and the way i almost exclusively think about aging unless somebody sort of forces me out of out of my box is from a biological perspective there are other aspects of aging that intersect with biological aging right that are probably as as important as what i think of as fundamental biology of aging to quality of life so social aspects of aging for example are extremely important in people especially right for quality of life as you get older i don't tend to gravitate towards you know that kind of a definition of aging but i do recognize that it's important so you know i think i just i'm naturally always thinking about the biology of aging and and as i already said i tend to focus on the molecular mechanisms that drive the biological changes that go along with aging so let's look at the sort of two extreme views within the biologic and then kind of try to figure out where disease fits in so on the one hand you referred to the hallmarks of aging and there's a very famous set of papers that have laid these out and if the day comes that i can actually recite all of them i'll be very impressed but i can i always have to look it up right but i think i can probably get seven yeah yeah it's like so you mentioned who can who can name the most remarkable dna damage is is one of them uh you know cellular senescence is another stem cell fatigue is another uh protein misfolding is another uh telomere shortening uh is another um mitochondrial dysfunction is another my favorite yeah let's see did i mention nutrient sensing issues no different deregulated derivatives yeah so that's my seven what am i forgetting there's intracellular communication bingo uh and what are we missing here i'm gonna be really ashamed if it's if it's something uh that i study yeah but yeah so we've got so you've got this and then at the other side you talked about okay let's talk phenotype let's talk about the outward expression within the organism and frailty is i think a fantastic example where does disease fit into this right because with aging becomes more cancer with aging comes more cardiovascular disease with aging comes more dementia and you could argue that those are functional certain maybe less so cancer but certainly cardiovascular disease and dementia are very functional forms of decline but of course at their root they have a very cellular component and a very strong set of cellular contributions do you think of disease as basically the bridge or the link between these fundamental cellular declines and the ultimate phenotypic declines um no i would not say they're a bridge so i think that i actually i actually personally tend to think almost the the other way around where i think that the functional declines that um often precede overt disease or clinical diagnosis of disease um are are probably as important or more important from a quality of life perspective as we get older and you know this may simply reflect the fact that i'm getting older and and you know i've noticed some of these functional declines in myself right uh and i think that i think these functional declines happen you know as already said in every organ every tissue we don't always recognize them as such unless we sit down and think about and try to you know list out all of the ways that we have changed um as we get older but i think and those often happen far before you get diagnosed with any age-related disease right so i'm pretty fortunate i turned 50 in february i don't have any age-related disease at least that i've been diagnosed with yet i have a multitude of functional declines which which you know fortunately don't impact me severely but that i recognize i'm not i'm functionally impaired to where i was 25 years ago i think we you know it's just a fact any 50 year old is and so i kind of think of those as the first sort of uh things that you can observe that happen during aging often way before you get an age-related disease the other thing i would say about disease so there's actually two things two points i want to make one is i think it depends on the disease but we really don't have a good understanding of when the pathology of the disease is no longer normative aging and what i mean by that is you know we've got some understanding of the molecular cellular mechanisms that drive biological aging that contribute in some way to our risk of developing alzheimer's disease cardiovascular disease you know sort of all of the age-related diseases that that are major causes of death and disability but in most of those cases you know there comes a point where the the pathology of the disease is not necessarily at a molecular mechanistic level an extension of aging biology it becomes something different and and i think that's really important to recognize because one of the implications of that is that an intervention that affects biological aging let's just say rapamycin we can discuss whether rapamycin is really affects biological aging in people i think that's still a little bit of an open question let's just say for the sake of argument that it does it's not clear that that same intervention is going to be effective once a pathology you know progresses to the point that it's not the same mechanism anymore so i think that that's a really important point that sometimes gets lost in this discussion of aging and disease so let's let's actually double click on that using okay a disease so um you want to pick one of the big three atherosclerosis cancer dementia i think cancer is a really is a really good example right so we know mtor which and i'll go back to rapamycin in part because you know it's again something i think a lot about but it actually it's a really good i think example in this specific case because we know that mtor which is the the the target of rapamycin right the protein that rapamycin inhibits plays this fundamental role in regulating cell division and cell cycle right so if you inhibit in a non-cancerous cell if you inhibit mtor enough you will stop the cell cycle the cell will stop dividing right but there are mutations that can happen that lead to cancer that cause the cell to no longer pay attention to the mtor break right and so once that's happened if that's the type of cancer you have that no longer responds to mtor inhibition rapamycin won't do anything to cell cycle and that in that case so that's a really i think specific example that you can point to there are you know sort of an infinite number of other examples that we could use but that's a really nice one because there rapamycin will be quite effective at preventing cancer before that mutation happens but after that mutation happens and the cell's not responding to rapamycin anymore because it doesn't sense the mtor break it's completely ineffective right so that that i think is a is a case where the mechanisms have changed right the the mechanisms that are important for preventing cancer before that mutation occurred are different from the mechanisms that might deal with that cancer after that mutation has occurred yeah it's funny this is a little off topic but i've often contemplated this question in the context of nutrition because in as much as there's an optimal nutrition to prevent a condition it might not be the same as the optimal nutritional strategy to treat the disease once it's present and you know an example of that in an extreme sense might be a ketogenic diet i happen to believe a ketogenic diet is probably the best treatment for someone with type 2 diabetes because of course type 2 diabetes by its very definition is a carbohydrate intolerance disorder so once a person has it you pull out the carbohydrates completely and you let them heal right you basically let them recover and regain their ability you know and again we've seen that people who have been on a ketogenic diet for a long enough period of time can resume some amount of carbohydrate consumption provided their other factors are changing such as exercise does that mean one needs to be on a ketogenic diet to prevent diabetes no i don't think so so it's a little bit of the same idea though it's still something that's unclear you know one thing i want to go back to on the disease front is and i believe it was cynthia kenyon who who spoke about this once uh i think i read it in a paper something to the effect of you know using a disease-based definition for aging is she didn't use the word tautology but she effectively said it is a bit of a tautology because at what point is a disease a disease it's only a disease when some people have it and some people don't right if if you if everybody has cancer by a certain age then it's normative aging to your point it's no longer a disease um and then we get into well what does it mean that some like why do you know point zero zero zero four percent of the population live to be a hundred they've managed to not succumb to a disease by a hundred by the age of a hundred and what does that tell us about their normative aging versus everybody else all of this is to say i literally still don't think i understand what aging is which is unfortunate given my line of work well i mean i think we i think we have to we have to uh just accept that it's extremely complicated right and and so you're never i shouldn't say never i don't think i will ever understand aging fully and i don't think the field will at least you know in any time frame that i can expect to experience right but i i also believe that we don't have to understand it fully to be able to have an impact on the biology of aging through interventions and so i think that and that's kind of where i'm at i feel like i've got a conceptual flavor for what aging is and i have a some information about what the molecular mechanisms are and it's enough information that that that i can come up with rational approaches to target those mechanisms with the prediction that those approaches should have an impact on health and longevity as animals and people get all get older and then we have to test those predictions right that that that i think is um that's kind of the way i i think about it i do want to come back to one point though which i also think is often um underappreciated but in this relationship between disease and the biology of aging i think you know sometimes people get into this debate about whether or not the biology of aging causes diseases of aging right so does the biology of aging cause alzheimer's disease cancer cardiovascular disease right um people get in debates about that and i personally think the data are pretty good that these what i think of is the biology of aging the molecular mechanisms the hallmarks whatever you want to call them contribute in a causal way to your risk of developing diseases but i also think it doesn't matter it does and this i think is really important from the perspective of what is the best strategy to keep people healthier longer it just doesn't matter whether aging causes disease or it creates a permissive physiological state for disease you can't argue that biological age is the single greatest risk factor for every major cause of death and disability in developed countries that is just a fact and whether or not biological age causes those diseases or creates a physiological state that allows those diseases to manifest themselves doesn't matter from the perspective of how what is the most effective way to prevent those diseases and i think that's where this debate is counterproductive right should we call aging a disease does aging cause disease i think that those are those are not the right questions to be asking in my view yeah let me see if you would agree with my assessment i think you would but uh i'll tell you how i think about this problem clinically right so um let's use atherosclerosis as an example and i want to highlight what you just said in case the the the person watching this or listening to this missed it in any way shape or form there is no gran this is one of the questions i when i used to give talks this is i'd always lead with a question like this what is the greatest risk factor for atherosclerosis handle go up yes smoking no hand will go up high blood pressure no hand will go up if it's an especially you know erudite audience uh apob or ldlc nope and they'll just keep rattling inflammation nope nope nope nope nope nope the number one thing is age hands down right you take a 70 year old person who has everything perfect about them and you compare them to a 20 year old train wreck who has not a single thing that is in their favor there is no comparison about their 10-year mortality prediction the 70 year old is in hands down a worse shape so yeah you can't you can't undo that now here's how i think about this problem clinically atherosclerosis is a great example because it's the disease that we understand the most of the big three right which is not to say we understand it completely but we have a far better understanding of what its drivers are and how to prevent it than we do cancer and alzheimer's disease lowering apob pharmacologically nutritionally etc is arguably the most important strategy you have to reduce it along with probably improving metabolic health so those two things right so regulating glucose insulin lowering apob all of these things can be done through lifestyle through drugs etc can dramatically reduce a person's risk of atherosclerosis none of those things are necessarily directly directly targeting the nine hallmarks of aging i think indirectly they certainly do but when you give somebody a pcsk9 inhibitor which specifically targets a protein that allows the body to clear more apob particles out of circulation it is by no means targeting one of those nine pillars but it's having a measurable impact on reducing their risk of disease and in the end that's the part that i think is hard for some people to understand within the aging community is that you can still target metrics of a disease specifically without going after a hallmark sure and i i mean i think um i i don't disagree with you that that i think that is a it's a concept that sometimes is is uh underappreciated right especially within the aging community um i also think it you know it's not it makes sense right so even if the hallmarks or you know i has we focus so much on the hallmarks because it's easy right i think there are some reasons why the hallmarks are incomplete but but let's just keep using that that term uh sort of as a surrogate for the molecular mechanisms of aging right if we accept that the hallmarks are at some level you know preceding the damage whatever that is that's causing the disease it makes sense that you could intervene sort of if we think about it in an upstream downstream perspective right the hallmarks being upstream the disease being ultimately downstream it makes sense that you could intervene at the level of the hallmarks it also makes sense that you could intervene you know whatever the bridge is that's connecting the hallmarks to the disease you wouldn't necessarily impact the biology of aging at all and this gets back to what i was talking about before which in for many diseases of aging there comes a point where the pathology of the disease is not normative aging anymore and so you can you can quite successfully treat or cure a disease of aging in an individual uh without impacting the biology of aging in fact i would argue that's almost exclusively what is done clinically right is is to to try to to either alleviate the symptoms of the disease uh or cure the disease they're starting to be more on the preventative side but i still think that lags far behind you know waiting until people are sick and then trying to do something about their disease but but you don't have to impact the biology of aging to be successful at at any of those things i would just argue that impacting the biology of aging is going to be a much more effective and efficient approach from sort of the overall health perspective i think the other point that's obvi obvious but is important to make is if you don't target the biology of aging that you're really only impacting that one disease say it's cancer you can cure somebody's cancer you can take the tumor out right and and they can go on and live a normal life but you haven't done anything to the biology of aging um if you if you don't confront the biology of aging right you still have all of these other functional declines and diseases of aging that are that are increasing you know essentially exponentially as you're getting older and so the effect on health and longevity is quite small in fact i think jl shansky was the person who originally kind of did the math here right and it's really very striking so if you consider a typical 50 year old woman in the united states and you say you know what would happen if we had a cure to all cancers right every type of cancer we had a cure today and we implemented that life expectancy for a typical 50 year old woman in the in the united states would go up about three years that's it so we've won the war on cancer we get a plus three on life expectancy it's about the same for curing heart disease if you cure both of those diseases it's roughly additive it's i think about seven years so the impact on life expectancy is actually from from curing disease is actually quite small if you compare that to the impact of targeting biological aging which which again i think we have to be honest right this is hypothetical in humans at this point so all we can really do is extrapolate from what is done in laboratory animals but it's pretty routine now there are i don't know maybe a dozen 15 different interventions that can increase life span slow aging and mice by between 15 and 30 percent if we com if we just extrapolate that to the human condition the impact on life expectancy is about 20 years with the added value that because you've sort of slowed all of the functional declines of aging simultaneously those extra couple of decades are spent in relatively good health right so i think i think it's just important to appreciate the um the the potential difference in health and life expectancy from targeting aging as opposed to what we what we do right now which is you know trying to cure individual diseases and i've sort of adopted the the term you know i think of that as 20th century medicine the disease first approach or i would even say 19th century medicine we've been doing this for a long time right um and i and i contrast that to what i think of as 21st century medicine which is which is approaching health and longevity from the perspective of the biology of aging and i we're not there yet right but i do believe that that this is happening there is a there is a transition occurring a slow appreciation among the broader clinical community of the potential of this kind of approach and i do believe that we will get there in this century so so it is my hope and expectation that 21st century medicine will really become targeting the biology of aging to enhance health and longevity hopefully by much much greater amount than than we're currently able to do yeah so i agree with a lot of that the one thing i would i would throw through a little bit of a question at is and i'd love to have jay on the podcast because i don't know that i fully agree with his analysis i agree with the spirit of his analysis so i completely agree that disease-based whack-a-mole is not as go it's not going to be nearly as effective as targeting the basic biology of aging yeah so completely agree with with your points i don't know that i agree with the magnitude right the de minimis magnitude of it because i i really think that jay's analysis is focused on an independent look at each disease whereas in reality if you eliminated cardiovascular disease by definition you have reduced inflammation significantly you've reduced the burden of microvascular disease significantly those are going to play into other diseases so yeah you know the his analysis is very actuarial but it's not actually very biological that's my opinion now again i should have i think that's fair yeah i i think that's fair i think you could make the case at least for for cancer that it may be closer to just what the straight you know math would suggest yeah yeah now with all of that said i couldn't agree more with the macro point here which is delaying chronic disease um is probably not going to be as effective as targeting something at the foundation now that said let's let's let's take a look at near's data right so when you look at near barzillai's work with centenarians the overwhelming statement here is they get chronic diseases later they don't live longer with them and i remember you know really being struck by that it was not my necessarily my you know that would not have been my null hypothesis going into near's you know a study of near's work and tom pearls as well between near and tom you really have the greatest assessment of the centenarians and their siblings yeah and you realize that like they don't seem to have magical protection from a disease once they get it when they get cancer they're just as hosed as the rest of us when they get heart disease they're just they're just as bad off as the rest of us but they get a phase shift they get a 20-year 20 sometimes 30-year phase shift in when they're going to get the disease and so how does that factor into my thinking clinically my factoring to that clinically is the sooner you begin prevention the more you can mimic the centenarian what we don't fully understand is molecularly why is that the case right we've identified some of their genes right we know that you know they're going to be more likely to you know have apo e2 versus apoe3 or apoe4 they're going to be you know more less likely to have 80c3 high regulation versus low i mean there's you know you have a lot of genes that produce phenotypes that are favorable but when you bring it back to our nine hallmarks by the way the ninth hallmark is epigenetic uh module yes it's like epigenetic modulation now the other point i guess that we're both well aware of but maybe for the listener is how difficult it is to study aging in humans targeting the basic biology because you don't get to do what our clinical trials apparatus is set up to do which is pick a disease a very clear endpoint and target it if your endpoint is nutrient sensing that's a tough clinical trial yeah so so i agree and i think i think you know we should definitely come back to that point because it's it's it's clearly uh a major focus of the field right now is how do we how do we start to test some of these interventions that we know work in laboratory animals in the clinic that's that's a challenge i want to come back to your comment about about centenarians though because i think this again is a it's a conceptual area where there's a lot of um i think misunderstanding uh both among people in the field and also uh uh lay people who pay attention to the to the field um so that so so you're right i think that the bulk of the evidence supports the idea that centenarians um do not live longer with multiple age-related diseases but they have um genetic risk factors or genetic variants that put them at lower risk at least for the major killers so there is a genetic component to being a centenarian it's not huge but it's significant probably somewhere i think around 25 30 percent and they they tend to not have the high risk genetic variants for alzheimer's disease you know certain types of cancer heart disease things like that and then there's a luck or environment or something else we don't understand right that comes into play but people often look at that observation and make the assumption that we don't see variants and things like mtor or sirtuins not that there aren't variants that haven't been talked about but that have strong effects right so so i think the the uh question becomes why don't we see variants in you know cert six or mtor or pick your favorite longevity gene foxo right that cause people to live to be 180 years old because we can do that magnitude of lifespan extension in a mouse or a c elegans right um and so they they go from that so that's a that's an observation we haven't found those variants yet uh although foxo is one of the genes uh foxo3a no that's not your way it's a very weak effect but it's it's clearly a higher amount right and as is mtor there's evidence for all of those things you can find genetic evidence but the effects are relatively small um so then the the so then but then the interpretation that people make is the reason we don't see those variants is because humans are fundamentally different from mice or whatever your favorite laboratory organism is and none of those things will work the same way in people now i can't prove that they will work the same way yet for aging and people but that's a that's a a a an ill that's not a logical sort of interpretation right i would argue the reason you don't see strong effect variants in mtor for example in people is because we know that strong effect variants in mtor are incompatible with life and development even in mice right you make a mtor knockout mouse it's dead it's you know so so i think the reason why you don't see these strong effect variants in people is because there is such a strong selective pressure either either they don't make it through gestation they don't make it through development or they're sterile right all of those are incompatible with with evolutionary success and and that's my hypothesis for why we don't see these very strong effect genetic variants in people that lead to 160 170 year life spans again it's a hypothesis right it's hard to it's hard to to know what the explanation is but it certainly fits with what we see in laboratory animals any of these any of these uh mutants in mice that have you know 30 40 percent lifespan extension i mean they are all significantly uh defective in in from from an evolutionary perspective right they would not be selectively advantageous mutations and so i think that's that's at least a consistent explanation for why we don't see these these these um what we would think of as slower aging variants pop up in in people um the other point that's that's important to make as well though is that that doesn't mean that we can't intervene in these pathways to have an impact on health and longevity and for me this has been you know probably the most uh exciting aspect and development in the field over the last probably 15 years you know if you asked me 15 years ago whether i thought that it would be easy to slow aging in an old mouse i would have said no i would have said you probably have to start you know at 6 months of age and treat them all the way through life to get to get the benefits and that was honestly largely based on caloric restriction right which that seems to be the case for caloric restriction you know what has emerged now is there are five or six or seven or maybe even more different interventions that can be initiated in middle age or even in late age in mice and you actually go it's not only that you slow down the declines you actually reverse the declines right and again i come back to rapamycin because in pretty much every tissue where this has been looked at you take an old mouse you give it rapamycin functionally it's younger in that tissue or that organ and lifespan is extended and by the way to your point matt i was having dinner with a friend last night who asked me why don't we start giving rapamycin to children and i said look i think i think rapamycin is is the most important you know geroprotective agent out there today but you wouldn't want to give it to a developing uh child right he so he said if you had to guess when would be the right age to start i said i have no honest clue but it wouldn't be before 25 right it just wouldn't be before about the age of 25 which speaks to your point any genetic uh manipulation or in this case naturally acquired genetic variation that mimicked rapamycin would probably not be selective because you wouldn't be able to turn it on and off the way you would need to with the drug that's right yeah that's right and i mean i think that's a really interesting question about rapamycin and other interventions as as as more and more interventions start to you know get to the same sort of level of confidence that we have about rapamycin um when is the optimal sort of treatment period right to get the biggest benefits and i think again this is a it's it's it it's not something that often gets i think talked about in that conversation but it's really a it's a balancing act right there any intervention is going to have some risk associated with it right the risk can be low the risk can be high but there's always some risk of side effects and um and so the the the question of optimal treatment right is a balance between the beneficial effects that you get and the risk of detrimental effects side effects and so i think we still don't even with rapamycin we still don't have a great feel for what that risk looks like right and that's in part because you know we haven't had long-term controlled clinical trials at multiple doses multiple strategies of you know intermittent versus continuous treatment things like that so we just don't know right and it's it's interesting in the case of rapamycin because my impression is that you know there are a group of people um i think you and i both know some of them uh we might even be among them who uh who you know have self-experimented right and my impression is that the the the the um there has been a movement towards the idea that you know once a week dosing with rapamycin uh is probably better than daily dosing with rapamycin for for aging effects in people and that you know you might want to do it for three months and then you stop for six months and you do it again for three months right i think that's where that's where people are starting to coalesce around this idea there's not a lot of data to support that right it's a guess and and so um so it's just interesting to sort of see how that you know is evolving in the absence of long-term large-scale controlled clinical trials and this is getting to the point that you raised earlier which is it's really hard and expensive to do long-term controlled clinical trials for aging in people we really i think still as a field don't have a great strategy for how to for how to address that challenge of of of actually trying to answer some of these questions in the way that you know at least traditionally we would want to see them answered in a clinical setting i mean i think there's an even bigger problem matt which is i don't think there's a regulatory appetite to even do what what what would be necessary because we have the regulatory appetite to say you take an individual who is either at very high risk for a disease or already has said disease and we will go ahead and accept the risk of a clinical trial to assess it but by definition if you truly want to understand how geroprotective metformin or rapamycin or canagaflazzin or pick your favorite molecule is you really need to be testing it in people before they have a disease so even if you so there's really two fundamental problems this is one we do not have a regulatory environment that accepts that risk so i i would love to see the irb submission that says we're going to test rapamycin in healthy 50 year olds who are you know whose 10-year risk of death is less than one percent yeah and then secondly because we can't logistically follow those people for the next 50 years which is what would be necessary to understand its true magnitude of gero protection we would need really good biomarkers of aging of which i will pause it and you may disagree we have somewhere between zero and epsilon of those i mean we don't have diddly squat in the way of meaningful biomarkers of aging by the way i want to go back to your point on rapa so so you know as as you do know and i'm very happy to talk about i mean i've been taking rapamycin for two and a half years now and i am one of those people who has coalesced around once weekly dosing i have fiddled a little bit with my dose i've varied it from as little as five to as many as eight milligrams once a week i've also done the cycling on and the cycling off but i am completely flying blind um most of my dosing and frequency data comes from joan manik and lloyd klixteen's 2014 paper with avarolamis which of course is not the same as rapamycin but it's a pretty reasonable hand-drawn facsimile of it and it was from that study that i concluded that you know 20 milligrams versus five milligrams versus one milligram your sweet spot was at about five rel from a side effect standpoint and an efficacy standpoint and the daily dose of one milligram didn't seem to produce as good an effect as the five milligrams once a week but how does that stand in comparison to what we learned from all of the itp studies where it's continuous administration of rapamycin and to your point because we'll come back to these and talk about them remarkable results regardless of when it's initiated right i don't know what to make of that i mean yeah and and you know i i i kind of agree with everything you said about about why you know if you're gonna pick one regimen for rapamycin that makes sense and and and like you said it's really based on two clinical trials right i mean really uh and so it's a limited data set but at least for immune function in people um you know it seemed to work and and that's actually i mean you know we could we could spend hours talking about this because that's a whole nother i think uh interesting and informative sort of experience was was the the failure of the phase three clinical trial at restore bio right and and what happened there and i don't think we actually it's at least not in the it's not published yet well let's talk about this because it is really interesting so let's back up for a moment and give people the context so um when joan was at novartis in and both john and lloyd were at novartis in 2014 the everlima study was done and um do you want to just tell people really briefly what that study looked at right so so that study so everolimus is a derivative of rapamycin and and biochemically it has exactly the same mechanism so it's i at least i conceptually think about them as essentially the same molecule so so anything that we see with ever alignments we would expect to see with rapamycin and so that was a phase two clinical trial in healthy older adults to look at whether or not a six-week uh treatment with everelymus could boost uh vaccine response so so the ability of older adults to respond to an influenza vaccine and that actually was based on one of my favorite papers from panjang's lab at the university of michigan who showed that in mice uh i think it was i think it was four weeks of rapamycin it was either four weeks or six weeks of rapamycin and old mice boosted the ability of a flu vaccine to to protect those mice against a lethal dose of influenza that if anybody hasn't hasn't looked at that paper i i would just encourage you to go check it out i think it was a 2009 science signaling paper from panjang's lab uh something the title has something about hematopoietic stem cells and rapamycin we'll link to it in the show notes for sure okay yeah it's an amazing study but but my favorite experiment there was this experiment where they took young and old mice and they gave them a influenza vaccine and then they waited uh two weeks and then they gave them a leth what would be a lethal dose of influenza if they hadn't got the vaccine and in the old group half the mice either got rapamycin or they got a control right so the first thing that struck me about that experiment was if you look at just the difference between young and old mice who got the vaccine all of the young mice were protected 100 vaccine response i think it was about 65 so two-thirds of the old mice did not have a sufficient response to the vaccine that they were protected against influenza right and i don't know if the numbers are i don't think the numbers are exactly the same in people but there is definitely that same trend where older adults tend to not respond to vaccines as effect as robustly as younger adults unless those old mice got rapamycin if they got six weeks of rapamycin uh they were a hundred percent effective at responding to the vaccine so at least for that measure of immune function rapamycin fully restored the immune system back to that of a youthful immune system so that was the mouse data that sort of served as um support for testing this in humans in this clinical trial that we're about to get to and by the way matt do you recall if the immune response in in question i.e the immune response that was better in the rapa group versus the non-rapid group of older mice was this a b cell response a memory b cell response or was it a t cell response i you know i i don't recall the data i know they have a lot of data in there looking at uh at the the antibody titers and different uh types of immune cell types and and how they responded as i said the title of that paper and the the model that they proposed was that rapamycin was acting at the level of hematopoietic stem cells to rejuvenate hematopoietic stem cell function in some way i don't recall the details of the immunology and you know i've i've tried multiple times throughout my career to become fluent in um immunologists speak and have failed miserably every time so that's a weakness of mine that will likely never be uh never be addressed adequately it's just got such amazing implications for what we're seeing with with covet vaccination because we are still in such a nascent stage of truly understanding i mean you know we're seeing people who you know naturally acquired kovid who within six months have no more circulating igg and we have no clue if they still have immune function for example do they still have memory b cells in their bone marrow that when challenged will make antibodies do they still produce do they still have memory t cells that will show up and immediately respond and and you know so we're actually involved in a study that's looking at that but my my intuition is you can probably still have an immune response uh or an immune response that's ready to go absint circulating igg yeah the one thing i will say about rapamycin and everelimus is that it it it seems like it's not one simple mechanism at play so joan for example has has published data that one of the effects of everolimus and another drug called rtb 101 which is also an mtor inhibitor is to boost antiviral gene expression right so so it and we know also that that rapamycin at least in mice and almost certainly in people tamps down on the sort of you know chronic sterile inflammation that goes along with aging through mechanisms that still are being worked out so i think it's probably multiple things that are going on that can impact immune function in different ways right uh when you when you treat with rapamycin especially in the context of an old animal or an old person so it's probably not going to be one one mechanism is my guess so based on this study so joan and colleagues take a group of i believe 65 year olds i think they're you know 80 320 of them so divided into four groups of 80 you've got a placebo group one milligram a week group 20 milligrams once a week and five milligrams once a week yeah that's right yeah and so they did a six i think it was a six week treatment period uh and then they also waited i think two weeks and then they gave them a flu vaccine and and what they showed i mean obviously it's people so you can't do the mouse experiment and then give those people a lethal dose of influenza so they were sort of you know stuck with looking at things like antibody titers and to to try to get an assessment of you know did the people who got um ever alignments respond better to the vaccine than the people who got the vehicle control and it looked like they did and it was you know you can argue about the the strength of the data i think it was pretty clear that they had um at least at the the the five mig once a week and i think the one mig daily i can't remember maybe it was the 20 mig once a week but the five meg once a week looked pretty convincing that they had a better response to the to the vaccine i think the other thing that's really important about that paper is that the incidence of side effects was really hardly different at all between the the different everolimus groups and the placebo and particularly the five mig once a week there really was no significant increase in adverse events in that group which gets back to how we kind of started on this this tangent which is that that's part of the reason why you know i think people are moving towards the idea that you can still get efficacy from once weekly dosing and that the side effects are reduced at once weekly dosing to essentially zero or close to zero so that was the first phase two trial and then they went on and before we leave this trial matt i i think it is important for someone listening to understand why people like you and i and dave sabatini and all the people who live in mtor land i'm not putting myself in the same category as you guys but you know what i mean i'm an mtor fanboy um why was that such an interesting and landmark paper well i think it's because up until that point the only human application for rapamycin was immune suppression right that's right rapamycin is a drug i have known about forever because as a surgical resident i was giving rapamycin to kidney transplant patients heart transplant patients and liver transplant patients along with a cocktail of cyclosporine you know prednisone mmf all of these other really nasty drugs and it was one part of that in their ability to suppress the immune system so i think prior to that paper you have you have the itp that the first itp that came out in 09 suggesting this is a remarkable tool for longevity at least in the itp mice but then on the other hand you're saying wow but it can't really work in humans because it's going to be really horrible to the immune system so you had this sort of dialectical dilemma which all of a sudden it became well maybe that's not the case so so how do you reconcile the the the data that we saw in jones paper with the fact that rapamycin is um at least in theory an immune suppressor as it pertains to organ transplantation yeah and i think you know you're absolutely right that was one important aspect of that that paper um and i unfortunately think that that the the old view which in my room is the wrong view that rapamycin is an immunosuppressant um still is prevalent in the clinical community i think most clinicians still think of rapamycin and rapidlogs as as as immune suppressants because that's often how they're used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection my um so so i think the simple answer is it's all about dose dummy i mean we we know every drug has a dose response right and that you can get different effects different outcomes different side effects depending on the dose and so you know when you back off on the dose of rapamycin or everolimus um in the context of an aged physiology so there's there's you know there's multiple things going on here in that study they used lower doses they tested once weekly dosing and these are old people who show a functional decline you're not going to see a functional improvement in vaccine response if you did this experiment in young people right you're only going to see it in the context of of older people where they already have a functional deficit and that's again it's an important conceptual point that i think often gets lost in these discussions um the other thing to appreciate about how rapamycin has been used you know traditionally and how it was first approved is these are people who had an organ transplant right taking high doses of the drug and also i think always i'm not an organ transplant position but my impression is these people are always taking other immune suppressants in combination with mtor inhibitors so in that context yes it does seem to be the case that mtor inhibitors can help reduce the chance of of organ rejection in transplant patients i don't i could be wrong i think there's i think there's preclinical data i don't know of any strong clinical data that by itself rapamycin even at higher doses has substantial immune suppressing effects it might it wouldn't shock me if it does at high doses but i don't know that that's really ever been been shown clearly in healthy people you know taking higher doses of the drug yeah that's interesting i don't think i've ever gone back and looked at the fda approval process in 99 because obviously it was approved approved for that use and i think that's the only use that it's been approved for um so i wonder what trials led to that approval uh you know whatever trials would have taken place in the mid 90s yeah i don't i don't recall another point that i think is worth making is you know we use and i i'm as guilty of this as anybody else we use um sort of broad terms when we're talking about the immune system suppression you know lower function we say the immune system you know doesn't function as well in older people as compared to younger people which is true but i think when we say doesn't function as well we tend to think of as it's functioning at a lower level right there's just less activation which actually isn't necessarily the case in old mice in old people there's a lot of immune activation that shouldn't be happening right there's a lot of sterile inflammation that's occurring so it's not necessarily that the immune system is is functioning less it's functioning inappropriately and and i think there's a ton of evidence that that many of the benefits that we see in mice from rapamycin occur because it tamps down on that sort of sterile inflammation that goes along with aging right the inappropriate activation of the immune system so in that sense you could think of it as an immune suppressant but but through mechanisms that i don't understand at all and i don't think anybody really understands um it seems to be more effective at targeting the bad the bad part of the aberrant immune response in an aged physiology which might be the reason why you're able to then have more of the good part and here i'm you know clearly showing my ignorance of immunology because i'm referring to it as bad and good right but i think in some ways that's it's useful to kind of think about it at that level because it's easier to appreciate that it's not you know not immune function isn't intrinsically good or bad right it it is and there are different types of immune responses and if you get the the wrong type of the immune immune response at the wrong time that's bad if you get the right type of immune response when you need it that's good right and and and i think in in the context of aging we just see a lot more of the bad and probably a decline in function of the good and and i don't know if rapamycin is affecting both of those but i think it's definitely affecting the bad and bringing it back down which might just be enough to allow the good to come back up where it's supposed to yeah which you know look i think that's a great point to make and it's very similar with reactive oxygen species right i mean you have to have them they are vital signaling molecules and yet if they run amok they cause damage and so yeah yeah a lot of biology is is in the goldilocks framework of not too much not too little yeah can i just throw one more thing out there as well which is and this is this is again i'll admit if you'd asked me 15 years ago like how important did i think that you know chronic inflammation and immune function would be an aging i probably would have said you know i don't know but my guess is it's not going to be the major player right because you know my background came from working in yeast and worms which you know worms sort of have an immune system but not really right i would have pointed to things like translation and autophagy and mitochondria all of which are clearly important for affecting inflammation and immune function but i i wasn't a bit i wasn't really bullish on inflammation at that point and i have become very bullish on inflammation as you know critically important for many of the the functional declines and diseases of aging that we see in people the point that i want to make here is that maybe maybe i shouldn't say every all of the interventions that i know about that that i'm enthusiastic about translationally seem to hit inflammation in mice and they seem to tamp down on you know the chronic sterile inflammatory signaling that we see go along with aging which makes sense it's encouraging right that that they all seem to have this shared mechanism but the other the flip side of that is i'm i'm you know people talk a lot about their people are very excited now about you know analytics or reprogramming now is the new the news analytics right it's the thing everybody's excited about i'm not sure that those are fundamentally different from rapamycin in terms of the way that they're working and and i think we obviously we need to find out because you know it would be nice to know whether combinations of these interventions are going to do better than one alone but but to me the underlying theme that seems to be similar about all of these things that work in mice is if you look in tissues of aged mice at you know inflammatory cytokines p16 p21 markers of senescence they seem to be tamped down by all of these these interventions which might explain the functional improvements that we see uh from from using these interventions in age mice yeah i i think that's actually a really interesting point and i i would kind of say i'm in the same boat i have become probably more convinced at the importance of inflammation certainly in alzheimer's disease and certainly in atherosclerosis because i've seen enough people who [Music] either develop these conditions without otherwise clear reasons for it and vice versa right people who do have other risk factors and don't go on to develop um but have you know at least have a demonstrably low measured amount of of inflammation again the question becomes do you target is there a direct target of inflammation or do you simply reduce inflammation by targeting these other mechanisms which we'll we'll get to um let's go back to the everolimus progression you were just about to talk about rtb 101. so what what is that and how is that the next stage in the evolution of this wrapalog right so so there was the the the first phase two trial was was done they hit their end point it looked like it worked and they didn't see any i mean this was a phase two trial so so the important thing was they didn't really see any substantial adverse effects as well right so then for the next trial they added in another drug called rtb 101 which is um uh one of these drugs that hits multiple kinases uh in the cell so mtor is a kinase which you know means that the biochemical activity is is to put phosphate groups on other proteins but you can think of it as a signaling sort of activity right so it mtor senses the environment and regulates the output based on the signaling function of being a kinase this drug rtb 101 inhibits mtor the catalytic activity of mtor it also inhibits other kinases so so it's talked about as sort of a dual kinase inhibitor but in reality it hits multiple kinases so it's a dirtier drug that's that's maybe the way to the point to make it's a dirtier drug than rapamycin which has a very specific biochemical effect on mtor and mtorc1 specifically which we haven't we haven't dove into the m torque one versus m torque two situation and was the rationale for using a dirtier drug simply to create a new drug to have a molecule that is novel and therefore protectable by ip or was it designed to be dirtier without thinking of it as being dirtier but thinking of it as being sort of uh pluripotent across several kinases yeah so i wasn't i obviously wasn't involved in designing this trial so i can't i can't answer that question as to what the what exactly their thought process was i think it is true that rtb 101 has a had had and has a longer existing patent life than ever alignment so there is that component certainly to to moving a drug through the approval process and if you talk to joan um uh she will tell you that they had uh unpublished data that rtb 101 at the doses that they were using in this trial um appears to be specific for mtor complex one like rapamycin so i think their thought process i mean in reality it was probably twofold right the ip life was greater and and there's a biological rationale for testing rtb 101 either alone or in combination with ever alignment and so that was really the design of the phase two trial was um one r it was it was uh structurally very similar to the to the first phase ii trial right so you have older adults same sort of age range i think they had to be 65 they couldn't have a pre-existing age-related condition significant age-related condition they had a control placebo arm everelimus alone rtb 101 alone and both and and i'll be honest with you i don't remember the dosing on the rtb 101 um and so they looked at vaccine response and then they also looked at in this study upper respiratory tract infections over the next season to look beyond just you know if there's an impact of the mtor inhibitor on immune function is it specific to vaccines or does it look like it's broadly boosting an immune function um and again i think you can you know you can look at the data and um and not be completely convinced but certainly for the everolimus plus rtb 101 and the rtb-101 alone group i think the ever-alignments alone group in this case didn't reach statistical significance but for the combination and the rtb 101 alone group they saw improved vaccine response and i think what was really striking was a lower risk of upper respiratory tract infection in the people who'd gotten the mtor inhibitor over the next season so that suggested that not only is it boosting vaccine response but it's also broadly conferring protection against a variety of of immune challenges in this this older population and again very very little in the way of adverse events which which gets back to the point you know you hear people talk about how mtor inhibitors you know you could never use them for aging and people because the side effects are so bad and you know it just gets frustrating over and over and over again to say go read the data you know go look at the data right that's just not true at the doses that that you know have been tested so far it's just that's just blatantly false right there's no evidence actually for significant side effects from rapamycin monotherapy everolimus monotherapy or rtb 101 uh at the doses that people are talking about using in this context yeah i mean statins have far far greater side effects i know i mean and it's not even close and you know i think statins are a very important type of drug but you know i mean to think that to think how ubiquitous they are and that we accept hey 10 of people i mean i think the literature says 5 but really clinically 10 of people have debilitating muscle aches from statins that you know render it impossible to take them people some people have elevated liver function tests that are otherwise unexplained i mean uh yeah yeah it is it is really frustrating for me to hear this especially when people talk about how well we could never really study rapamycin because you know it's just too unsafe it's like i i'm not sure what data you're pointing to but when when you have it let me know yeah yeah i agree um so anyways uh so that so that was the second phase two trial which was successful so then they went on to a phase three trial to uh to hopefully get fda approval for improving vaccine response and immune function in elderly people um and in that phase three trial um i'm trying to remember what they called that they think they called it i don't i don't remember the trial but now what was rad001 what was that agent that's ever alignment that's the same that's what they were calling over alignments okay yes okay yeah and they had a name for that all clinical trials have names so they had a name i i don't remember what it was but but in that phase three clinical trial um they only tested rtb-101 so they they took out the wrap-a-log ever alignments and only tested rtb 101. so there was no rad001 plus rt right b101 okay that's right no combination no individual wrapalog that's right and that clinical trial failed to hit the endpoint and it was it was terminated halfway through so they this is my understanding um they they were going to do uh uh one group in the fall season and one group in the spring season or something like that and they got halfway through they weren't hitting their end points so they terminated the trial early and um and then rtb 101 or sorry restore bio was the company that was doing this clinical trial to try to move rtb 101 through to approval they the board basically um merged them with uh with a car t cell therapy cancer company and they gave up on um rtb 101 because of the failed clinical trial so you know why that clinical trial failed i think still the data has not seen the light of day yet um i don't think uh there yeah i don't think it's come out yet so so we don't know for sure what happened um i think you know we can observe that the rapalog wasn't in there anymore right that is one difference between the two successful trials and the one that failed and i believe joan has talked about this publicly that that they also in conversations with the fda were required to change the end point um uh from laboratory confirmed infections right that that was the prior that was the that was the end point one of the endpoints in the phase two trial um to something else which involved owner reported or not owners sorry thinking about dog trials here patient reported symptoms as the end point and they didn't hit it and so i think that i think my understanding from talking to joan is that data will come out at some point and you know we'll be able to really take a look and and see you know what the drug was doing and what it what it wasn't doing in that third clinical trial my intuition is that it probably worked and they probably got screwed um by being forced to change the the endpoint of that clinical trial and if that's the case then i think you know we really do need to have a conversation around the way that fda i mean we need to have this conversation anyway but the way that fda is approaching clinical trials um uh in the the aging space right um what what needs to be shown for an appropriate endpoint and what is the acceptable level of risk when the uh the goal of the trial is to test whether or not an intervention is affecting a functional decline that goes along with aging or aging itself right and that's a that's a bigger question i certainly have plenty of thoughts around that i know there are lots of people in the field who are thinking about this and working on it and some have talked to fda um it's a it's a real challenge and i think i think that um i don't want to blame anything on fda right i think that they are the people at fda want to do their jobs to the best of their ability i think there are constraints around the way that fda is required to work and the culture that does not in my view appropriately evaluate risk reward right i think that there is a culture of you know the risk has to be extremely low in people who are of normal health status for their age i actually am trying very hard i still slip but i'm trying very hard not to use the word healthy when we talk about aging or older people i'm relatively healthy for my age i would say i'm probably in the top 10 percent health-wise for my age group i am not as healthy as i was 20 years ago we already talked about this right so i'm of you know normal to upper health status for my age but i would not call a 65 year old a typical 65 or 70 year old healthy they're not they're functionally impaired and we really need we being you know the regulators society policy makers you know really need i think to start taking a realistic look at what normal aging is right it is a progressive chronic decline in function that at some point will lead to overt disease and with a hundred percent probability will lead to death right and so if if we can if we can intervene in that process to slow it down or reverse it there should be some level of risk that is acceptable for that potential outcome and i think that because we tend to think of 65 70 year olds as healthy as opposed to functionally impaired it makes it really hard to have a rational discussion around what the appropriate level of risk is matt i think i think that is so astonishingly well said and i've had so many discussions with near um and to a lesser extent steve osted about the choice of metformin over rapamycin in tame and it always comes back to this point which is the regulators will absolutely positively not consider rapamycin which of course comes back to this question which is what are what are we what are we claiming to be studying and in whom yeah the other thing is you know the studies are being designed around disease right progression of disease or outcomes of disease so this really comes back to a broader theme which is where are we on the spectrum of understanding aging in the way that you're defining it and getting it further away from the discrete definition that involves a disease because until we really get people to center around that your very eloquent explanation of there being no such thing as a healthy 70 year old until we realize that at the regulatory level right at the policy level even at the scientific level it's going to be very difficult to study the things that will have an opportunity to give step function changes in longevity yeah so let me let me start by pushing back on on what you said about tame and metformin versus rapamycin because i i think that's a myth that regulators would not allow you to do a clinical trial with rapamycin right we just talked about three clinical trials that were done you know with mtor inhibitors two of which were with everelimus right um which is essentially rapamycin so i think that is um talked about as to why metformin was chosen for tame i don't think that is true and i don't actually think that is the reason at all um i think that the regulation i i push i i needle near constantly about it well i mean honestly i think i think there are good reasons why metformin you know makes sense to test in that in that context and there's data in people that that support that so i'm i'm not i'm not trying to say they should have used rapidmine sure i think that you know people with expertise in the field can come to differing opinions as to what the what the best shot on goal is i guess is the way i would put it you're just saying let's let's say we picked rapam i let's just say yeah we picked metformin because of these reasons but not because we thought that rappa wouldn't be safe enough or the regulators themselves would decline yeah i think they'd let you do the trial obviously they would pay attention to adverse events and there would be concerns around adverse events but um but they would certainly let you do the trial and and that's been proven right i mean restore bio did the trial right um uh and it wasn't because of adverse events that it got shut down i think that's the other important point to make i think the regulators at fda are are doing the best job that they can within the constraints of how they are required to to um to regulate drugs i have a real problem with the way we regulate drugs in this country but i don't necessarily blame it on the people at fda um but i do and i do think if you came to them with a clinical trial where you had an end point that was quantitative and functional and related to quality of life in people they would let you do that clinical trial with rapamycin i i'm 100 certain of that the the the challenge is i think the reason why this hasn't happened one rapamycin's off patent nobody's going to make money off of it and two there is a misplaced concern about side effects which we've already talked about it's just not reality that the risk is is significant at doses of rapamycin that would be tested so i think the real challenge though is identifying the right endpoints for a clinical trial in aging you're not going to do life span in people we can do it in dogs you're not going to do it in people i think we just have to accept that so what so what is the the right or what is i don't even want to say the right approach because i don't think there's one but what are some approaches that one might consider if your goal is to move fda towards approving a drug in people of normal health status to prevent age-related functional declines in disease right to target aging that's what that's what i mean when i say prevent age-related functional declines in disease to target aging so if your goal is to get there so what does that clinical trial look like so the tame trial is a specific example of one strategy which is to take people who are already have one age-related disease and ask whether your intervention metformin in this case can delay the onset of of the second age-related disease it's a comorbidity trial um that makes a lot of sense because we know with with with pretty good precision how long that time frame is on average from the first age-related disease to the to the second age-related disease and so you can quantitatively assess does your intervention increase that length of time that's the rationale behind tame in my personal view the limitation of that approach is it's not a true healthy aging study right it's not taking people who are who are of normal health status for their age and asking whether the intervention can improve or extend the healthy period of life right so it's a different design but but i totally get why that's that's tame was designed that way and i and i like the the design i think there's a reasonable chance it'll work um but but it's different from the way i would think about a clinical trial in this space what i would do is i would try to identify the best single endpoint or set of endpoints that correspond to a significant functional deficit that impacts quality of life in older people and assess whether or not my intervention improves that and optimally that endpoint would have quantitative markers that you could measure right to show that you've improved it so restore bio went with immune function and they they went with vaccine response initially and then ultimately i think in the phase three trial they were also looking at respiratory tract infections right over the next season that was their endpoint it's quantitative the problem is it's really hard right it's a really noisy endpoint and i'm i'm not at all criticizing them in fact i think you know as you know joan manick is one of my favorite people she's a good friend i have an amazing amount of respect for her i think they went for it and for reasons that were probably beyond their control you know that clinical trial failed but i have so much respect for what they tried to do i'm just saying it's a tough clinical trial it's a tough endpoint it's noisy i i think there are other endpoints that you could consider that um that might not be as noisy right that you could consider doing a clinical trial for so my one of my favorites at this at this moment is um periodontal disease and that's because you know my lab has published that in that aged mice get periodontal disease that um uh eight weeks of treatment with rapamycin reverses the clinically defining features of periodontal disease in mice we know that something like two-thirds of older adults have periodontal disease or will get it and those who have periodontal disease are at higher risk for dementia cardiovascular disease diabetes so it's connected in some way to other age-related diseases and and by the way uh you know rece a recent podcast of mine explored this topic and and it may in fact be causally related through that inflammatory axis right i mean i think absolutely that's probably the strongest line of evidence connecting oral disease with systemic disease it's through this immune inflammatory pathway so i think that's actually an elegant approach so the reason why i like periodontal disease right is the endpoints are extremely quantitative right so what we looked at in the mice are gingival inflammation bone around the teeth which can be measured you know crudely by pocket depth more quantitatively by x-ray um and microbiome that's that's really the at least in my understanding i'm not a dentist but i've learned a lot about uh oral health over the last few years that's my understanding of you know if you have gingival inflammation you've lost enough bone around the teeth you don't even have to have the dysregulation of the oral microbiome but it always goes along with it you've got periodontal disease right so there are nice quantitative endpoints that can be looked at in people and it's extremely non-invasive right the the way that you do this clinical trial is you have people come in for a for a dental exam right before and after treatment so you've got you've got a shot at seeing quant changes in quantitative endpoints that we can not just delay but actually reverse the declines in mice in people you know in a reasonable time frame so you could easily imagine something similar to the structure of the restore bio trial with rapamycin or everolimus or rtb101 or you know pick your favorite intervention where you treat people for eight weeks three months you know they have a dental exam before a dental exam after a dental exam six months later and you just look and see what was the what was the impact of the the intervention um so it's a pretty straightforward clinical trial and you know i think we're gonna i hope we will get this off the ground we're actually trying to get some funding to do a clinical trial now um this is this is i should say in humans or in dogs in people yeah in people and this is this is really the person who deserves all the credit for for me this crystallizing in my mind is a uh a gentleman named jonathan ahn who was a dds phd student so so he had already got his dental degree he did his phd with me and he you know before he came to my lab he came to me one one day um i vividly remember this conversation because i had never thought about oral health and he goes you know people get periodontal disease when they get older in much the same way that people get alzheimer's disease or heart disease if you look at the risk profile as a function of age it looks strikingly similar to these other age-related diseases you know what do you think maybe the biology of aging is contributing and you know in hindsight it's like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense but i had never thought about that before and so he came to my lab and showed that we could do this in mice we could we could see age-related periodontal disease we could see bone loss around the teeth we could see inflammation of the gums and that we could reverse that with rapamycin and so he's actually now a faculty member um at the university of washington and he's really the one who's trying to push this clinical trial forward so so i'm sort of peripherally involved but john is really the guy in this space he's going to be a rock star and this would be a phase two yes right what's the approximate budget for this we're just submitting the grant now so i don't know you know it's very early right what would be the budget for this study uh so it's going to be a three-year grant you know i don't know it's i think it's r01 size couple hundred thousand a year uh over three years okay if money were no object what secondary endpoints would you add to that study in other words if you could power this study to hit that as your primary but also go after multiple secondaries let's just throw in immune function there'd be no reason not to repeat what was done with uh rad001 what else would you add to that right so if you look at the mouse data i mean i think i think the mouse data is uh uh it's a reasonable place to start again obviously mice aren't people it's a reasonable place to start so where does rapamycin reverse functional declines associated with aging hearing right it wasn't there yeah study that just came out yeah it just came out two weeks absolutely it reversed age-related hearing loss which i i that was that got me very excited yeah i agree so that and that's again a very easy and quantitative endpoint right wouldn't it be amazing if you could improve age-related hearing loss with rapamycin and and so that's a no-brainer immune function i mean i agree if money was no option sure but but even in the context of a of a you know let's say the periodontal disease clinical trial that i that i talked about if you could also measure hearing in that clinical trial right it's a big big bang for the buck right it costs you almost nothing and you get potentially another endpoint that you could hit on where else so muscle function there's pretty good evidence that at least rapamycin can prevent sarcopenia i don't think there's a lot of data yet on improvements in muscle function but you could do things like you know grip strength walk speed things like that cognitive function that's hard again that's i put that in the sort of the same category as immune function as an endpoint it's a tough endpoint but it would certainly be interesting to look at cognitive function in this elderly population of normal health status so some of these people are going to be on the road to dementia they won't have dementia yet because that's an entrance criteria to get into the into the trial heart function is another place where we see reversal of of age-related declines this would be heart so this is a different this is a different clinical trial but also potentially cool reproductive function you wouldn't do that in that same patient population probably but in mice there's pretty good evidence that you can reverse uh at least in females uh reproductive declines that go along with aging or at least delay them let's just pause on that for a second matt that is staggering when you consider where we are today from from a standpoint of reproductive medicine right yeah women are having children later and later and i i can't tell you the number of just patients in my practice either male or female for whom this isn't a top of mind priority it's it's simply unbelievable and to think that there would be a you know i never really had thought of this honestly because i don't think i've paid attention to that subset of the rapamycin literature if you were to and again this is guessing but but how much of an impact you think you could have so if you if you had a woman who was 40 years old who's been you know she's obviously still pre-menopausal but her amh is low and or it's reasonable but she's got significant aneuploidy uh for the listener meaning when whenever her eggs are produced they don't evenly divide into the right number of chromosomes so they don't show up with one of each chromosome and that's an enormous cause of infertility as a woman ages is this aneuploidy so they either omit a chromosome or include two and those almost universally lead um to an early miscarriage some of them like trisomy you know 13 or you know we'll make 21 will make it um do you have a sense of what type of magnitude of an effect this could have i think the honest answer is no so i think there's a couple things to say on this one is there's not a lot there have been i think two or three studies in mice looking at this right and so there's not a lot of data on magnitude of effect um uh uh even in mice so my guess is that that that in in people so i i i don't even want to comment on magnitude of effects i really don't know i think the way that you would um design a clinical trial though would be very similar to what we've talked about with rapamycin already with the immune function or periodontal disease you would take you know a woman pre-menopausal let's say early 40s a group of women and do you know eight weeks of treatment right and then a washout and then you could look at your endpoints or if they are going through ivf for example right look and see whether or not you get you get an improvement uh in outcome using that functional measure i i i would i mean now why i would say do we really believe that that would be a sufficient amount of time i mean are we just coming up with eight weeks because that's where we saw the vaccine response uh in the evralimus trial like or do we think we you know if you if you were shooting for the moon and costs were not an issue what would be the downside of longer treatment well a couple things right so so one is uh increased risk of side effects right i mean i think that's that's that's one the longer you go with any treatment the more risk there is for for an adverse event even though i think the risks are pretty low um and the other is i think so so with the here's a here's a really interesting piece of data that we don't have with the immune function studies in mice or people in all of those studies the treatment was stopped that's right and then there was a two week or so period before the the vaccine was given so what was the rationale for that washout i think it's because people think and thought about rapamycin as an immune suppressant right so that you might if so and this is where i was going with that what we don't know is if they were still taking the drug would you have gotten the same effects for immune function i i don't know so so it's an important question that i think we just don't know the answer to but the other risk is that at least for some of your your functional measures if it requires let's say hyperactivation of mtor to get the the response um you might impair that by doing continued treatment with rapamycin and at least all of the data that i've seen limited in people extensive and mice uh eight weeks is enough to give you essentially that full benefit for whatever the functional output is that you're looking at maybe not for lifespan right maybe maybe maybe multiple eight week you know transient interventions would be better than one only thing that i know of for data there is our study where we did three months right of rapamycin treatment between 20 and 23 months of age and then let them go to the end of life the magnitude of effect was pretty similar to what the itp saw so it was it was reasonably close to continuing um treatment but we don't know but eight weeks in mice is you know what would that be in humans right yeah i know where you're going with that right if yeah if you were to linearly extrapolate that that would be a few years right in people um and i agree with that i think that the the the immune uh phys the immune trials uh that we've talked about suggest that that might be long enough um but i agree we don't know we don't know is the answer i'll just say so i haven't talked about you know my experience with rapamycin and i really don't talk about this publicly but i'll do it here um so uh so i've i've tried uh eight to ten week courses of rapamycin a couple of times um the most recent time it was because this was probably spring of 2019 so i'm pretty active i play softball in the spring um and i noticed i had a lot of shoulder pain and and by the end of the season it was to the point where i i couldn't throw a football like i couldn't go play catch with my son actually that's one of the hardest uh personal sort of aging experiences i had was when we went across the street to the park and i was gonna gonna play catch with my son and i couldn't do it because my shoulder hurts so much in my right shoulder and i thought i must have a rotator cuff tear i went in to see the specialist finally got diagnosed uh uh with a frozen shoulder which is inflammation of the shoulder capsule which happens to people as they some people as they get older extremely painful completely limited my range of motion and the doctor was like well i could give you a shot of cortisol but i don't really recommend it that can that can degrade the cartilage really there's not a lot you can do some people it goes away after a year some people just you just learn to live with that and i was pretty depressed by that diagnosis right i was like at least if it was a rotator cuff too i could get surgery get it fixed so i go home and i'm sitting there and i'm thinking so i'm looking on the internet and i see okay it's an inflammation of the shoulder capsule i'm thinking to myself what do i know that has anti-inflammatory effects you know in the context of aging right rapamycin so i so i got some rapamycin and i did eight weeks and i mean again placebo effect is real but this was so painful i don't believe it was placebo effect within two weeks i had probably half my range of motion back within eight weeks uh i was back 100 95 and were you just taking were you just dosing once a week once a week eight migs once a week yeah i mean i i i couldn't do this two years ago right because it hurt so much right um and now it doesn't hurt at all within eight weeks of and i i wanna be careful cause i wanna say i'm not encouraging other people to go do this but i am a true believer after that experience right i don't think it's placebo effect i don't see how it could be with how painful it was how real the limitations were on range of motion so that goes to this eight-week question at least for that indication which i believe this was a real effect eight weeks was plenty and it hasn't come back right which actually kind of makes sense with frozen shoulder i think when when people recover from it it doesn't always come back so i think that again a lot of these age-related conditions that are inflammatory driven you can kind of reset that with an eight-week treatment and and rap mice and i suspects analytics if we had goods analytics would do pretty much the same thing do you think that rapamycin is itself a centalytic i don't think it's analytic in the sense that it that it at least the classical way people have thought about analytics where it kills the senescent cell right i absolutely think it turns down the chronic inflammatory signaling that is driven by p16 p21 nf kappa b yes we see that in mice multiple tissues no question about it i also you know i still think the senescence field is a little bit messy in the terminology i think a lot of what people call senescence isn't truly being derived from senescent cells the way that we think about them it's p16 p21 mediated inflammatory cytokines right doesn't necessarily have to come from senescent cells no question rapamycin shuts that off and it shuts it off within eight weeks at least in mice in a lot of tissues and do you think it's doing that independent of what it's doing at the mtor or uh do you think that it's doing that through mtor i would be shocked if it's not doing that through mtor i don't know of any good evidence that rapamycin has off-target effects that aren't through mtor yeah okay and so so really it's these sasps getting whacked that is how it would act through via the senescent pathway as opposed to targeting a senescent cell directly but that's by the way that's been my reading of the literature would you agree with that yeah but it's really i think that's right i think i think in some way it shuts off that those chronic inflammatory signals the secretories yeah yeah yeah and maybe other stuff right i mean we always look at the sas because that's what we know i mean i think you know this is natural in science we look under the lamp post we we measure what we know to measure right it would not shock me at all if there are other things that that go along with the canonical sasp that centalytics or rapamycin or caloric restriction i think that's a big part of fasting fasting does the same thing right it camps down on that that chronic inflammatory signaling um maybe through mtor maybe through other mechanisms so so i think that you know what we know about is part of it it wouldn't shock me if there was there were things we don't know about yet that also are contributing yeah but but getting back to this this eight week right that's how we got started so i tend to think based on my personal experience and the little bit of data from these two clinical trials that that's probably long enough for at least some endpoints that are driven primarily by immune dysregulation and chronic inflammation yeah i you know i think two and a half years ago when i started i was very strict about eight on six off eight on six off eight on six off and i don't know a little while ago i just sort of said yeah i'm just not coming off and i wish i had a biomarker to point to i wish i had some way of measuring whether this is the right thing to do or if there's a or if you know eight four eight four eight four right there's a symmetry to eight five because you'll get through exactly four cycles a year maybe i do eight five eight five eight five eight five um but it really frustrates me that we don't have a biomarker for this yeah or or aging in general yeah for age in general so let's talk a little bit about that so what is what does that look like i mean when i had eileen white on the podcast uh gosh it's been maybe a year and a half now we had a really interesting discussion about why we don't even have biomarkers for autophagy i mean something that is so important and we can't measure it and this was important in the context of people who choose to calorically restrict or fast um right you know is fasting for a day long enough to generate a meaningful amount of autophagy in a human in a mouse it clearly is but in a human is it no idea is right two days three days seven days you know seven days is almost assuredly enough it's a big difference between fasting for a day and fasting for seven days why don't we have biomarkers for that why don't we have a biomarker that can assess nutrient sensing better why don't we have a you know i mean you could argue we have some biomarkers we can measure telomere length but you know you know my feelings on this matt i'm in the camp that thinks measuring telomere length is not helpful at all for aging and i think there's plenty of data to suggest that while telomere length is a very important marker of cellular division it really speaks very little about the orgas the organism's state of aging um despite the popularity of that that biomarker right um even the epigenetic clocks i don't find to be helpful i find them to be far too and i'd like you to push back on this if you feel as much um but i i've seen how easily they can be manipulated by short-term interventions that don't seem biologically relevant yeah so i think i'll start with the epigenetic clock because everybody that's a big yeah you know let's let's explain to people what that is let's start from the beginning assume people don't know what an epigenetic clock is right so so the epigenetic clock refers to typically chemical marks on dna that regulate gene expression whether or not you know the gene that is located at specific points in your genome gets turned on or or off and what has been observed is that those marks change with age in pretty much every organism where it's been studied and that you can identify patterns of change at specific locations in the genome so specific changes in these chemical marks with age that correlate very uh strongly with chronological age and and so that has led to the idea that you can create clocks that look at specific changes and chemical marks in the the dna the genome that are um telling you something about how long that that organism has been alive um and then what sort of has emerged from that is that there may be you there are two things that have emerged from that one is you may be able to use that chronological aging clock to find individuals whose marks don't fall on the line that you would expect it to fall on based on their chronological age in other words you know they have marks that make them look older or younger than their chronological age says that they are and so you might you would hypothesize that those individuals biologically if those marks are really reflecting biological age might be aging more slowly or more quickly and what's been shown is that indeed those individuals who tend to be off the line depending on whether they seem to be aging more slowly or more quickly are at lower or higher risk for specific diseases so that adds some level of confidence that this epigenetic clock chronological epigenetic aging clock is actually reflecting biological age and so the idea is maybe we can use that information to develop epigenetic clocks that will that will in a predictive way tell you how old you are biologically right so you can get tests now there are plenty of companies now that are selling these things where you can go buy your epigenetic blood test mostly this has been done in blood cells that's one limitation to think about is almost all of the literature in humans is developed on epigenetic clocks from blood and it's it's still i think a little bit of a question you know what if even if this is reflecting biological age it's the biological age of your blood which may or may not reflect the biological age of your entire body um but you can buy tests now that based on your you give them some of your blood they will tell you your epigenetic biological age or some number so they're they're looking at uh pbmc i assume i don't know honestly i'm not i'm not involved in any of this stuff um uh so i don't i don't know exactly what yes most of the studies that have been published are are pbmcs i don't i don't i don't they may even have saliva tests now i don't know honestly how these commercial companies are doing it i mean some of the clocks i've seen where i've just immediately discounted them is when some of their inputs are things like glucose level vitamin d level which are things that vary so much from day to day and by the way are so easy to manipulate like you you can take a vitamin d supplement or not take a vitamin d supplement you can you know have a high cortisol spike one morning and your glucose is 110 versus have a good sleep the night before your glucose is 95. so something that's that malleable i just don't think makes sense as a as a as an iron-clad uh marker of of true you know biologic age yeah so let me take a step back so the epigenetic clocks right are probably the one that people talk about the most and have gotten the most traction in the field and and i'm not i'm not i'm not i guess i'm a little bit of a skeptic but i mean i believe these clocks i believe the data and i believe that um that the correlations are extremely strong i you know i'm a little bit worried still that there are so many data points in the epigenome that you can find a pattern that will fit anything you go looking for and that so i'm a little bit worried about the dimensionality of the data and and whether or not you know it's it's pattern matching in some cases um rather than then it's really truly going to be a robust predictor of biological age that probably reflects what is admittedly you know my limited understanding of the mathematics behind a lot of the epigenetic clocks that have been built so i don't i i don't view that as a strong criticism it's just a personal sort of concern that i that i have so you're basically saying without without doing the the complex mathematics to correct for so many the multiple looks that you can take at the data yeah you could be tricked and and i and i i i i have not spent enough time looking at that either i would like to have steve horvath on the podcast at some point uh because i think steve could speak to that probably better than anyone else and he's the expert yeah so that's but the other the other point i wanted to make is what what you alluded to is now what people are doing is going beyond the epigenetic clocks to try to look at every possible thing you could measure sometimes combining that with the epigenetic clock to build these super clocks or multi-clocks or multi-omic clocks right and i think there's huge power in that but it also increases that dimensionality problem that i just mentioned because you know all of the sudden now you've got if you're doing omics stuff you've got tens of thousands of additional data points that you can measure and you can fit a pattern where a lot of this and i think i think even steve and other people who are in the epigenetic clock field would agree with this where a lot of this has yet to really mature is in getting us to biological explanations for what the patterns are telling us right what genes are are they that these these marks are located at and are those in any way causal for you know biological aging so i think if you get to the point where you can understand mechanism it's going to be much more powerful i also think though this gets to the fundamental challenge with biomarkers and i think this is where you're dissatisfied we have a lot of biomarkers of aging we just don't have any validated biomarkers of aging right and it's and it's a it's a real this has been a problem you know since i was a graduate student um everybody's wanted biomarkers of aging the nia had a huge program where they they did all this funding to identify biomarkers of aging i think it was back in the 80s right right maybe before my time 90s maybe you can identify all sorts of things that correlate with age how do you get to the point of convincing yourself first and other people second that these things are actually telling you something about biological aging that can then be used to understand whether an intervention is working first of all at the population level but ultimately where we want to get to is at the individual level right so what we all want is a test that you can take and you can fast you can do your fasting regimen you can do your rapamycin you can take metformin whatever and you can come back and find out is it working from this set of biomarkers and and that's where we want to get to and and we're not there yet i think everyone would agree i'm not sure when we're going to get there so who's the natural owner of getting there because you know i had this discussion with steve austed recently and and he he made the same point you did which is look the nia tried to do this a long time ago and and and tried you know validly right they put a lot of money into it you could make the case that the technology simply wasn't mature enough to do this 30 30 years later we have a lot more tools at our disposal right it's yes you've got you've got the entire world of omics at your disposable plus you've got machine learning plus plus plus um is there any reason this couldn't be done today and if so is this this strikes me as a project that's almost too big for for academics right because it's too disjointed but at the same time it's not a particularly interesting commercial problem to solve because it's far too big an investment before you could get to why you would care about it right a commercial problem is give me a drug yeah but i'm arguing you can't develop a drug really well without this so who's like there's a bit of a a cart and a horse thing which is someone's got a pony up a lot of money to develop the foundation of a pyramid that will ultimately become a great tool for drug discovery and a much more streamlined manner in which we could do clinical trials around this yeah so so i think it i think the answer to your question is it depends on whether you're talking about doing this pre-clinically or clinically right i i actually think this is don't you think it has to be done both uh well eventually yes it's it's it's a problem that can be solved today pre-clinically like there is no real barrier to doing what you just said so multi-omic analysis of aging in mice with interventions applying machine learning to identify patterns that predict the effect of interventions and individual outcomes for longevity you obviously have to think a little bit about you know what what can you measure if you want to do this longitudinally right you can't kill them the animals right uh um so you could you're sort of restricted to blood but so there are some practical aspects but there's no there's no technical barrier to doing that now who should do it who might be doing it right um i mean i think this would fall maybe in the realm of what calico could do right they've got the resources they've got the expertise is there any evidence that calico is interested in this type of a problem um i think so i i don't i don't know i don't honestly don't know anything about the inner workings of calico these days um i think conceptually they are interested in in multi-ohmic signatures of different aging processes i don't know if they've done this particular experiment they certainly have the resources and expertise to do it they're not the only ones but they're the first ones who come to mind and they sort of fit this space between true academia and industry right where they're kind of the kind of this interesting beast in the middle um so i think it could be done pre-clinically and you could actually then once you let's just say you have this test right you get to the end of day you say okay these are the most predictive i don't know whatever 24 things that give you you know 95 confidence on remaining life right or whatever whatever your end point is um then you you get that test and then you show whether it works or not in an independent study and if it does i'd be pretty convinced right if you can show me that you create this test and then you go do a separate experiment and you can predict when the mice are six months old how long they're gonna live at an individual level i'm impressed and if you can show that this intervention when you treat them makes the signature go in the way that you think it should go and you can predict they're going to live 30 longer i'm even more impressed i'll believe it at that point that's not easy but i think it's doable i think we know enough now we've got enough things that we could measure that you could certainly you could certainly build the test and then whether it would work in the validation step or not i don't know but i wouldn't i i think you could probably get it to work um you can't take exactly that same approach to people and this gets back to that that you know the same issue that we talked about clinical trials right it takes a long time to do the validation step and know that you have actually changed somebody's biological state so that as they get older they are at lower risk for disease and are likely to live some x percent longer so you're almost obligated to have some level you you have to have some level of faith in the test at that point right and i don't know it's going to be different for everybody and i honestly don't know what the regulatory step has to be right before you could convince regulators that you can actually you know go out and tell the general public that this test works although i will say there are already people doing that and the regulators aren't doing anything about it as far as i can tell so you know there you are let's come back to your dogs we spoke about them at length um three years ago when we sat down to to talk about rapamycin but again let's assume a clean slate and folks might not be familiar with some of your work specifically around dogs and how working with companion dogs offers many advantages over working in mice beginning with some of the obvious like they're far more genetically similar to us they live in our environment right and you know they also seem to to die of things that more closely replicate how we die they die of heart failure they die of cancer but not the same type of cancer that a mouse gets that's almost genetically predetermined yeah so um so just to start from ground zero uh we um at the university of washington and texas a m and several other institutions have a large project called the dog aging project and so the goal of the dog aging project um is really to understand the biology of aging in companion dogs or pet dogs some people when i say companions some people think i mean you know like like dogs like that yeah no pet dogs um and there are really two aspects of this project one is a large scale longitudinal study of aging completely observational the goal there is really just to understand what are the most important genetic and environmental factors that influence healthy aging in dogs and part of that this is getting back to the conversation we just had is to measure as much as we can about those dogs every year as they go through their lives in order to be able to identify patterns right that are associated with health outcomes during aging lifespan disease incidents um so in some respects it's a similar approach as to what you would do if you wanted to create biomarkers of aging right um so that's the longitudinal study of aging the second goal and that so one way to think about that is that's to try to understand aging in dogs the second goal and this is really where i'm you know focused uh largely is to do something about it so can we slow or reverse biological aging in pet dogs to increase healthy lifespan and so that ultimately i hope will be a series of veterinary clinical trials to test interventions to figure out can we slow aging reduce disease and increase lifespan in pet dogs the first clinical trial is with rapamycin and so that's our first shot on goal uh but i hope it won't be the only one um and so you talked about so why why dogs why pet dogs in particular and i think you hit on i think most of them the most important reasons right so they've got this really interesting and powerful genetic architecture we have a couple hundred purebred breeds of dogs which you can almost think of as inbred strains right and then on top of that we have this mixed breed population and that's coupled with with phenotypic diversity so for almost any trait that you think about dogs are more diverse than people are even body size is a really easy one everybody can just think about the difference between a great dane and a chihuahua um so that combination of of unique genetic architecture with with phenotypic diversity is really powerful for mapping genotype onto specific traits and lifespan is another case where you have this strong diversity right a great dane will grow old and die you know maybe in eight to ten years uh whereas a chihuahua often will live to be 16 17 years old so you know we're talking 100 percent difference in lifespan um so that so so that's really powerful for mapping genotype onto lifespan uh dogs share the human environment is another big one right and that's that's for me one of the most important because we cannot model that in the laboratory in fact we do exactly the opposite we really try to limit variation in environment to extreme measures dogs share our environment with the exception of diet share almost all aspects of the of the human environment and so that's a a bridge in some ways between laboratory studies and human studies and as i've already alluded to they age more rapidly than we do their lifespan is substantially shorter we all are familiar with the idea of one human year is about seven dog years right that's just another way of saying dogs age about seven times faster than people do um that's and we can talk about that it's interesting if you actually look at the epigenetic clock it's not a linear seven time rate but but they but i think it's close enough right it's close enough uh and as you suggested they age very similarly to the way that people do they get essentially all of the same age-related diseases and they're all age related and they show the same functional declines that people do so dogs get arthritis as they get older right uh you you know an arthritis is i guess it's a disease but it also starts as a functional decline right anybody who's ever had an old dog you will notice that your old dog doesn't move around as much doesn't walk as fast right so so so they are going through the same changes with aging at the functional level that that we are again it just happens seven to ten times more quickly so they're a very powerful animal in which to understand aging and test interventions for that reason and you can do it in a time frame that's that's you know feasible that's again i think you know we've talked about the challenges with doing a clinical trial for lifespan in people even if we believe metformin is going to extend lifespan in people you're not going to do a clinical trial to prove that you can do that clinical trial in dogs and so we've designed the the rapamycin the test of rapamycin in aging dogs or triad that's that's what we call our clinical trial we've designed triad so that we'll be able we'll be powered statistically powered to detect a 15 change in in lifespan within a three year window right so we can do a three year clinical trial reasonable cohort sizes to see an effect on lifespan that's comparable to what rapamycin does in mice that's a pretty high bar matt that's are you at all worried you've underpowered that given that you only have um and they're being administered the drug for the entire three years no uh so so yes uh yes i'm worried that the study is underpowered um i will say uh from my experience now we've done two safety clinical trials and this is our big clinical trial so this is my third veterinary clinical trial i've learned that there are many reasons to be concerned when you do a clinical trial clinical trials are a lot of guesswork you have to take an educated guess about a lot of different things you can't test every dose you can't test every duration you're you know you can't test you know an infinite number of study subjects so i'm i'm worried about this clinical trial for many reasons um i think we've done the best that we can you know given what we know and given the constraints that we have to work under to give ourselves a reasonable shot 15 might be a high bar uh but it you know it's it's consistent with the lower end of what people see in mice so the first study at the low low dose of rapamycin and mice from the itp had a 14 effect i think in females and a 9 effect in males subsequent studies at higher doses had larger effects so do you expect to see a sex difference in dogs i don't know i don't know um so people still don't completely understand why female mice seems to respond to a given dose of rapamycin better than male mice so it's correlated with blood levels so i think the simple idea is that that male mice uh either take up rapamycin less effectively or break it down more quickly there's no evidence for that in dogs we will be measuring rapamycin levels in the dogs so we will see if there is a difference in blood uh concentration in females versus males from the limited data that we've got so far we don't have any evidence that that's the case in dogs and i don't know of any evidence in people that that's the case either so that might be a mouse specific thing i think there's this misperception uh that rapamycin you know works better in female mice than in male mice that's not true at a given dose we don't know if it's true right no no given dose in the food at lower doses females show a bigger lifespan extension when you go to higher doses the males catch up and if you push it too far you can actually find a dose where female mice the lifespan extension starts to go back the other direction and male mice actually get a bigger lifespan extension so i think it's more about effective concentration than it is a male versus female um truly sex-specific response and in the dogs you give it daily in their food no no so it's once a week okay so this is a now now you know yeah guess what right now we're the best way to do the alchemy yeah yeah so we've tested three times a week uh uh and once a week uh and we decided to go with once a week for for triad um uh uh and you know it's a guess and how many makes per gig are they getting is it one dose 0.15 migs per gig once a week and that was based on our observations from 0.05 makes per gig three times a week yeah that's how we get you know 0.05 times three so let's talk about what might be going on in the itps which i've i've had rich mill around here let me let me just come back to the dog study because i want to i want to i want to make another point which is that you asked if i was concerned about being underpowered for a 15 lifespan effect so lifespan is our primary endpoint right which is important because i think if i think this is the first clinical trial that has lifespan you know in a healthy or normal health status population as the endpoint i will say also it's funny because i get pushback from clinical people you can't call this a clinical trial it's a it's in dogs it's not in people and i just simply respond that a veterinary clinic is a clinic it's a veterinary clinical trial but it's a clinical trial and i think this is the first clinical trial with lifespan as the end point i don't know if you can hear my dog i can't stop spawning no no it's funny it's totally appropriate that as we're talking about dogs we can hear the dog the environment so um the point i want to make though is that lifespan is our primary endpoint but we are tracking multiple secondary endpoints to give us a picture of is rapamycin broadly impacting the aging process so we're looking every six months the dogs get echocardiograms to look at heart function the dogs will be fitted with activity monitors periodically to look at spontaneous activity every six months the dogs will get cognitive assessments to look at cognitive function we're getting blood chemistry serum metabolome fecal microbiome and of course we'll be tracking disease incidents as these dogs get older so you know over this three-year window i i i hope that even if we don't see that magnitude of lifespan extension and we don't reach statistical significance if there is a broad effect on multiple age related outcomes that we will be able to detect changes in in other secondary endpoints what's the sample size you're going to have two groups placebo versus dose right half placebo half treatment uh the goal the intention is to randomize 350 dogs equally split between the two groups so 175 of each and do you know roughly if you had gone with a 10 effect size how many that would have required how many more i don't recall off top of my head i think probably around 500. yeah in your previous work you had already got a sense of what was happening in animals with heart failure what remind people a little bit about that if they don't remember the first episode sure so there's there's really good data three at least three maybe four now studies from from different labs in mice showing that if you look at age-related declines in heart function particularly left ventricular function so the several measures of left ventricular function decline with age that rat that eight to ten weeks of rapamycin is enough to reverse those changes and make the the young heart by echocardiography look functionally like a make the old heart look like a young heart there's also data in mouse models of a few different types of heart failure so dilated cardiomyopathy is work that we've done in particular where you can reverse dilated cardiomyopathy in mice with rapamycin treatment so so i think there's really strong evidence in mice um in our first clinical trial which was it was designed to really only be a safety trial there were 24 dogs uh 16 got rapamycin 8 got the placebo but we had the dogs also get echocardiograms before and after the treatment period and in that study there were statistically significant improvements in two measures two of the three measures of left ventricular function by echocardiography in the dogs that got rapamycin compared to the placebo what was i think to me most interesting in that that data was that the improvements that we saw were exclusively found in the dogs that came in with lower function now one thing to note is none of these dogs had functions so low that it would be clinically diagnosed as heart failure right so it was it was normal age-related declines in function and it was exclusively the dogs with the lowest function that showed the improvements from rapamycin that is an interesting observation which my gut feeling is real again a small cohort so i don't you know want to want to make it out to be stronger than it is but it also is intuitive right we know that individuals have individual trajectories of aging and develop a unique spectrum of functional declines and it makes sense that some of these interventions that are restoring function would primarily be effective in people who've lost function just intuitive but i so i think that's probably what we'll we'll see you know in our long-term study in triad where we followed the dogs for three years is that there's going to be variation at baseline and it might be the case that those individuals that have the lowest function at baseline are the ones that are going to see the biggest benefit if there is a benefit at all now in triad will you be trying to create somewhat of a homogeneous sample in size by that i mean the size of the dogs or are you going to be completely heterogeneous with respect to the size of the animal and also what is the age of the animal what are the exclusion criterias around the age on either end lower high right right so age they have to be at least seven years old to come into the study so that'd be middle-aged and we do have a size range so the dogs have to be between 40 and 100 pounds to be randomized into the studies so it's not for little dogs that's right and the reason for that is not because we have any reason to think rapamycin will work differently or better or worse than little dogs it's because big dogs age faster than small dogs let me come back to that in a minute because that might not be that might be an oversimplification but they certainly live shorter than small dogs and develop many age-related diseases and functional declines at an accelerated rate compared to small dogs so we need a population you know that's already middle-aged and that will be aging rapidly to to be able to to see potential benefits from rapamycin in the time frame of this study and that was all factored into the power calculations the demography of of dogs in that that age and weight range um i said that it may not be completely accurate to say that big dogs age more rapidly than small dogs because there's a growing body of evidence which we have some preliminary data in support of as well that for brain aging and cognitive function that might not be the case that that the rate of cognitive decline in big dogs looks from a chronological sense very very similar to small dogs even though the big dogs are you know dying at an earlier age they don't seem to show accelerated cognitive decline which is interesting and i think there's a little bit of data you know in in people although obviously people don't show the same uh diversity in body size that dogs do so that's harder to see it doesn't really seem to be the case that body size accelerated aging due to increased body size is reflected in brain aging and the mechanisms there might turn out to be really interesting so just uh just an observation that i that i've i've noticed recently and i think might be important you're using once a week dosing explain to people um because we we just mentioned it briefly and then said we'd come back to it now we're going to sort of bifurcate mtor into mtor complex 1mtor complex to give people a sense of how those function and why it on the one hand is leading you to do what you're doing me to do what i'm doing and why in some ways it makes it a little bit interesting why the itp found what it did with daily dosing let's tie all of that together but first with an explanation of how mtor works sure so so mtor of course is a protein it's a kinase we already talked about that um but it acts in a complex with other partner proteins um and and so the mtor protein um acts in at least two i think there's only two that we know of uh two different complexes called mtor complex one or m torque one and mtor complex two or m torque two and the difference between those those complexes is that they have different partner proteins for mtor so there are a couple of things that are the same across both complexes and then there are a set of partner proteins that are unique and the two complexes do functionally different things in the cell so mtar complex one you know is largely thought of as the the mtor complex that is most responsive to nutrient levels so when nutrient signals are low that leads to lower mtor complex one activity and mtor complex one downstream is known to regulate things like autophagy mrna translation effects on metabolism [Music] and mtor complex 2 does different things and i think we know a lot about what mtor complex 1 does we know much less about what mtor complex 2 does although people are are studying that and learning more and more about what mtar complex 2 does from the perspective of aging biology people have focused almost exclusively on mtor complex 1. there's a little bit of data in c elegans on mtor complex 2 affecting lifespan but outside of c elegans almost all of the data for rapamycin or mtor as a regulator of aging is thought to be mediated by inhibition or reduced signaling through mtor complex one so that's what people almost always think about when they think about effects of mtor on aging and rapamycin as a drug biochemically is a specific inhibitor of mtor complex one so the way rapamycin works is it actually it's a small molecule that binds to another protein called fkbp12 or fpr1 in yeast and once rapamycin binds to fkbp12 that complex of rapamycin with fkbp12 goes to mtor complex one and you can think of it as sort of just messing it up breaks it apart so it inhibits mtor complex one when rapamycin is bind to fkbp12 so biochemically rapamycin is an extremely clean drug and that as far as i know and i haven't really seen any good data otherwise there's no direct inhibitory effect of rapamycin on anything other than mtor complex one what people have observed is that chronic long-term inhibition of mtor complex 1 can have feedback effects on mtor complex 2 and it's kind of confusing because there's actually some data both directions that chronic inhibition of mtor complex 1 can lead to activation of mtor complex 2 in some context mostly i think the data supports the idea that chronic inhibition of mtar complex 1 with rapamycin can lead to inhibition of mtor complex 2 in the long term um and that's definitely true in mice at higher doses of rapamycin at lower doses of rapamycin it's it's not completely clear to me how how much uh effect on mtor complex 2 there is so so the reason why that's interesting from the perspective of aging is i i just said that almost all of the data for lifespan at least is that it's inhibition of mtar complex 1 that leads to lifespan extension work from david sabatini and dudley lamming when he was in david's lab um led to the development of a model which which i think is still the sort of preferred model i will say up front i i think it's at least partly wrong but it's the preferred model which is that the side effects associated with rapamycin particularly the metabolic side effects associated with rapamycin are due to this chronic effect of inhibiting mtor complex 2. so people will talk about rapamycin as if it induces a something like diabetes a pseudo-diabetes and this is true in mice there's evidence for it in humans as well that that chronic long-term treatment with rapamycin leads to glucose intolerance so if you give a mouse who's been on rapamycin for you know a year a glucose tolerance test they will not clear that glucose as rapidly as a mouse that never saw rapamycin and the model is that that's due to the chronic effects of rapamycin on mtor complex 2. most of the evidence and support of that model comes from genetic experiments with with mtor complex 2 deficient mice so i have yet to see a really clean experiment showing that that that's that that's what accounts for the rapamycin effects uh on glucose tolerance i think it's a reasonable model in other words that evidence comes from creating genetic mice where you manipulate m torque 1 and m torque 2 rather than experiments where you give them give them mice rapamycin you know i didn't ask rich miller this question because i'm pretty sure the answer is they didn't do it but in all of the itps where the animals are getting rapamycin every single day did they see impaired glucose tolerance despite longer life yeah my recollection is they did not look but there have been other studies um i think mostly in the c57 black six j mouse strain so that's a different strain than the itp right we don't need to get into it but it's a different genetic background but in in the c57 uh background you do see the same changes in in uh glucose tolerance test at the i think at the 42 part per million for sure rapamycin dose so the higher itp dose uh um in older mice so so i think it's a real effect i think you see that effect with rapamycin and like i said there's evidence in organ transplant patients for impaired glucose homeostasis as well so i think it's a real effect um there's a couple of things that i and i actually my intuition is it probably is due to m torque too i don't i don't i don't have any reason to doubt that i just don't think it's been showing cleanly that that's the mechanism where i differ a little bit certainly from dudley i'm not sure what what david's view on this is right now um where i differ from dudley's interpretation is that i am less convinced that these effects uh that we see for glucose homeostasis are bad right i i think there's at least as much likelihood that what what this really reflects is an underlying change in in metabolism that might actually account for part of the beneficial effects of rapamycin where they shift away from primarily relying on on glucose as the preferred carbon source and switch over to fat metabolism and and maybe even ketogenesis to some extent and when in that context so it's a different physiological metabolic state in that context when you challenge them with a non-physiological amount of glucose they don't respond the same way so i don't know that it's actually a defect in glucose homeostasis i think it may reflect the the test that's done and in some ways it's an artifact of that test that you get a different response which is in the context of you know diabetes would be interpreted as a bad response it might just reflect a different underlying physiological state and i haven't seen anybody really try to address that and what makes me believe that's that might be the case is is you know we and others have seen that rapamycin treatment has pretty profound effects on uh fat mobilization fat metabolism adipogenesis and at higher doses ketogenesis and so it it would not surprise me at all if that metabolic adaptation is accounts for some of the beneficial effects of rapamycin and is also leading to this apparent aberrant response to a glucose tolerance test yeah it's interesting when i i've spoken with one other physician who uses rapamycin although he uses it very liberally in many of his patients i do not um i think his patients are coming in much older and much more metabolically deranged and the results that he's seeing in an uncontrolled manner meaning you simply have no idea what the performance effect of rapamycin is so when you give it to somebody who's expecting to get better they may go and change many other behaviors of course um but you know he's shared with me some of his data and it's quite profound right so you know triglycerides falling from you know unhealthy levels of 200 milligrams per deciliter to 70 milligrams per deciliter you know and actually they're seeing the opposite right they're seeing improved glucose homeostasis again these are people starting who are pre-diabetic and in some cases diabetic and i think your point's a fair one about oral glucose tolerance tests are very unnatural and you you can see a physiologic insulin resistance when you do them on people who are either calorie restricted or carbohydrate restricted right because that initial form of muscle insulin resistance is actually a protective element there so all of that said you've decided to go with once a week rather than daily despite all of the anim other the all of the other animal models that have shown great success with daily dosing is that yeah so there's a couple i i don't know if i would define it as a hedge i mean i think that um so the rationale there uh is both based on the human data which again is limited right but we've talked about the the daily versus uh weekly dosing for immune function and again we've also talked about why i think that readouts of immune function are probably telling us about the underlying inflammatory state which i think is a big part of what rapamycin is doing so so that is suggestive that daily dose weekly dosing is at least as good as daily dosing and it's also suggestive that weekly dosing has fewer side effects and because this is a this is a challenge with human clinical trials as we've already talked about it's also something you have to be you know absolutely aware of when you're talking about doing a clinical trial in in companion dogs right these are people's pets there is an extremely rightly so an extremely low tolerance for significant side effects when we're talking about people's pets right i love my dog and and i would be you know devastated if i hurt anybody else's dog in this clinical trial so you want to do everything you can to reduce the likelihood of side effects and there's reason to believe that once weekly dosing um is is likely to have fewer side effects so and as also the pragmatic aspect of you know we're asking owners to give this medication to their dog in the context of a clinical trial we expect that there will be better compliance and fewer mistakes with once a week dosing versus daily dosing or three times a week so let's pivot a bit from rapa to to tauren two you've recently you and i have shared a couple of emails on this topic tell people a little bit about what that is and why you're excited right so so tauren 2 is a a different uh version of an mtor inhibitor so so we just talked about mtor complex 1 and mtor complex 2 and how rapamycin at least biochemically is a specific inhibitor of mtor complex 1. tauren 2 is a what's called a catalytic inhibitor or an atp competitive inhibitor of mtor which versus what we call allosteric allosteric inhibitor which is rapamycin meaning it interacts not through the catalytic site yes um at least in theory tauren 2 and tauren 1 and other catalytic inhibitors will equally inhibit both mtor complex 1 and mtor complex 2. and for reasons that i still am not sure about as far as i know nobody has tested torin2 torn 1 other catalytic inhibitors for effects on aging in mice um yeah this seems like something that needs to be submitted to itp tomorrow right for next or at least for the next cycle yeah um i don't know i don't know why it hasn't been done to be honest with you uh and maybe it has and i just haven't seen the data that that certainly is possible but i don't think i don't know of any data not just for lifespan but for you know other functional measures of aging i don't know of any data so uh so i don't know that i would say i'm i can tell you why i think there's a there's additional reason to test it beyond you know sort of the rationale that seems obvious but i don't i don't know that i would say i'm excited about torren2 it seems like an obvious gap in knowledge and would be actually a nice way to test the question we were talking about previously of torque 1 versus torque 2 good bad right all of that stuff it seems like an important set of experiments to do and as far as i know nobody's done it so part of the reason additional reason why i think it's an interesting set of experiments to do is you know in addition to studying aging my lab also works on mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial disease and we have worked for many years in a mouse model of a childhood mitochondrial disease called lee syndrome so this mouse is defective in in complex one of the electron transport chain of the mitochondria and it it is very short-lived it lives about 55-60 days and it develops many of the same uh molecular phenotypes and neurological phenotypes as kids who have lee syndrome this childhood mitochondrial disease and and these children typically live how long you know it's variable onset but it's anywhere from infants to you know eight nine years old typically kids with lee syndrome don't make it to be teenagers it's just a it's a horrible horrible disorder um so we found out many years ago that rapamycin could roughly double or triple the survival of these mice and basically prevent the neurodegeneration and brain lesions that that that are thought to limit lifespan in both the mice and the kids with lee syndrome and presumably matt that's that's because when you knock out complex one you're destroying oxidative phosphorylation and uh presumably the neurons are going to be the most sensitive to that yeah is that the same thing it's an interesting question we don't really know i mean i'll tell you what i'll tell you the sort of current thinking in the field so first thing is to recognize is is um this particular component of complex one uh is is uh an accessory stabilizing factor so the mice are not 100 deficient in complex one they have a low level of complex one i think you'd probably be dead if you didn't have any complex one and the same thing's true in the the patients so it's a deficiency in complex one and um you're right so one one idea uh there are actually several reasons why being deficient in complex one could be a problem one could be you just can't generate enough atp and and neurons or a subset of neurons are particularly sensitive right another could be that you're generating high levels of reactive oxygen species we know subsets of neurons are are especially sensitive to that right um uh and you could come up there's also an inflammatory component to this disease where we see a lot of neural inflammation in the brain regions where the lesions occur and we don't quite understand what's causing that inflammation so there are multiple ways that this could be causing you know the symptoms of the of the disease um an interesting body of work from uh the mcmutha's lab and and isha jane who was in his lab and now has her own lab um uh shows that hypoxia can also rescue these mice and hypoxia actually rescues these mice to a greater extent than rapamycin so that at least is consistent with an oxidative stress model right so one idea would be that when you're deficient in complex one those neurons are not using as much oxygen because they've switched over to non-oxidative glycolytic metabolism and fermentation so you have higher oxygen levels in the brain that leads to higher oxidative damage when you reduce oxygen through hypoxia you've suppressed that by the way have you ever tried the experiment where you give them excessive amounts of lactate which neurons like lactate and if you gave them lactate in theory you would also come up with a way to bypass the etc i mean it'd be an interesting control or way to test that we've never tried that so what i can tell you is they have higher levels of lactate in their blood that's common in mitochondrial diseases because they switch over to fermentation um but that doesn't that doesn't mean that your experiment wouldn't work it's just an observation and rapamycin suppresses that high level of lactate interestingly as well as the accumulation of all the glycolytic intermediates upstream of lactate um so uh so anyways oxidative stress is a there's at least some reason to believe that oxidative stress is important another phenotype that these mice get is a dramatic loss of fat so they are extremely lean and rapamycin suppresses that so we we think that there is some we know there's something going on with fat mobilization you know adipogenesis when we treat with rapamycin that spares those mice from presumably using up all their fat right presumably they're trying to burn the fat in some way and that's why they become so lean so that's another obvious observation so how do we get to m torque 2 and and tauren 2. so we did a um a phosphoproteomic study with judith villan who's at the university of washington in genome sciences uh to try to just you know take a sort of a a global picture and ask you know what is the effect of rapamycin on the proteome and the phosphoproteome in uh the knockout mice compared to wild type and then with rapamycin treatment there was a lot of interesting stuff in there this work is published it was published in nature metabolism i don't know several months ago so if people are interested they can look at that paper there's a lot of interesting stuff in that proteomic data set but but one of the striking things that we saw was that mtorq2 components were at the protein level decreased which actually fits with the idea that high-dose rapamycin chronically leads to inhibition of mtor ii um and associated that with that was an inhibition of of protein kinase c which is another kinase that's regulated by mtor complex ii so that led us to hypothesize that and protein kinase c is known to regulate some aspects of inflammation so that led us to hypothesize that maybe some of the effects of rapamycin at least in this mouse model are through protein kinase c and m torque two as opposed to you know what we had assumed was all m torp1 related effects of rapamycin so we tested uh a few drugs that are known um inhibitors of uh protein kinase c and they rescued part of the lifespan of the the mitochondrial disease mice so they weren't as good as rapamycin but they did give significant increases in survival and delayed some of the the neurological symptoms that the mice experience so that is consistent with the idea that this inhibition of mtorq2 inhibition of protein kinase c is part of the effect of rapamycin so now we've gone back and we've tested um tauren ii in this mitochondrial disease model seems to work you know as well as rapamycin which is interesting uh no negative side effects that we can see from inhibiting torque 2 in that context and then we're also working in another another mouse model of a severe metabolic disease and i think i'm not going to talk about it because this is a collaboration and it's not published yet and so i don't want to give away you know what is what the initial observation was really the observation of our collaborators but let me just say in another childhood metabolic disease which is on the surface completely unrelated to complex one of the mitochondria we see dramatic rescue from rapamycin and taurine ii so this makes me wonder first of all i thought for a long time that mitochondrial disease might be a good model for normal aging in some respects we know that i mean we talked about mitochondrial dysfunction as one of the hallmarks of aging so so severe mitochondrial dysfunction i would not argue as accelerated aging but i think interventions that are effective in a model of severe mitochondrial disease might also be effective in the context of normative aging everything we've seen so far is consistent with that and it might it makes me wonder if tauren 2 or other catalytic inhibitors of mtor might be as effective as rapamycin in the context of aging and maybe even more effective in the context of some age-related indications so to me it just seems like a gaping hole in the literature that you know really really needs to be explored and and and um and you know we'll learn from doing that that sort of exploration the other point that's that's interesting to make is rtb 101 the drug we talked about previously in the the restore bio phase three clinical trial is a catalytic inhibitor of mtor as well as other kinases so it would fall at least biochemically into the tauren ii class as opposed to the rapamycin class how is tauren 2 discovered or synthesized what was it uh was it synthesized directly to be a catalytic inhibitor was it discovered and modified i you know david sabatini would be the person to ask i should know the answer to that my my recollection so rapamycin is interesting right that's made by bacteria i think tauren 2 came out of a more traditional sort of chemical screening uh as a mtor inhibitor and then was modified to be a more potent uh catalytic entry inhibitor but i i honestly don't don't know that does it already have an ind is there already a molecule that's in a pipeline than an fda pipeline that's a good question i have looked a little bit and i don't know of anybody who's developing tauren 2 or tauren 1 which is another cadillac inhibitor for fda approval and i i've wondered about this and honestly i just haven't had the bandwidth to really dig into it is it is it because people tried and there were side effects i don't know but i don't know of anybody who's actively developing uh the torrens at least uh for fda approval rtb 101 you know again we talked about that's being developed or has attempted to be developed for fda approval there are other dual kinase inhibitors that are used clinically that hit mtor in addition to other like a pi3 kinase a different class of kinase so there are molecules that have similar types of activity but i don't know of anybody who's really trying hard to develop the more specific um mtor catalytic inhibitors and i'm again i'm not sure why let's change gears for a second and talk about nad nr nmn all these things um i've i've had uh david sinclair on the podcast a couple of times she's very eloquently explained what sirtuins are how they work why they require nad so for for folks who want to get up to speed on that you can do so in great depth do you want to give the 30-second answer as to why certains matter and why they need nad sure but i would start by saying that i'm not sure that that sirtuins are the only or most important reason why nad is important sure sure so certainly sirtuins are a class of nad dependent mostly deacetylases they also can do some other um activities but but basically one way to think about it is that sirtuins uh take acetyl groups off of other proteins that's their activity and that that requires nad and it actually consumes nad so nad is a cofactor for many metabolic reactions where it gets converted between nad which is the oxidized form of the coenzyme and nadh which is the reduced form uh many many different metabolic reactions use nad in that way including the electron transport chain including the electron transport chain and glycolysis and fermentation yes um sirtuins are fundamentally different in that they they use up nad right uh um uh and so nad is required for their activity nadh the reduced form of nad is actually an inhibitor of sirtuins so the nad to nadh ratio can be used as a proxy of of likely sirtuin activity um so sirtuins are are important in the aging field um you know this really goes back to my work as a graduate student in yeast when i was a grad student with lenny guerenti when we first showed that you could over express the yeast sirtuin which is called sir two that's where sirtuin comes from so the yeast protein is called sir two if you over express sir two you increase lifespan and yeast and since then other people have shown that that activation or overexpression of sirtuins and worms or flies or mice can have interesting effects on aging you and david must have overlapped right in the you guys must have both been in lenny's life at the same time overlapped in lenny's lab yeah so he was a post-doc when i was a grad student and i got to give david i mean david and i have had our scientific disagreements over the years um but i got to give david a ton of credit as as a postdoc you know he uh uh mentored me um in important ways and i think actually guided me to the project looking at sir two which is what i just talked about when we overexpressed sir two so so david was a very important early um influence on on my scientific career and and the guarantee lab at that time you know was full of uh really smart i'm sure it's still full of really smart people but it was just a really great environment it was a powerhouse yeah with lots of lots of really um really fantastic scientists um so that was the first and it was really lenny's lab that established sirtuins as important in aging and in multiple model systems so in mice um i mean i think you know david might disagree with this a little bit but i think if you're being honest right the the evidence that sirtuins are potent regulators of lifespan in mice is mixed it's not strong there are a couple of studies out of probably you know a dozen that have been published and there's probably two dozen that are unpublished where people saw no effects on lifespan from manipulator or activating sirtuins there are a couple of studies that show in one case a brain specific activation of one of the sirtuins called certio1 could slightly extend lifespan and another that that over expression of a different sir 2 in 36 could slightly extend lifespan i think only in males but nowhere near the the reproducibility or magnitude of effect of other things including rapamycin so so the data on sirtuins is broad but but the absolute effects on on lifespan at least are in my personal view unconvincing like it hasn't been broadly replicated like rapamycin has and they're not big what we do see with sirtuins is abundant evidence that that metabolic markers of health can be improved by activating sirtuins and in a few other disease specific models pretty good evidence heart disease in particular some evidence for cognitive function as well improvements in age-related outcomes so there's a lot of smoke there but i think i think you know p there's a lot of confusion in the field about the relative strength of data for different interventions and at least in my view you know there's really no comparison between the effects you get from inhibiting mtor and the effects at least so far that people have reported from from activating circuits mtor is head and shoulders above sirtuins when it comes to magnitude of effect yeah i i think it would be impossible to dispute that i i don't think there could be any dispute of that what's interesting is if i were to tally up the number of questions i get per month about nr and nmn versus rapid logs the the the ratio is the exact opposite to the magnitude so if the effect size of rapamycin and the importance of mtor is 10x that of sirtuins it's flipped in the number of questions i get um about it and and just the you know the the pop culture awareness of of of that so let's put the the marketing of that aside and talk about the chemistry of it for a moment sure so i think um right so sirtuins are nad dependent enzymes right so they need nad to do their action and we've already talked about in general the model is that turning up sirtuins is is a good thing right that you're going to get if you're going to get benefits in the context of aging that's going to happen from activating sirtuins again that's a probably a pretty massive oversimplification because there are seven sirtuins right and they do different things and different things in different tissues but that's kind of where the field has gotten stuck right the idea is that activating sirtuins is good and so if you accept that and you and nad is an activator of sirtuins then more nad is good and there's there's good evidence that nad homeostasis becomes impaired with aging that that the ratio of nad to nadh the oxidized to reduced form of nad in many tissues at least shifts towards more nadh and less nad right and so that with age and so the prediction would be that you would have declining sirtuin activity due to that metabolic shift and i will also note because i think this is important that in mitochondrial disease you see the same shift it's just much much more pronounced you see a shift towards nadh and less nad and that's exactly what you see when mitochondria are less functional because the cells will switch over to glycolysis and fermentation right fermentation to lactate and the whole reason why we ferment to lactate is to restore nad levels right fermentation to lactate takes nadh and turns it back into nad so it this probably reflects an underlying metabolic defect which could be mitochondrial in origin that leads to this shift towards towards the reduced form of nad with age so so those two observations less nad right bad sirtuin's good the prediction is that that if we could boost nad that would be good because that would then restore sirtuin activity and have effects on aging and so this led to the the development and popularization of of these molecules called nad precursors or nad boosters the two of which get talked about the most are nicotinamide riboside and nr that was kind of the first to uh to gain popularity and then nicotinamide mononucleotide nmn both of those are precursors of nad that within cells can be converted into nad and so you know there's there's a there's a large body of literature uh in a variety of model organisms showing that treatment with na nr or nmn sometimes leads to benefits that are associated with healthy aging and in one study uh lifespan extension in mice i say sometimes because there's also a large body of literature that doesn't reproduce those results including the itp including the itp that's right which is what i think has to be considered the gold standard for at least mice data i think that's true although you know as we talked about before it's a different genetic background than than c57 black sex right and i would argue it's a much better genetic background i think i think well i think you can make that argument and um there are good reasons to uh to believe that argument um nonetheless i i think i i think it's important to note right that that could be why it worked in one context absolutely and we've struggled with this as well in my lab so you know it's been reported in this mitochondrial disease mouse by a collaborator of ours who i i trust their data right that that nmn could increase lifespan in that mouse model we've tried multiple times with both nr and nmn in that mouse model and been unable to to get these effects so i think these drugs are tricky uh from a from a biological efficacy perspective to there's something we don't understand about delivery or or uptake uh that do you think they're temperature stable probably well i mean i i don't know um i'm sure i'm sure there are people who know the answer to that um i've read conflicting things right i've read that and i i need to go back to the sources on it but i've read that at least through the lens in which they're provided as supplements the likelihood that by the time that thing arrives at your door it still has the biologic activity that it would have had in a refrigerated manner is low now i don't know that the companies that sell them recommend refrigerating them but they might not recommend refrigerating them because then it would imply that they're being shipped in an unrefrigerated manner which sort of nullifies the whole benefit but right right i don't know if you if you've looked at any of that we haven't um so i think so definitely in our mouth studies we are careful to keep the food in the in the refrigerator until we put it in the mouse cage um i s you know i i suspect that uh that there certainly is it might be some truth to the idea that the biological activity goes off over time at room temperature um but i think that reflects a bigger problem with the nad precursor field which is that you know there's a lot of controversy even among the two camps so i mean it's sort of funny right because there's an nr camp of researchers who really you know think nr is the the tool that we should use and then there's an nmn camp and they both you know say that the other camp that their molecule doesn't work right because it's not biologically available or you know all sorts of reasons right so there's a lot of lack of clarity around biological availability and efficacy with these molecules in the pre-clinical literature right where you know in theory people should be able to exactly reproduce the way that other people do the work and get the same results right there are lots of reasons why scientific results don't get replicated it's my impression that in the nad precursor field that's a bigger problem than in some other areas and i don't know the reasons for that but all i can say is we've experienced that in my lab as well um so so i you know i've tried to stay on the fence here because i think there's a ton of smoke right there's a ton of smoke with sirtuins there's a ton of smoke with nad precursors that they can if you do the experiment the right way have positive effects that look a lot like what we would expect for something that's impacting the aging process and as i said i mean it's funny because you know people who are in the field i think sometimes think of me as this anti-sertuin guy which is absolutely not the truth i'm the guy i'm the guy who first showed that you could over express a certain and increased lifespan if anybody's going to be pro certain it's me i think the problem is that i've seen a lot of data that has that people have struggled to reproduce right and and i and i just honestly don't know how to interpret that whereas with rapamycin it works for everybody right it's robust and everybody gets the same result over and over and over again so i'm less enthusiastic i would say about sirtuins and nad precursors as as opposed to some other interventions right in the in the field but i think there's a lot of data um that suggests that that these molecules and the sirtuins are important for aging i think what what we haven't done yet is figured out how to tweak the system in exactly the right way to get robust and reproducible experimental results that i personally would feel comfortable moving forward with clinically and it might be that the answer is you have to hit this system with two-pronged you have to provide more of the precursor and you have to activate the sirtuin in the way that resveratrol attempted to do but wasn't doing right so maybe the answer is it's both again that that's that's literally just that's a possibility yeah the other thing that i find weird about the nad precursor um literature and the the limited work that's been done clinically is often i mean in principle it should be trivial to determine whether or not you have boosted nad levels right if you treat somebody with an nad precursor we know how to measure nad that's not hard okay so we know what the biomarker is at least that far in this case and oftentimes that's not done so so you know if you're treating somebody with nr or nmn and you're not increasing nad levels in the blood or in your target tissue that should tell you something important i would think well the other question is is increasing it in the blood sufficient that's a different question but it is an important question i agree that's why i said target tissue and we can't biopsy certain tissues but we can biopsy some tissues yeah no it's it's it's super messy uh look i get asked about it at least once a week by patients and i usually point them to something i've written on the subject matter but in the end i say look i will say i think it's very safe i really don't see a downside other than to your pocketbook of taking nr or nmn um i think they're so so they check the first box of any intervention which is is the downside sufficiently low and i think the answer is yes i'm just having a hard time seeing upside so yeah and i'll tell you honestly i would love to test nr or nmn or both in dogs for exactly that reason right because there is there is essentially no risk um and we could actually find out does it work you know three years from now five years from now i could tell you do nad precursor slow aging at least in pet dogs and i think if i saw if i saw nr slow aging increase lifespan and or improve multiple functional measures of aging in dogs i'd be i'd be much more bullish on taking nr myself wouldn't prove it's going to work in people but it yeah gets you gets you you know part part way there and a pretty big part of the way there um and i would put that on the short list of things i would like to test the fact is nobody's going to do the definitive clinical trial in people because they don't have to because they can sell that stuff to people now right they don't they aren't required to do the clinical trial to show that it works yep matt you don't you probably don't remember this but there was one night oh four four five years ago are you making comments about my cognitive decline with aging [Laughter] i just don't think you'd remember some random night of us having dinner in new york but it was about four years with you yes okay wow you do have the cognitive function so the three of us were having dinner at my favorite not my favorite but a decent persian place uh on the upper east side and i don't know if i said so at the time but i may have told you after it was after that dinner that i decided i gotta do a podcast because the three of us had such an enjoyable she's at einstein isn't she she was yeah she's actually moved to columbia so now she's running a reproductive aging center at columbia now apropos with our discussion today right but we just had such an amazing discussion uh which really means me asking the two of you guys non-stop questions and i remember thinking after that god damn why didn't i record this dinner why didn't i have my phone sitting on the table to record it and it was literally that moment that made me realize like this happens the same time every time i go out with sabatini i have the same feeling every time i go out with so and so i have the same feeling i gotta just do this podcast thing so for anybody listening to this who is appreciative of the podcast they owe you personally a great debt of gratitude for always providing i got to say i'm sure it was you shin who made most of the the really insightful comments at that dinner i think it was both of you guys but but it was um you know it is always such an awesome time to be able to sit down with you i think as the listener appreciates here the the breadth of topics within the space of longevity uh that you can cover as broad so you're one of the few people who can go very wide and very deep um and i think uh today's discussion demonstrated that so so thank you very much matt uh really has always enjoyed this discussion sure yeah any time i i enjoy the discussion as much as you do i think so um it's been a lot of fun all right and best of luck with the the triad study i know a lot of people are probably more interested in that than any of the human stuff because the dog owners i know care far more about what rapamycin can do for their dogs than they care about what it can do for them so hopefully we'll have those results by the next time we speak thank you for
