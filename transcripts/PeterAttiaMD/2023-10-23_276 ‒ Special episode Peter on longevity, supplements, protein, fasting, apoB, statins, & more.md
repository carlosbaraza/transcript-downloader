[00:00:00] if you knew that this was as good as it was going to get and I don't think it is by the way I do think there are incremental things that are going to make a difference even in the lives of people my age but if you thought that look this is directionally as good as it were going to get I think it would motivate you to be more serious about using the tools that we have today for primary and secondary prevention of disease for optimizing and maximizing uh lifespan and health span and if for no other reason you would do that as a hedge against the enormously long odds that something dramatic and miraculous is going to happen in the next decade or two hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia

[00:00:54] all right Peter welcome to a special podcast how you doing doing pretty good good so today's episode we're going to do something a little different it's going to be kind of like an AMA style where you're the one answering questions but it's going to be an episode that's available to everyone we've done this a few times in the past usually our strong convictions Lucy held episodes celebrating the 100 200 episodes those are just receive really good feedback and so what we decided to do was do another type of those episodes but instead pull some of the most frequently asked questions that have come through the site and so we organized them a little bit by like various topics but this is going to be an episode that's kind of more old school style where it's just question answer a lot of these questions you haven't seen before which is probably good because some of them you've always refused to talk about on AMA such as what supplements do you take

[00:01:57] I know it's not your favorite subject to go into those details so we're going to get into them today which I think will be good um and I think it should just be a fun conversation where you're kind of coming into this blind and it should be really interesting I think for the listener and viewer so with that said anything you want to add before we get started why do people care what supplements I take we can save that for the question but we will we will get to it and I think people will find it enjoyable but the other thing I should say is do you know why I'm also excited to have this conversation today of all days with you no as our friend Kyler Brown would say based on some emails we've exchanged earlier you kind of seem like you're in a spicy mood today so I think it's going to be kind of fun to go through these questions what do you think I think I am in a very spicy mood so for the listener and viewer this should be a fun one all around so with that said first question when people think of longevity a lot of times in the space they think of living to 120 150 200 years old

[00:03:14] I think anyone who's listened to your podcast listened to or read the book list interviews you've done you're not really in that camp of very confident that we're going to live to 120 150 years old one of the common questions we get is just Why is that why do you think that's maybe not possible and the follow-up would be based on that why do you think it's important to act and live like we might only get to 90 years old so I mean uh this is a bit of a complicated question I think so why do I not have confidence in the sort of biohacking your way to 120 150 180 I've heard all of these sorts of numbers um because I don't think we have the tools to address the underlying aspects of the Aging of biology that are kind of relentlessly pushing us towards the end of our lives again that's not a depressing statement

[00:04:21] I think it's just an obvious reality right so there are there are things about us as we age that we we have the capacity to reduce the rate of change on we can slow them down but I've seen no real evidence that we can reverse them in a meaningful way now it's true that there are some people out there claiming that you know they've got their aging clock and it shows that even though their birth certificate says they're 60 they're really 35. we could we could we could put some time into explaining why that's not correct um so the the long and short of it is we we don't have any evidence that we can take the diseases of aging and erase them or that we can take the underlying processes of you know everything from uh you know defects in mitochondrial function defects in you know protein folding and misfolding changes in DNA

[00:05:35] DNA breaking and and repair breakdown in nutrient sensing all of these Pathways I just haven't seen any evidence that we can undo that so then what would you have to believe so if you're going to believe that someone my age I.E someone who's 50 is going to be around in 70 years you have to believe that in the next dozen years or so someone is going to come up with a way to completely halt aging and or reverse it right so you know in other words or you know because it's not it's not going to do me any good if this happens 50 years from now because in 50 years I probably won't be here um and I spend a lot of time looking at this type of literature I really do spend a lot of time looking at this technology and I've I haven't seen many examples where there's a bigger mismatch between what is actually happening scientifically and what is being talked about in the Press on social media on podcasts and that Chasm is enormous in other words what's really happening is like nowhere near the Sci-Fi that's being portrayed so um because of that and because I have confidence that what's actually happening is more a representation of reality um I know that these things are not you know a decade away um so so that that's why I take that point of view now why does all of this matter I think this matters because if you knew that this was as good as it was going to get and I don't think it is by the way I do think there are incremental things that are going to make a difference even in the lives of people my age but if you thought that look this is directionally as good as it were going to get I think it would motivate you to be more serious about using the tools that we have today four primary and secondary prevention of disease for optimizing and maximizing lifespan and health span and if for no other reason you would do that as a hedge against the enormously long odds that something dramatic and miraculous is going to happen in the next decade or two and to double click on a few things there when you were talking early on about diseases were those diseases what you call the four horsemen from your book is that what you're referring to

[00:08:07] Yes again we you still have to have a strategy that says how are you not going to die of ascvd cancer neurodegeneration dementia and of all of those diseases the only one where I can see a pretty clear path to delay it significantly it would be ascvd if you take really dramatic Steps early in life right so instead of talking about what we think of as primary prevention think of like sort of

[00:08:41] Ultra primary prevention right you know treating people in their 30s now making sure a person never ever walks around with an apob over 30 or 40 milligrams per deciliter making sure a person doesn't even spend one year with mild hypertension making sure a person is always metabolically healthy if you do that

[00:09:00] I agree you would not get atherosclerosis in a normal lifespan um but we don't have that degree of certainty for pushing off cancer indefinitely for pushing off neurodegeneration indefinitely for pushing off dementia indefinitely nor do we have it by the way for pushing off I think sarcopenia indefinitely are pushing off arthritis indefinitely I mean there's these other conditions that are not as interesting to think about because they don't rise to the level of the horsemen but they matter a lot so physical Frailty is a really really really big one again I I I think there's if you you know if you manage to not die of of heart disease cancer or neurodegeneration dementia and you're willing to train really hard like I really do think there's a path to be physically robust as a centenarian but I don't I don't see a path to doing that at 120 or 150 unless there is a significant Technologic breakthrough that would basically allow us to rewind um that and maybe this is a different discussion and maybe it's a longer discussion Nick and I don't know if we want to go into it because it's a little it's getting a little off topic but it really gets into what does it mean to age at a cellular level and what you know what is the role of the epigenome in regulating our genetic code but we can we can maybe I don't know if there are other questions about that topic but we could certainly we can certainly defer to that yeah and we can you know on that topic I know that's talked a little bit about in the episode with

[00:10:41] David sabatini Matt cable and and so maybe we'll pull questions from there and do a future AMA kind of diving into that a little deeper and so kind of what I'm hearing you say is you still think that we will succumb to the same diseases that will kill us your goal with medicine 3.0 and prevention is still to put that off as far as possible but that doesn't mean you're going to put it off until you're 120 years old the goal is to really live as robustly as possible and avoid those as long as you can but still kind of more in the traditional lifespan opposed to the 150 year old lifespan yeah I mean I I think that taking all of the steps that I talk about in in the book and you know could seriously add a decade to life there's I don't I don't doubt that you can live a decade a decade and a half maybe two decades longer I don't doubt that but I don't think we're talking about adding you know 30 years or 50 years to lifespan what I think is more important is that whether you're adding five years seven years or ten years to your lifespan what I think is much more interesting and much more important is reducing or compressing the period of morbidity late in life and what I think people should fixate on is how do I not be really really frail both physically and cognitively in the last decade of my life what I call the marginal decade and I think you know I don't know I don't know if

[00:12:17] I'm going to live till I'm 85 or 90 or 80 or whatever I mean I don't I don't feel like I have as much control over that I think there are some elements of bad luck that factor into that what I feel like I have much more control over is when I'm in my marginal decade can I still go for a rock no will I carry 80 pounds on said Rock no way but I might be able to carry 10 or 20. will I be able to swim half a mile in a pool yeah will I be able to swim in as fast as I can now no chance but I could still swim half a mile and get out of the pool under my own power could I sit on the floor you know it's all those things that I talk about in the

[00:12:57] Centenary in decathlon those are the things I think that we really want to relentlessly fixate on because I think most people would rather live to 90 and you know die of a heart attack while swimming in the ocean but being you know otherwise in remarkable shape then live to 120 and spend the last 30 years of that unable to do much and earlier you also mentioned there's incremental things you think that could happen that will help someone even your age at 50 live longer do you want to just lightly touch on what a few of those things are that you were talking about there yeah I think one of the most interesting and I talked about this on a recent podcast with with David sabatini and Matt caberlin is I still think we are really in early days of understanding what pharmacologic inhibition of mtor can do again there's really a lot of promise with this approach in virtually every other model species outside of humans and that doesn't mean it will work in humans but it's very interesting and I think if we had better biomarkers which again I think that's something that can happen in our lifetime I I think that's a very promising strategy and it's especially promising when you consider that the animal models show that M pharmacologic inhibition of mtor using rapamycin or its analogs even applied late in life still provided lifespan and health span Improvement and why that's interesting is very few other interventions that have shown to be zero protective work when applied that late in life so that to me is very promising last question on this aging topic would be let's take someone who's listening maybe your age but they have a son or a daughter who is 10 years old how do you think that 40-year time scale differs as you look at a 10 year old's potential lifespan today compared to your 50 year old lifespan today that's a good question I don't know and I you know look I'm that guy right I mean I have a six-year-old a nine-year-old a 15 year old and I often think about what's the difference between me and them in terms of their Runway versus mine vis-a-vis the types of Technologic breakthroughs that we're interested in and again the one that I'm most interested in is is probably on you know selective and High Fidelity High Precision modulation of the epigenome um I don't know the answer truthfully I

[00:15:44] I simply don't have a way to predict the pace of that type of innovation um and of course not to be a doomsdayer but even though they have a longer Horizon for good things to happen they also have a long Horizon for bad things to happen and when I think about bad things that can happen to our kids of course you can't help but think about nuclear war you can't help but think about and by the way in order how would I rank them I don't know probably I would say biological terrorism would be the single greatest threat to to our species simply based on the low barriers to entry um and the ease with which there's proliferation but again you could sit here and debate what's the greater threat to our species um you know is it nuclear war is it climate change is it biological warfare the point being here they have just as much time to be exposed to really bad things that could obliterate our species as good things that could extend the life of our species so I don't know how

[00:16:48] I just don't know how to handicap the the pros and cons on that that could be your next book we could call it the fifth Horseman and it could be all about that um so that's a good intro into this next section which gets into drugs and supplements and the most common questions we get asked there but I think you mentioned one thing in the agent section that I think would be worth touching on real quick because it I think it will affect what we talk about here which is we really don't have biomarkers for aging and you've been open about frustrations with that because when you look at geoprotective molecules and you look at if these things are working or not we really don't know because we don't have those biomarkers so do you maybe want to talk about that for just a minute to kind of set the stage so when people hear you're framing for everything else I think it will make a little more sense yeah I think one of the most important things to understand when you're using some sort of intervention is do you have a biomarker to know if you're doing it correctly so think of like really basic things that most people don't even consider as interventions like nutrition so how would you know if you're eating too much do you have a biomarker for it sure there are lots right one biomarker might be your weight another biomarker might be your waist circumference another biomarker might be your insulin level your glucose level your average glucose I mean you know you get deeper and deeper down this and you start to realize that how much you eat you have a way of getting feedback from this system that tells you do you need to correct this the same is true for exercise the same is true for sleep so you know there might not be a lab value that is specific to sleep but there are clearly ways to get feedback to know if you're sleeping too much or not sleeping enough so now if you think about it through the lens of you know taking exogenous molecules so um you take a drug like lysinopril right an

[00:19:05] Ace inhibitor for lowering blood pressure how do you know if you're taking the right amount well you measure your blood pressure and let's say you get started on a dose of lysinopril when your starting blood pressure was 135 over 85 and all of a sudden it's 1 15 over 75. that says the drug is working are you symptomatic by the way that's another biomarker in a sense no you're not lightheaded great everybody wins the game if your blood pressure goes too low and or you're symptomatic which is probably the bigger issue then you're taking too much you have to dial the drug back if you're taking the drug and your blood pressure comes down but doesn't come down enough that's more feedback dial the drug up so you have this sort of input output ability with every drug that we like to think of again the same is true with drugs for diabetes with drugs for lipids with you know cancer drugs that you take you would be able to look and study is the tumor shrinking is the tumor growing so you have somebody getting feedback well the problem when it comes to zero protection this broad category where we are not targeting diseases specifically but instead we're targeting the underlying mechanisms of Aging is we can't measure it we don't have a way to measure it so we take a drug we take a supplement that we believe is zero protective and we don't know if it's working are we taking enough are we taking too much maybe if you're really lucky you might find a side effect that tells you you're taking too much but do we really want to be in the game of pushing things to the point of seeing overt side effects so so that's why I believe as unsexy as the world of Diagnostics and biomarkers are and it is a very very unsexy world I mean this is not a place where people like investing money this is not a place where there's an enormous amount of capital being thrown at the problem it is a very important problem and it's going to be very important in humans if we're interested in studying zero protection and I probably the very first time I went on kind of a long diatribe on this was back when I was really really obsessed with trying to understand the perfect routine for fasting and I'm sure you can recall this sort of

[00:21:27] Circa 2018 2019-2020 I was very frustrated that as as much as I was trying to study this in myself and doing every part every sort of blood analysis Under the Sun I had no way of knowing if my My fasting protocol of you know seven to ten days of water only once a quarter three days once a month was that too much was that too little was that doing anything was I mean no idea to this day

[00:21:56] I have no idea if that provided any benefit at all um I could certainly point to some negative things it did right it cost me probably 20 pounds of muscle over six years um but maybe that was a worthwhile trade-off given some other benefits but how would I know don't know what the benefits are don't know how to measure it so um it's it's a very important problem and it's one that I hope more and more resources will be poured into because otherwise it's going to be very difficult for us to kind of move further in understanding what works in humans and on that I do actually have another framework question which before we get to the list of supplements which I know people are anxious to get to you've often talked about your analogy of are you picking up a gold coin or a penny are you picking up in front of a train or a tricycle and oftentimes when I've heard you use this it's a lot of times as it relates to interventions specifically drugs and supplements do you maybe want to kind of just quickly give people what that framework is because I think it is really important based on everything you said which is a lot of this is kind of a guessing game and we don't really know so we kind of need to Anchor it to another framework to try and figure out what are the risks and what are the potential rewards as we try and figure out within ourselves what are we willing to do and not do yeah it's it's nothing more than a very simple Matrix of risk and reward which

[00:23:25] I'm sure anybody would would easily be able to walk themselves through all I do is just to make it easy to remember I just put very obvious concrete examples in the corners of the Matrix right so it doesn't matter which axis is horizontal or vertical but if you just say that the horizontal axis represents risk going from low to high and the vertical axis represents reward going from low to high you would say okay at a very extreme level low risk is bending down in front of an oncoming tricycle and as you move from left to right on that horizontal axis it goes to getting in front of a train you know jumping in front of a train track and grabbing something and then getting off the train track right so that's going from low risk to high risk and in terms of reward you would think of a penny being pretty low reward and you'd think of a big fat juicy gold coin being very high reward so as you go from higher risk you would expect and demand higher reward so I'll tell you a story I'm embarrassed to say this because it speaks to just how stupid teenage boys are and how much of a miracle it is that our species still exists with the utter lack of judgment that that exists in in the presence of young boys so when I was in high school one of our favorite games to play was when we would get off the train we would immediately jump under the train and see who could lay the most coins on the train track and then get out as quickly as possible so that once the train started rolling you could see how many coins got flattened like just think about the abject stupidity of this game another game that was tragically very popular when I was young was playing

[00:25:32] Chicken in front of the subway in Toronto who could be the last guy out and very sadly the younger brother of one of my friends in high school did not make it out he was killed by a Subway playing a stupid game of chicken talk about incredibly high risk for no reward so how do we apply that to you know interventions and I guess we're talking about this through the lens of supplements well

[00:26:05] I think we have to acknowledge that there's a great uncertainty with many of these things and therefore we should ask ourselves like how can we handicap the risk based on human data animal data safety data efficacy data as far as reward and where on that Matrix do we place this intervention so if you're going to take

[00:26:30] I don't know fill in the blank some fancy supplement that some internet Guru is telling you like he's making with his own proprietary blend of crushed bird feathers and you know testicular juice okay I mean do you want to take that risk because it's hard for me to imagine the reward is really there so so that's just kind of like one of the things I will push my patients on is when they show me their laundry list of supplements

[00:26:59] I I walk them through a framework about thinking through it and and one of them is you know where are you on the risk Matrix and where are you on the where are you on the risk reward Matrix so with that said let's get into Peter attius list of supplements that he takes you can pick whichever one you want to start with yeah for for some reason I hate talking about this only because I notice that it tends to show up online and it somehow becomes like

[00:27:28] I don't know like uh well if Peter does this this is you know you should do this or something like that and and you know there's no context to it and therefore nobody understands the rationale nobody understands the clinical history and all of those things so um so with that caveat which I don't think matters because I just at the end of the day don't think people care I think a lot of people just are sort of searching but I take um EPA and DHA so I take fish oil um again I'm happy to even State the brands that I take of these things because I don't have any affiliation with any of these companies and frankly

[00:28:09] I like to give a shout out to to companies that I think sell good products so I use Carlson's EPA and DHA um I can't remember exactly which one I take I can never remember their names they're so convoluted it's like super EPA or something but it is the highest EPA version that they have so by taking four of these capsules a day I'm taking roughly 2 grams of EPA a day and probably a gram and a half of DHA the reason I take that much is I'm treating to uh dose I'm treating to a red blood cell membrane concentration of

[00:28:48] EPA and DHA of about 12 so that's a blood test you would do to so there you go you have a biomarker where that I can use to say I'm taking too much I'm taking too little here you go um I take vitamin D I'm sorry that I'm blanking on the brand I I can see the bottle but I'm blanking on the brand I take 5000 IU of vitamin D why um largely because this is one of those things where

[00:29:19] I think the risk is insanely low I think this is really a tricycle and I'm not sure what I'm picking up I think it's more than a penny I definitely think it's less than a gold coin it might be you know a five dollar bill but I'd pick up a five if I was walking down the street and there was a kid riding a trifle towards me and I saw a five dollar bill I would pick it up um I think that most of the studies on vitamin D have been very poorly done and we do need to do a podcast on this maybe this is something we could Deep dive onto in an AMA um so I won't get into it more now but having looked very critically at the vitamin D literature which is insanely underwhelming um I think it is almost assuredly the result of very lousy studies that add no value to our understanding of the problem so the dosing has been wrong the duration has been wrong the compliance has been wrong and the targeting has been wrong so so they've just everything has been blown and so I would say we have we truly have no idea okay um um I take slow mag that is a brand and I take two or three of those every day so that is a slowly and completely absorbed form of magnesium all in all I'm trying to get up to about a gram of total magnesium or Elemental magnesium in my system a day and I get that through again through slow mag through magnesium L3 and 8 and through magnesium oxide so I take all of those things um let's see what else do I take oh I take methylfolate and methyl B12 I use gero as a brand um again here we do have biomarkers you can measure B12 levels but more than anything I'm measuring homocysteine levels that's why I'm taking methylated versions of those um and basically I take these to keep homocysteine below nine and that for me just means just taking one a day so I take the standard dose of that they do make it in two strengths and I take the lower of the two in part because my my

[00:31:37] MTHFR Gene most of us have sort of variants of MTHFR the variance I have uh are reasonable at methylation um oh this is actually an interesting change um I used to take 50 milligrams of B6 daily I've now lowered that to three times a week um we have seen some people who when they take too much B6 can actually develop a a a a a sort of neuropathy as a result of it although I've never experienced any symptoms from it um a little further digging has has led me to realize we're probably we don't need nearly as much B6 as I thought we did so I've lowered that to 50 milligrams three times a week and it helps with the homocysteine you just have to be careful that you're not overdoing it [Music] um

[00:32:36] I take a baby aspirin a day um I think the evidence for the use of baby aspirin in cardio protection is pretty weak this is this is kind of a soft call I I don't think there's an evidence-based reason why I should take a baby aspirin and there's even some evidence to suggest that once you get significantly older unless your risk of cardiovascular disease is significantly

[00:33:06] High the benefits of it which are clear there's no doubt there are benefits of a baby aspirin but they're outweighed by the the bleeding risks that are associated with aspirin use in particular if you fall and hit your head that becomes a bigger liability this is one of those things that baby aspirin use Falls in and out of favor over time given that I am a very young relatively speaking to these study populations and not really at risk for a bleeding injury I think of this as picking up you know like a dollar or two dollars in front of a tricycle at this point but again I'm always happy to reevaluate the use of this and any supplement for that matter in the presence of new data um you know it's just I'm like physically trying to picture my medicine cabinet um

[00:34:04] I'm going through daytime first because I know it I can remember the night ones are easier um that might be it for daytime supplements um in the night I take um ashwagandha I take 600 uh milligrams of ashwagandha I recently switched to the solgar brand I take two grams of glycine I use the thorn brand

[00:34:37] I take magnesium L3 and 8 which I just mentioned I used the mag team brand by the way anytime you're buying magnesium L3 and 8 just make sure it has mag team in it so you could buy it from any different company but they have to have the mag team proprietary combination because they're the only people that have the license to make L3 and 8. uh I feel like there's one other thing I take um occasionally for travel I will take

[00:35:11] Gyros phosphatidylserine it comes in 100 milligram capsules or gel caps for some reason I like the gel caps better no idea if they're just more quickly absorbed I truly have no idea and I'll take if I'm on if I'm really you know going to the trouble of taking it I'm presumably on a long flight where I'm trying to overcome a significant time zone so I'll usually take about 400 milligrams uh that's a that's a compound that's been tested readily up to 600 milligrams it's possible I'm forgetting something else but I think those are I think those are my supplements oh I mean uh sorry there's two others I take but they're not in the cabinet and that's why so I take athletic Greens in the morning disclosure I am an investor in that company I'm also an advisor to that company um so I take ag1 as a green drink in the morning and I take a probiotic called glucose I think it's called glucose control by a company called pendulum so I take two of those in the morning with my AG that's kind of like the first thing I consume in the morning and with those just on the whole just because you take them not everyone should take them and you're looking at your medical history well what percent of that let's say the same drugs the same supplements and the same doses were you taking a year ago kind of the question I'm kind of getting at yeah yeah so that way if someone listening to this down the road hears it they don't automatically just go do the same thing yeah so a year ago I was not taking the pendulum probiotic that's something I've only been taking for a couple of months and I'm doing an experiment there which is looking at average blood glucose so the reason I'm taking this particular probiotic is I believe having looked at all of these probiotics I think this is the most rigorously tested and validated um probiotic out there and in a small but double-blinded randomized clinical trial it demonstrated a 0.6 percent meaning 0.6 absolute percentage Point reduction in hemoglobin A1c in people with type 2 diabetes that's that and that was only in 90 days which is pretty interesting it also uh was was um associated with um or I would say more than associated with it demonstrated and caused about a 30 reduction in postprandial glucose AUC area under the curve so meaning when you gave people a glucose Challenge and then measured and plotted a graph of their glucose response and look at the area under that curve the people who had been taking this pendulum glucose control probiotic had a 30 reduction in that meaning they had become more insulin sensitive and [Music] um

[00:38:11] I'm you know a couple I don't know a couple weeks away from doing a blood test on myself to see if I've had any Improvement in glycemic markers in response to that so was not taking that a year ago um I was not taking ashwagandha a year ago um I had taken it a long time earlier but sort of just kind of came back to it probably found a slightly more potent version of it um

[00:38:46] I was taking a different brand of fish oil before I had used Carlson's in the past had switched to Nordic Naturals now I've switched back to this I find it to be just a slightly more robust product the Nordic Naturals ones for some reason every third bottle had a broken capsule in it and once a capsule breaks in the bottle it just totally destroys the remaining of the capsules was it was just happening too frequently I was kind of aggravated by it [Music] um

[00:39:20] I don't think I was taking a baby aspirin a year ago I think again that's something I've kind of done on and off over periods of time and probably the same with vitamin D it's possible I wasn't taking vitamin D A year ago yeah so it's not only the drugs have changed but even like the B6 you mentioned the dosing has also changed right um so then if we look at outside of supplements and we kind of look at drugs

[00:39:46] I mean the most common drug we had asked about would be rapamycin kind of followed by metformin and we won't get into those too much here because of that podcast with David and Matt and then also we won't get into too much on Metformin because you and Andrew did a journal club and you kind of focus on that foreman and so just for time's sake well kind of Punt those to those other resources but outside of that the question around drugs that we can ask the most is kind of within the ascvd and you mentioned earlier that's a disease that you think we have some chance to really stop it and to really delay the onset of it if we take early interventions and one of the most common questions we get is how do you lower your APO B and what's realistic with and without pharmacology you know without pharmacology so so first of all exercise has no meaningful impact on on ascvd risk factors through lipoproteins it does in other ways but if you're just talking about managing lipoprotein risk it really comes down to pharmacology hands down the most potent way to do it and then nutrition a far less potent but not insignificant way to do it on the nutrition front you basically have two levers to pull you can dramatically reduce carbohydrates which will lower triglycerides and all things equal the lower triglycerides the lower the APO B burden because you have to traffic fewer triglycerides with the cholesterol the other way to do it is dramatically cut saturated fat which will uh do two things it will reduce cholesterol synthesis and it will reduce the liver's need to keep fat out of the liver by well so it's easier to describe it the other way in a high saturated fat diet what typically happens in addition to an increase in cholesterol synthesis is the liver suit through something called the sterile regulatory binding protein um says I don't need any more fat brought in I don't need any more cholesterol brought in so it down regulates LDL receptors so it pulls fewer LDL out of circulation and LDL will Skyrocket so the reverse is true if you cut saturated fat the liver is going to want more LDL coming in it will upregulate LDL receptors and pull more

[00:42:17] LDL out of circulation so if you were on a really low carbohydrate really low saturated fat diet you would indeed lower your APO B would you lower it to the levels that I think are necessary to make ascvd irrelevant most people probably not um and then would that be a diet that for most people is sustainable long term you know that's probably a very individual decision so for someone like me who has very low triglycerides I don't eat that much that I don't go out of my way to eat saturated fat but I'm also not like restricting it either I would say I probably am in line with sort of where the average person is my APO B at a baseline would still be

[00:43:06] I don't know 90 to 100 milligrams per deciliter which puts me at about the 50th percentile of the population so that's my normal APO B um that's far far too high for someone who a has genetic predisposition to asevd and B just somebody who wants to take the one Horseman that can be taken off the table and take it off the table so my target for APO B is 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter obviously that for therefore that would require pharmacology and so I take three drugs to do that I take a pcsk9 inhibitor um called rapatha and I take a combo drug called Next lazette which is bamfidoic acid and acetamide combined into a single pill and um the mechanism of action of acetamide is that it blocks the um well not to get too technical but it blocks the Neiman pick C1 like one transporter in both hepatocytes and enterocytes of the gut it prevents non-esterified cholesterol from coming back into the gut after you've recirculated it through your liver and into bile so it prevents you from reabsorbing your cholesterol of the three drugs I'm taking that's far and away the least potent bentonoic acid is a pro drug what that means is by itself it is inactive so when you ingest it it goes to the liver it gets activated and there it is a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor it acts on a different enzyme from statins and what makes bentoic acid special for lack of a better word is that it only inhibits cholesterol synthesis in the liver whereas statins which are very potent Inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis they do so throughout the body because they don't have this pro-drug trick um when the liver senses less cholesterol it increases LDL receptor expression on its surface and pulls more LDL out of circulation so that's how both statins and bebedoic acid work they work indirectly the difference is pepedoic acid is less potent than a Statin and more selective in that way so the combination of those three drugs uh will will keep my APO B negligible and more importantly or at least I would say equally importantly there are no side effects associated with that for me personally and again when it comes to lipid management it's certainly one of my favorite topics I always tell patients we have tools today that we couldn't even fathom 20 years ago 20 years ago if you needed to have your APO

[00:45:47] B slammed there was only one way to do it which was Mega dose of statins I don't believe any patient needs to be on a mega dose of a Statin today because um we just have too many other tools and I do have some concern about Mega dose of statins because one the efficacy curves show that statins hit their maximum efficacy at about quarter dose like the the curve for the efficacy of a

[00:46:12] Statin looks like this right so you know for example if you look at reservastatin you're getting 85 of its maximum apob reduction at five milligrams 80 roughly 85 percent of you hit you hit the maximum and by the way it's a drug that is typically dosed up to 40 milligrams so once you hit 10 milligrams there's no need to go any higher because all you're really doing is buying side effects and you're getting very little in the way of increased efficacy so we're very quick to Pivot patients off statins if we can't get great efficacy with no side effects at low dose and on those drugs including statins let's say if you can't get the efficacy at the low dose oftentimes what people who are younger in their 30s 40s even 50s kind of reach out and say do you have any concerns about taking those drugs for such a long period of time well I mean yes and no I think it depends on the alternative right so um again I think that there are some people who kind of poo poo uh the side effects of statins and say they're non-existent well I think that's that's that's that's that's a ridiculous thing to say they're a well-documented side effects of statins at least three that are that shouldn't be ignored right one is muscle aches the two is elevations of transaminases or liver function tests and the third is insulin resistance now all of these are relatively small but they're not zero and two of the three are objectively measurable so like why would we ignore that right so I really like when you have objectively measurable side effects so um I would say that if a young person is in a situation where perhaps they can't afford bentidoic acid next Lizette PCS going down Inhibitors because to be clear those drugs are expensive at this time and statins are not yeah your alternative might be well I'm going to be on a Statin at least go through the trouble of trying to find the right one that produces the fewest side effects um again you know we think that probably patavastatin or livolo reservastatin or Crestor probably the best places to go but it's also so highly individualized that

[00:48:42] I think you just have to try a couple until you find the ones that are doing them doing the best without any collateral damage and you've talked about pcsk9s before but do you think we're any closer to those being more widely available and by widely available just meaning at a potential lower cost to individuals I think so because you know we now have kind of um through a different mechanism you have a shot that can be administered once every six months um so I think that the twice monthly shot that I take for pcsk9 inhibitor which has already come down in price by more than 50 percent since that drug came out eight years ago I think there will just be continued price pressure on these drugs as more and more other drugs become available and speaking of drugs you mentioned before you think for the future of LP in little a that there's a drug in the pipeline that you're pretty optimistic about being available for people who have a high output level a which could be anywhere from 8 to 12 up to 20 percent of people and we've had podcasts on that before and so just with the amount of people that have a high LP level a often they'll reach out because up until now there's not really a drug that can lower that so do you just maybe want to talk a little bit more about what's on the future for LP little a medications yeah truthfully I haven't been following anything for the last few months so I don't have anything new to say on this since I probably last spoke about it but um there is a there is a drug being made by a company I think in San Diego that is an antisense oligonucleotide so the drug disrupts the DNA um the process of of the the DNA making

[00:50:26] RNA to make APO little a so it interrupts the synthesis of the protein that turns an LDL into an LP little a and um the drug worked very well in phase two so in phase two studies which don't have clinical hard outcomes the outcome is just is the biomarker improving there was a a complete obliteration of LP little a and there were no side effects over the short haul so what matters now is the phase three trial which is ongoing and that's testing the the more important question which is does eliminating LP little a via this mechanism reduce clinical events does it reduce major adverse cardiac events so the answer to that question will determine whether or not this drug is approved and therefore becomes available but I will say this it is unlikely for me to imagine that that drug will be approved to treat patients with primary prevention because the manner in which it's being tested understandably is for secondary prevention this is very common in in drug development where you first test the drug the clinical indication is in the highest risk patient so you get the answer relatively quickly so this is a trial that is looking at people who have already had major adverse cardiac events and it's basically seeing can we prevent subsequent events and if the answer is yes I believe the drug gets approved it gets approved for that use case it would still be able to be used by anybody for primary prevention but it's not likely that an insurance company would pay for that yet very interesting and so what's what's a traditional timeline for drug development to go from that first use case which is the most urgent to kind of that primary prevention is that usually years over a decade

[00:52:25] I mean to be I mean the the rule of thumb is one decade and one billion dollars for a drug to go from IND to FDA approval and again once a drug is approved by the FDA anything can be done with it it can be used off label in the case of statins they were very quickly employed for primary prevention probably even before primary prevention trials were published because the drugs weren't that expensive the only reason I think this is an issue here is I do not expect this drug to be cheap got it anything else you want to say on the drug supplement category before we move on only that I can't believe we wasted how many ever minutes we wasted talking about that as a reward you get to talk about nutrition so we go from one positive to another and the first question is what set of words trigger you more when you are asked which diet is best or what is good cholesterol and bad cholesterol [Laughter]

[00:53:29] I don't know those are those are those are those are pretty upsetting questions let's start with the second do you maybe just considering we just hit as CBD uh you made a YouTube video about this but I do think it's an important subject because not only is there a misunderstanding of this with patients but also the amount of doctors out there who I think still use good bad cholesterol do you just want to give a rundown why there is no such thing as good and bad cholesterol yeah so the the term originates from the differentiation between low density lipoprotein LDL and high density lipoprone HDL so um let's start with where there's a grain of Truth here so LDL or low density lipoprotein which is not cholesterol LDL is the carrier molecule it's the low density lipoprotein it's the boat or the submarine that carries cholesterol ldls are bad and hdl's high density lipoproteins are good but HDL and LDL are not laboratory measurements there's such thing as an

[00:54:38] LDL or an HDL that you can check at a lab you can measure the content of cholesterol within the LDL that's called ldlc and similarly you can measure the content of cholesterol within the HDL that's called hdlc so when you have a basic lipid panel and it says your HDL is 50. well if you read the fine print what it's actually saying is your HDL cholesterol concentration is 50 milligrams per deciliter so don't say that your LDL is 120 say that your LDL cholesterol is 120 milligrams per deciliter it's very important I think to be accurate in our nomenclature so the reason that saying there's good cholesterol and bad cholesterol is nonsensical is because cholesterol is cholesterol is cholesterol the same molecule of cholesterol inside the HDL is present inside the LDL what's bad about the LDL is that the LDL traffics that cholesterol into the artery wall where it will get retained and oxidized and lead to the process of atherosclerosis whereas the HDL will not do that that's the fundamental difference so we should really never say good cholesterol and bad cholesterol because it's it's highly inaccurate and it only reflects a lack of understanding of what one is talking about which is why it's um it certainly would be a red flag if a doctor ever said that and then moving to the nutrition side do you maybe want to take a minute to talk about why nutrition research is so flawed and so hard to do and then how because that's true that kind of affects everything you look at within nutritional epidemiology and trying to understand kind of that question of which diet is quote unquote best well I mean gosh that's we could spend an hour on that question um which I don't have the appetite for I think it comes down to the complexity of the organism at question which is us and the complexity of the Intervention which is eating so it's really the worst of

[00:56:45] Both Worlds right it's it's we can study something as complicated as nutrition in a simple organism that can be put in a cage where you can control everything and where lifespan is short enough that you can actually measure how inputs affect outputs on a reasonable time scale but to be clear even studying the effects of nutrition in a confined environment using more complicated organisms such as rhesus monkeys as was the case in the Nia Wisconsin experiments from the 1980s which which again began in the uh in the uh in the late 80s I believe um that's an experiment that could never be replicated right I mean it took you know north of 20 years to do an experiment in rhesus monkeys where you could still have perfect control over what they ate and it's not entirely clear what the answer was that was an experiment that sought to test the question does caloric restriction extend life and the answer turned out to be it depend if you it depends if your monkey lives in Wisconsin or Bethesda Maryland uh of course I'm being tongue-in-cheek I think that study did answer the question if you knew how to read the study I won't get into that because I think I have a whole chapter devoted to that in the book um so that's that's basically the long and short of why it's so difficult to study so when you study it in humans you can do controlled experiments in a research setting but by definition they can't tell you anything about health in the long term sense because it would be almost impossible to confine humans for more than a month or so and control everything they ate so one can do those types of experiments to understand very precise mechanisms of action but those rarely translate to a clear understanding of Health if you want to understand what happens over the course of a year three years five years ten years by definition you have to do that outside of a hospital and you have to do it with patients being able to eat what they want there are some historical exceptions to this rule so for example the Minnesota coronary study was a seven year study that was uh well I shouldn't say that it was I think the actual intervention was probably closer to three or four years I could be wrong on that um but it was done on patients in a nursing home and you know there you had the interesting situation where you had patients who were relatively old therefore at high risk for ascvd but the investigators had complete control over what those patients ate because every meal was being provided to them um that experiment was rather interesting and that it did not yield what the hypothesis suggested um and again I think there's lots that could be learned from that potentially but net net this is why nutrition in humans tends to rely heavily on epidemiology where you are looking for patterns without doing an experiment without randomization and so with your patience then are you still continuing to try and manage their nutrition manage their diet not to you put everyone on the same diet but more so what is that patient doing and how do you get the best metabolic health for that patient yeah I mean we think that the most important parameter for determining metabolic health is energy balance so you know even the quote unquote best diet if it's in excess of energy balance will produce poor metabolic health so regardless of what you think the best diet is if you think it's a keto diet or a paleo diet or a low carb diet or a

[01:00:20] Mediterranean diet or a vegan diet take any version of those and consume them to excess to the point where you are no longer in energy balance and you are accumulating adipose tissue that leaks out of the subcutaneous space and you know gets into the liver gets into the viscera you're going to be unhealthy so again I you know I always think people are majoring in the minor and minoring in the major on nutrition and when they start to fight in dietary tribes on this stuff and we kind of there are some general principles like I do still think that clinically in my experience patience with profound insulin resistance tend to respond better to carbohydrate restriction as the best tool to reduce total intake you have to create a caloric deficit in those patients and in my experience they respond better to carbohydrate restriction than they do Straight caloric restriction or fat restriction um ultimately it matters most that you can find something that is manageable and sustainable over the Long Haul none of this matters if you can you know adhere to the perfect diet for three months and then you can't it's better to have a 7 out of 10 diet in terms of quality and Perfection that you can sustain indefinitely then a 10 out of 10 diet that you can only sustain for three or six months and some other questions we see come through are questions where people are kind of confused on why should we not just look to populations with longer lifespan and attribute their longevity to their diet so there's you know different populations around the world who will traditionally live longer and so do you associate their longevity with their diet is that a mistake for people to do it's a complicated question because um there are probably too many factors that factor into why these populations live a long time um so if you look at for example the

[01:02:21] Okinawa where everybody loves to talk about the Okinawa in Japan unquestionably a very long-lived people although I've read recently not as long lived right so as the current generation of Okinawan adopt a more Western lifestyle inclusive of diet by the way a lot of those things seem to go away so it suggests that it might not just be the diet that is responsible for the the the benefits that these that these cultures um are are bestowed with so what are some of the other things that could factor into that well we could certainly look at activity level exercise level sleep stress social connections um lack of other toxic uh elements in the environment um

[01:03:13] I think the same exercise is true when you look across all of these populations the other reason that I think it's very difficult to say there's any one perfect diet is when you look at these different uh populations and Pockets over the past 100 years that have popped up and have been studied who seem to outlive others even in relative proximity to them um their diets are actually quite diverse so what does that tell us right so if you have you know people in Japan and people in Switzerland and people in this part of Africa and people in this part of the Arctic or whatever where you see reasonable pockets of longevity but their diets are relatively diverse it might be interesting to look at what's missing from all of the diets or what do they have in common in their absence or what do they have in common in their presence but to me at least it suggests that there's probably a pretty robust nature within the human to manage a variety of different dietary conditions again it comes down to provided energy balances met and I think provided that a person stays metabolically healthy so they're active they're sleeping well cortisol levels are not through the roof all of this is to say I I think our diets are problematic in this country but

[01:04:42] I don't think that changing the way people eat alone will turn us into you know quote-unquote a Blue Zone and you hinted at this earlier question we get asked a lot which is are you still doing your longer fast and if not kind of why is that I'm not and I mean I think there are several reasons I'm not but truthfully um perhaps one of the most uh logistically relevant ones is just I don't travel anymore and

[01:05:16] I used to only do my long fasts when I was traveling when I was away from home and it was just so much easier to be fasting when I was in New York than uh being at the time in San Diego but now I never travel so it would mean that if I wanted to do long fast I'd be doing them at home and um you know I just don't I just don't feel like doing it and I don't have a better answer than that

[01:05:44] I think it also speaks to the fact that I don't have a clear sense of what the benefit is I think I'm you know this is one of those things where I'm going to reserve the right to completely change my mind right if there's some if there's if I if I had some biomarker that could convince me that a seven day fast even once a year had a meaningful rewrite on some negative processes in my body I mean I would I would happily make that sacrifice again but in the absence of knowing that I I just

[01:06:13] I don't you know the cost is a bit high right now and another thing on the nutrition side that you talk about a lot is the importance of protein and we kind of just did a premium email that kind of looked at the pros and cons of protein because when you look at protein and aging it does seem like it's a bit controversial in sense of what people will recommend and so the question that came through and comes through often is if someone's under 50. so let's say you're 30 or 40 do you think it's important that they err on the side of caution and eat less protein based on the research or do you still think no matter what age you are protein is so important and that everyone should be getting as much as possible of it I think it depends on how much muscle mass that person has so if you have an individual who's overnourished and adequately muscled right so they're overweight but they actually have a sufficient amount of muscle mass and they need to go into a caloric deficit we would certainly tolerate also a little bit of a protein deficit in that individual not because I think it's necessary but because I think it's easier to hit caloric targets if you are able to relax your protein

[01:07:33] Targets in other words if you say you need to be in a caloric deficit and hold one gram of protein per pound of body weight that becomes really challenging if you say look you could be at 0.6 to 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight per per pound of body weight and critical or deficit is much easier conversely if a person is overnourished and under muscled I think we do have to toe that fine line of keeping protein

[01:07:58] High because that person needs to be putting on muscle as they're losing fat and the truth of it is I don't find the data for people below 50 having an increase in mortality with high protein being at all convincing I think that I think that is easily attributed to caloric excess as opposed to protein excess and I think that there are enough other confounders there that it's really a proxy for poor health than it is a proxy for high protein furthermore the absolute mortality in people below 50 is so low in terms of absolute amounts that even a slight increase in the relative amount is trivial finally it's very important when people are still able to put on muscle that they put on as much as possible because once you're in the over 50 category you're kind of clawing on for dear life and trying to keep as much of that muscle as possible so I don't really want people entering middle age with a muscle deficit this kind of goes back to our original question like even if someone comes up with the solution for cancer and Alzheimer's disease and all of these other things you still have to Ward against Frailty you still have to make sure that you enter that marginal decade physically robust and most people don't come close to it they're really really under muscled late in life and another question we get asked a lot is how do you eat so much protein in a day as we're kind of going through Peter protocols why don't you just run us through your protein per day and what that looks like again I have the luxury of being at home so it's um you know I have more control over what I eat than if I was you know back on the road but

[01:09:39] I get a lot of it through venison um so you know Maui Nui again disclosure I'm an investor in that company um they make a really really good venison jerky stick and I love it because it has no garbage in it it's literally just got some natural flavors in it I absolutely love the taste of it so that makes life easy and each stick I eat the peppered ones has like 9.9 grams of protein in it it's funny the USDA makes you or I don't know if it's the USDA or whichever governing body determines food labeling you have to round down so it says nine grams of protein on the stick but it's actually 9.9 grams is what it measures so I actually think of each stick as having 10 grams of protein so I will easily throw down five to ten of those sticks a day and that would represent one versus two high protein snacks um and then the rest of it I'm kind of getting in you know uh you know my food basically um lately I haven't really been doing much on the protein shake front because

[01:10:47] I'm getting more from the the bars sorry the jerky sticks are just quicker and easier for me to than making a shake but but I would also you know use a high quality whey protein shake if necessary um so it's it's not that hard for me to kind of hit my hit my goals throughout the course of a day and by the way what am I targeting you know I'm sort of targeting you know somewhere between 150 and 180 grams of protein per day and how often is that spread out between typically like four hits yeah I've been in plenty of meetings with you where you'll walk in with just a handful of jerky sticks drop them on the table you'll be like anyone else want one and then within 15 minutes they're all gone and all the wrappers are right in front of you so I can attest that I've seen you do that protocol for sure anything else on the nutrition front you want to talk about before we move on no all right next section wearables so what is your current favorite wearable or just a device that tracks things for you so maybe it doesn't have to be something that is like on your body at all times but just what's your favorite device for tracking and it can be tracking anything you know I I've been using something called Morpheus lately which is uh it's got two heart rate monitors it's got a chest strap and a wrist strap not a wrist a forearm strap and um it's got an app that in the morning you lay down and put the heart rate monitor on and do you answer four questions how long did you sleep last night so I checked my eight sleep for how long I slept and then how well did you sleep so I look at my eight sleep score and get a sense of with the quality of my sleep and then I enter that and then um how do I feel and how sore am I so I would ask these these um four questions and then I do a two minute lay down with the heart rate monitor on and it measures my heart rate and my respiratory rate and my heart rate variability and then it spits out a readiness score and it provides training zones via heart rate for the day so over the past six months I've been doing an experiment where every time I do a zone two workout I'm using the heart rate that it predicts

[01:13:16] I'm riding to my rpe and then I compare the lactate at the end of that ride to the predicted heart rate from Morpheus to the rpe heart rate and I will say that it tracks pretty darn well better than I would have expected and the reason I'm doing this is to see if this could be a good tool for our patients to use who might not be as clued in to their own rpe and who clearly don't want to check their lactate levels and are you using Morpheus for anything do you use any of that data for anything outside of zone two are you using it for how hard you'll push that day lifting anything like that I don't um I know that uh certainly that's how they would you know suggest you use it that you I don't wear it I don't wear it outside of my zone 2 or VO2 max training so I don't wear it when I'm in the weight room I don't wear it rucking um yeah in large part because I hate wearing heart rate monitors in general if I don't find them comfortable I can sort of tolerate it when I'm on a bike but I don't want to be wrecking with one

[01:14:21] I don't want to be lifting with one so um yeah I I don't but it's probably the case that it would be an even better predictor of my training uh if it could see me across the day if it could see me train in every workout it would probably be an even more effective tool because it would understand like you know where I am in terms of overload so another wearable we get asked a lot and you've talked a lot about this and I believe you still use it with a lot of patience is cgms and so is that something you're still using a lot with your patients we do yeah we use CGM a lot it's a great tool for you know when we have questions it provides answers you know when we we could sit here and look at a person's ogtt and you know in some cases it's just a slam dunk like this person is is super metabolically dialed in in other cases it's a complete slam dunk this person has Type 2 diabetes um you know by ogtt criteria even if not by A1C criteria but there are a lot of people in the middle and this is a great way that we can glean more information and really kind of dial in our treatment for them and so there was some controversy way back when on if cgms were still valuable still useful for people who are non-diabetics have you changed your opinion on that at all not one bit and do you maybe just kind of want to walk through people you kind of hinted at there but what you look for with cgms and ultimately what people if someone's wearing one because it seems like it is more widely available for non-diabetics now and so you see a lot more of them around so if someone gets one what are some of the things you like to see within patients what are some of the things you look at kind of how do you use it

[01:16:21] I mean we still look for the same things I think average blood glucose is still the most important metric we care about um because that's the one for which we have the most data in other words we know all cause mortality data as as it relates to hemoglobin A1c hemoglobin A1c is a measurement that's used to impute average blood glucose so this is a very very close proxy when we can see average blood glucose on CGM even though it's not the same as measuring A1C it's very difficult to argue that knowing your average blood glucose on

[01:16:54] CGM and knowing your A1C aren't highly comparable and therefore by proxy the lower your average blood glucose on CGM the lower your all-cause mortality because it is abundantly clear that the lower your hemoglobin A1c even outside of the diabetic range the lower your all-cause mortality so first and foremost that's the metric we care about the other metrics we look at of course are what's the standard deviation so you know all things equal do you have less variability in your glucose then more and and then finally and the least important I think is you know just what are the what's the you know how how big are the spikes you're seeing now in truth that becomes less important if the first two are reasonable if a person's average blood glucose is 98 milligrams per deciliter with a standard deviation of 16 milligrams per deciliter it doesn't really matter what kind of spikes they have because they're they're clearly not going to be too many um you know unless they're you know using insulin right like you could obviously arrive at those numbers the wrong way um so I would say that fixating on average blood glucose and standard deviation are probably the most important thing from when you would wear one do you recall what caused the biggest Spike you ever saw

[01:18:10] A A buddy of mine took me to this vegan restaurant in New York once I think it was called like Candle 79 or something uh is really close to my apartment um and it was great it was amazing food but obviously by definition like it's just basically all carbs and I remember the dessert was so incredible and I remember looking at my CGM after it was like 180 and I feel like that's about the highest I'd ever seen do you think we're any closer to continuous blood pressure monitors so absolutely you do and how how far out do you think that is because I know in the past with Ethan Weiss the Amman blood pressure you've talked about how important that is as a device and you wish I think we have it right so I think the actia device Works um at least it works as well as an automated cuff Works um so this is a device uh that is not yet FDA approved but it is approved by this similar governing bodies in Europe so this is a device that's already on the market in Europe and it's a it's a bracelet that you wear that optically measures a signal in your wrist and you calibrate it against a manual a pardon me against an automated cuff and um every two hours it gives you kind of your average blood blood pressure so over the course of a day you'll get 12 blood pressure readings and um

[01:19:46] I would say even though automated Cuffs in general are nearly as good as manual cuffs for an automated cuff I don't see any difference really between this and pick your favorite automated cuff so I think this device is I mean I I really hope that this device gets approved in the US because we'll certainly have every one of our patients wearing this and it would do away with ambulatory blood pressure cuffs which are cumbersome and difficult to use and low compliance and artificial interesting so so any listener viewer in Europe would have access to this that's right and then what do you think the rough time frame for people in the US is it years a decade how does that process typically work it's entirely dependent on the

[01:20:39] FDA it's possible it doesn't get approved at all if the FDA is um difficult to work with on this unfortunately I hope that's not the case so if anyone listening watching works for the FDA something to internally push on then yep um any other wearables that you're excited about whether they're close to being here or even in the long term like 10 plus years I mean I I would I would always welcome continuous lactate monitoring during exercise I think that would be um that would really really make you know zone two training enjoyable for me just as opposed to having to do the finger Pricks all the time or just yeah and just just it's just it to me it's the most accurate way to really understand what's happening I mean even heart rate and rpe are just approximations for what you're really interested in right um so so I think yeah just being able to monitor lactate levels while you're exercising especially during doing cardio training I'd also love to be able to do my VO2 max workouts with a lactate meter continuous lactate meter so I could actually watch lactate rise and clearance on each subsequent set you know as I'm fatiguing you know am I am I really just breaking down metabolically as much as anything else you know so Peter I think that was the majority of the questions we wanted to get through as we kind of said at the outset those are kind of questions that come through often um so we kind of compiled them here but any closing words you want to tell people no um I think what what episode number are we at roughly well at the time of this recording 267 so this will be in the two seventies okay so creeping up on 300 but also at the time of this recording hit five years as of last month which is kind of crazy because uh you know that's what was fun to have

[01:22:47] David sabatini and Matt cable and back on is because they were not only the first 10 episodes but if I remember correctly I think that was you and Bob interviewing them and recording it for the book that we then turned into a podcast which won shows that we didn't even think about the podcast that time and two it shows how freaking long you wrote that book for that's right I remember those interviews I went up to Boston with Bob in the summer of 2017 to interview David and then uh Matt came to New York and I interviewed him a month later and that's like a year before the podcast came out so yes that was literally just done for the book pretty funny yeah it's kind of crazy to see how far things came along not only with the podcast but also now seeing the book out and the reception from that which is great because We've joked about it before but

[01:23:44] I think we can both seriously say there was a lot of periods of time where we didn't think that book was ever going to get released yeah right up until a couple a couple months before yeah yeah all the way up until 2023 so awesome well hopefully people enjoyed this kind of a little different of a style but until next time Peter have a good one you too Nick thanks man [Music]
