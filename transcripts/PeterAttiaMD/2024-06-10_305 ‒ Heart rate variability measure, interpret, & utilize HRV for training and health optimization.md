Joel Jamieson is a conditioning expert who developed Morpheus to give people a smarter way to build their conditioning regimen and improve their recovery. In this episode, Joel dives deep into the world of heart rate variability (HRV), explaining its scientific foundation, how it measures the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the various methods of measurement, and how it can guide healthier lifestyle choices and improved training performance. He explores the nuances of HRV calculation, the impact of aging on HRV, and the roles of genetics, exercise, and other lifestyle factors in this process. He also covers Morpheus, the innovative training tool that won Peter over after his initial skepticism, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness in guiding training and optimizing fitness outcomes.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I I think what it comes down to is each person has a certain amount of training in a week they're I like I think it's a weekly basis right because that's kind of the cycle we live in there's an amount and a type and an intensity of training that you are individually going to respond the best to and if you go above it not the great things are going to happen if you go below it you're you're not going to get the output that you want and that amount is not easy to find and it changes on a weekly basis it's not the same week in week out and so the more that you can hone in on that core how much do I need and how much intensity do I need if you can get that right week in and week out you will see continual improvements and that work will turn into result if you don't answer that correctly bad things happen you either waste your time because you're not getting as much out of as you could or you do end up overtrained in which case we see injuries and we see burnout and lots of things that are going to have negative Health consequences so I think ultimately what you said is I want to use information to make sure that I'm getting the most Bang from my buck the best result for the amount of work I'm putting in and that's where I think data can play a really powerful role is it's information that you can use to make much more granular decisions around rather than just guessing oh I should go do 40 minutes today should you or I should do 200 minutes this week is there anything to support that other than just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks and I think that's what intrigued me so much about HRV is it felt like I could open the black box and get some real answers other than like test train for eight weeks remeasure see what happened

[00:01:29] I don't want to wait wait 8 weeks I don't want to potentially lose the gains I could have made across that time period so for someone like yourself that's again wanting to get as much out of their time as they possibly can yeah data can play a really strong role in that because it can answer questions that can't be answered otherwise hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:52] AA hey Joel thanks for coming out to uh to Austin um and uh you know been uh looking forward to this discussion for some time we've not met before but had uh what seems like an endless stream of email communication so I always appreciate your uh your willingness to not just respond to all my questions but the thoroughness with which you do so um this is a topic that as we were discussing just a few minutes ago I think uh everybody has heard of it people have a vague sense of what it is but once you get Beyond a very superficial description of it most people um I think don't really understand it and certainly most people don't understand how to use the data and

[00:02:35] I would absolutely include myself in that category so the topic of course um of of heart rate variability is near and dear to your heart um maybe before we dive into the weeds of this stuff maybe just give folks a bit of a sense of your background and and kind of what brought you to to the study of this and and you know over what period of time yeah I mean look it's it's really inter to me to see the growth of it because I've been using it now for 20 years and the story of it it's really fascinating to me because I was in my early 20s and I had just graduated from University

[00:03:09] Washington um i' had interned there and done some strength conditioning and then was progressing to the Seahawks to work with the same coaches and there was a track coach named Randy Huntington and most people probably never heard of Randy but he was the USA Track and Field jumps coach he coached Mike Powell who broke Carlos's long jump 1993 something like that Ry Randy was around for a long time he was tremendous coach and he was from my area and I just kind of was talking to him one day and I asked him some general advice you know as a young coach what would you suggest and you know resources and all sorts of stuff and he writes a phone number down for me and says you need to call this guy and I was kind of like okay you know whatever you say Randy and so I call this guy and this this thick Russian accent answers the phone and says his name is Val and I still don't really know what I'm calling this guy for I just know that Randy told me to and so he says I'll be in your area I'll meet you at the airport and I still I'm like okay right like I I'm just kind of playing along and I'm not really sure what the the whole point of this is but Randy says call this guy so

[00:04:08] I call this guy and he just says I I will show you the technology and I'm again kind of like okay uh and so I go down the CAC airport and I see this kind of big Russian looking guy with a trench coat I mean looks like he could be straight out of a movie and he like introduced himself and he's like lay down on the couch and so I hope you're now out of the airport or no in that while I'm in the hotel by the airport actually yeah so you know and and so again I'm kind of

[00:04:34] I'm just in the dark of what is going on and he says lay down on the couch and so I laid down on the couch and he's like take your shirt off and I'm I'm at this point I'm looking around like is there some kind of practical joke like is is Randy just messed with this is when you have a lot of faith in Randy this is when I have a lot of faith in Randy and paid off um and so he does this big briefcase and he pulls out this big laptop and he starts plugging in wires and all the sort of stuff and he pulls out these electrodes he starts putting them on my CH and he does basically an

[00:05:01] ECG and he's asking me birth date and weight and all this sort of stuff and he's like don't move and so I sit there for two and a half three minutes and I see all this stuff on the computer happening and I'm again still just completely in the dark right what what what is this guy doing to me like I have no idea um and after about 3 minutes he's like finished you know sit up and he starts kind of tell me about my recovery status and my Readiness my metabolic profile my central nervous system starts telling about all this stuff that didn't really make a whole lot of sense of how he would know he was he was like you know you're much more strength oriented and your cardiovascular system is not very good which is accurate at the time maybe didn't take a computer to see that because I was definitely on the strength side but he started just telling me the story of HRV and heart rate and variability and this was again 20 plus years ago it was not something that people were aware of and I had never of course heard of it and the idea that you could take something out of a laptop connected to my body and have any idea of physiologically what I was as an athlete or as a human being was completely new and seemed foreign to me and I immediately was like I need this because it seemed to me like there's so much of a black box when it comes to

[00:06:08] Fitness right like sometimes I do a workout and I get better sometimes I do workouts and I don't why like what is what is the right magic answer here to always get the workouts that I want to see are the results and so he started talking about the story of heart rate variability and this is really fasting because you don't read this when you look at the Western literature so you know as you you probably know it goes back way 1700s they were aware of bat2 be intervals Chinese have used pulse medicine a long time but the Russians were pretty ahead of the game as far as application of HRV so in the 19 late 1950s they were aware that from an ECG you could pull out these btb intervals and get something more than just heart rate and so when they send the first human being in space Yuri Garin they were able to send back the ECG and some respiratory data and see fundamentally what happened to people when you shot them into space which they really didn't have a way of gauging without this and so they saw as soon as he went into space his HRV went way up probably because you have changes in blood pressure you'd have less gravity so you don't have to have as much muscle activity and they started using this literally all the way back in the 1960s which is pretty fascinating because you didn't really see that in the western literature for decades later really in a meaningful way then in the 1980s they were dominant as far as all

[00:07:27] Olympic sports right they just crushed us now they had a very elaborate drug program they had very elaborate train program they had you know a lot of different things that gave them the advantage but in the mid 1980s they started basically figuring out can we use this tech for sport performance and so they put together an engineering team um and they started collecting data on thousands of Russian athletes of all levels from their school age kids all the way up to the Olympic athletes and they collected just populational norms and they started building the system that was meant to monitor training and you know be used for this purpose and they you know don't get me wrong they had really high volumes but they did blood monitoring like weekly or monthly they were constantly testing they you know from an organizational standpoint their communist structure gave them a very hierarchal way to organize this sort of stuff and monitor it so anyway they spent years working on this platform and then before they could finish it the Soviet Union collapsed and kind of the whole team that was involved in this just dispersed and left left

[00:08:26] Russia and just by chance a lot of them had been involved in track and field different sports they end up reconvening in a track meetting Eugene and kind of just talking about this path project and they decide that they want to get together and keep working on this because they never brought to fruition and they did and that was ultimately the first system that I think was available

[00:08:44] I mean it was the first system that was available commercially with with the intent of being used for Sport and Fitness and that was what I was being introduced to at the time um and this was the result of this project being finished uh the problem is they wanted $35,000 for it and it was you know it was a very research heavy medical type system that was not easy to interpret and I didn't have $35,000 um but I convinced them to let me help them introduce it to teams across the US and gain some exposure for them and we worked at a deal and I started using it but it gave you 12 or 14 different metrics of heart rate variability it required you like I said connect electrodes to people before you'd measure them and really it was that introduction to it where I started this whole journey and you know 20 years of looking at data and coaching people and trying to understand what the data was telling me and how it aligned with all other metrics is really just led me down this path of of how you get tar rate very today and it's you know it's certainly been a large change but it's kind of that that crazy journey of starting one day in a laptop and a you know in a hotel next to the airport and now it's on everyone's phones and watches and everything else but I've been like I said 20 years coaching with it and that's really the the difference is I was a coach I open a gym I worked with lots of Fighters athletes and different teams and Military groups using data looking at HRV you know the whole the whole nine yards so it's uh it's been a long time but it's it's really fascinating to see it grow so let's talk a little bit about the the actual measurement um so in in the example you gave when you were first introduced to it it was done off in

[00:10:20] EKG um I I assume three leads would be sufficient it was six back then okay but you can certainly get it from three obviously yeah so would would we say Joel that that's still the gold standard for how to measure HRV yeah absolutely I mean if you're talking about medical grade research quality you want the cleanest signals you want the most signals ECG three lead six lead is is by far the way to go this might be a little too in the weeds but given how technical this topic is do you want to explain how an EKG works because I think it will be relevant to distinguish between what an

[00:10:55] EKG is doing what a chest strap is doing what Optical sensor is doing on the forearm on the wrist or on the finger these are all going to be basically the tools the technology companies are using to measure HRV but as you and I have discussed and you know gone deep on this uh there's a total difference in the

[00:11:15] Fidelity of the signal depending on where the signal is acquired yeah exactly and and given that our audience here is uh an appreciative audience for nuance I I think it might be worth explaining from the gold standard all the way down how these signals are required what's happening physiologically and electrochemically that's enabling the capture of the signal sure I mean you can kind of group these into two things right one is the electrical signal of the heart itself right and that's what we're measuring with an ECG or EKG or the chest strap you're literally measuring the polarization repolarization of the heart as the chambers are beating and you get this electrial signal that gives you the

[00:11:51] QRS complex right and we're honing in on where those B2 be intervals are because ultimate to get HRV we need the exact amount of time from one heartbeat to the next because that's what we're quantifying so if you have electral signal you get a very clear clean signal that you can pull out those exact beatto beat intervals and that's where we fundamentally get heart rate variability from if we're talking is it I mean is it always done R to R because that's the cleanest signal yeah it's always done R to R so you just have to be able to identify where is the peak of the r interval right the more accurately you can identify here's the peak of the r wve here's the peak of the r wve the more accurately me correctly because it's been so long right so the p is the polarization of the

[00:12:34] Atria uh and then the QRS is the ventricular is it the repolarization or the contraction believe it's the contraction yeah and then the t-wave is the repolarization exactly so you're basically the r-wave is giving you if my memory serves me correctly I'm sure there's a cardiologist listening who's going to scream right now but that's the peak electrical signal of the contraction of

[00:12:55] The ventricle exactly yeah I'm not cardiologist either but from my my memory that's correct as well um but yeah you're getting this exact electrical signal that's showing us where that Peak is happening and because it's at high resolution and it's electrical we can pick that out pretty easily especially the more lead you have the more you're going to be able to get that the difference between that and an optical sensor and and tell me that by the way if I'm wearing um a polar chest strap which is what I wear when I'm on my bike I I have a chest strap uh is how is the Fidelity of that compared to an EKG it's pretty close honestly it's it's very close as far as picking out the actual peak of the r-wave it's going to be within a millisecond which is which is more than enough now obviously if you have a full sixl EKG you're going to get even more um but you don't need it for HRV as long as you can identify that peak of the r wve precisely within one or two milliseconds of what it's actually at and that's where the gold standard is is from the ECG and just to give folks a sense of that a millisecond a thousandth of a second is what is the unit that HRV is typically being measured in so person is looking at their HRV and they're seeing a number that says 60 milliseconds you're saying with a chest strap you would put a plus or minus of one or two milliseconds on any reading that comes outly as long as it's a good chest strap now the cavat is good skin contact and those sorts of things if it's moving around or it's not in the right place you can lose some of that which of course you have a better chance of getting the signal correct with actual electrodes right um and so that is really the gold standard and that's how it was done for decades and that's how most you know 90 plus per of the research has been done with either the

[00:14:34] EKG or with chest stps because that's really been the gold standard of How It's measured the use of these PPG or Optical sensors really has only been the last you know five six years they they've been around and traditionally their accuracy was just questionable when it came to it and they don't get the same electrical signal they're measuring changes in blood volume through the skin basically electrod shine electric or shine the LED light down into the skin it reflects differently based on the blood flow flowing through the the arteries below it and so you're getting the pulse and they actually call it pulse rate variability it's not really heart rate variability if we want to get technical it's pulse rate variability but it's showing us the same thing it's showing us that cardiac cycle now there seems to be a big difference between the wrist and the forearm so um on my bike if I'm riding indoors um well actually I'm doubling up so I'm wearing we're going to people are going to be like what is wrong with this

[00:15:33] Peter guy he has so many stupid devices it'll all come to Full Circle through this when I'm on my bike indoors if I'm Outdoors I'm just wearing my polar chest strap because it pairs perfectly with the system with the bike system I'm using Outdoors indoors I ride with my Morpheus chest strap and my Wahoo

[00:15:53] Optical sensor the reason is I'm using two different programs the Wahoo sensor on my forearm which is Optical is pairing with my computer and that program I'm using there in urg mode but the reason I'm using the Morpheus chest strap is I'm using the Morpheus program on my phone so it's not but the reason I bring all that up Joel is to say they're perfectly in sync the chest wrap the gold standard and the optical sensor on my arm never off by more than a beat yep and I can see them in real time concurrently conver verely when I'm rucking when I'm ping around I wear a

[00:16:33] Garmin uh GPS watch that measures heart rate it's a very high-end watch it's about a $700 watch it is categorically a piece of garbage I would call it a random number generator for heart rate it can't come close to estimating my heart rate y there are times I look down and it says I'm at 170 beats per minute when I know I'm below 100 conversely there are times when I'm probably at 160 beats per minute and it says I'm at 110 so it as far as I can tell it serves absolutely no purpose occasionally it's accurate I'm sure but but it's so inaccurate so often that I find it I I would never rely on it I'm using it for

[00:17:16] GPS sure I'm almost annoyed that it's a feature that is there they're both Optical sensors why the difference yeah one is location as you mentioned right to get a good resolution you need good blood flow below the surface and you need a lack of movement the biggest problem with PPG sensors Optical sensors as a whole is they get what are called motion artifacts and any kind of movement starts introducing noise into the signal because again we're not getting electrical signal we're just getting this blood flow going beneath the surface that we're using LEDs to detect right for heart rate when you start moving around you get lots and lots of emotion artifacts and it just becomes much more difficult for Those sensors to detect it accurately particularly in like as cyclical mov movements anything where your arm is moving around at random higher heart rates um darker skin colors lots of things throw off PPG sensors so my darker skin is obviously a disadvantage presumably just in general tattoos you know all of these things so Optical censers in particular struggle with higher intensities higher movements higher heart rates all those sorts of things and it's now my Optical sensor on the bike even though admittedly I'm not really moving my upper body isn't obviously moving is it Superior because it's less movement or is it Superior because it's on much larger it's both rightel yeah so there's a com called bance cell that we use it's done a lot of research on this cuz they produce the sensors and they've looked at any location bicep arm calf I mean all of the the above anywhere where you can have the least amount of like even your wrist you have bone movement right even if you're not really moving your wrist can still be flexing and extending and that in just that wrist movement will cause motion artifacts you get much cleaner blood flow on the forearm you get just much less movement and toward as you're moving so you get just a much better overall signal on the forearm in general than you're going to get from the wrist and they've you know they've looked at accuracies of garments and whoops and or like you don't get very good accurate data at all as you've seen when you're doing exercise and even when you're doing somewhat cyclical exercise you can still get as you've seen completely garbage numbers that make no sense because the centor just can't pick up the the blood flow very accurately and like I said tattoos dark skin makes it far worse so in general you know it's the this desk trap is always going to be the gold standard but if you're going to wear an optical senser the forearm where you can get good blood flow is going to be by far the best place to be able to put it and you can even manipulate where in the forearm you tend to get the best signal the best results yeah I I don't know if I'm doing it correctly Joel I I tend to apply it right beneath the anticubital fossa where I know the artery is running yeah that's what you want and and I'm sort of like assuming that I'm going to get the best signal there and I also put it on pretty snug presum I didn't I mean I was just doing that not thinking about motion artifact but sounds like thatc you you want a good enough skin contact that can read you don't want to smash it in there yeah it's not I'm not using is a katsu band yeah exactly not doing pump you probably have a little too tight um but yeah the more secure it is the more so it's almost like there's really three I know you said there's two buckets you could really say it's anything on the chest amazing gold standard always going to be good as long as anything on the forearm

[00:20:23] I think we've established if you do the forearm right at least heart rate to heart rate is comparable we'll talk about the HRV variability and then anything below the forearm is sort of nonsense it's not great it's definitely not great especially if you're doing if you're lifting weights if you're doing interval training if you're doing anything high intensity you're doing change in Direction it's it's garbage you just get very poor data and you know like you said I wouldn't I wouldn't rely on it it might be accurate sometimes and sometimes it'll be way off the one that seems to be I wouldn't say accurate but the most accurate the less accurate is is the Apple watch and I think what they're doing since they can actually have ECG um I think they're just interpolating a bunch of data so when they see bad data they just kind of replace it with what they think the data actually should be I see so you're saying the Apple watch might be a step ahead of other wrist-based devices based on sampling an algorithm yeah exactly I think they're probably you can detect when the junk data is there you don't have to display it the other ones do but they have enough previous data to know your heart rate didn't go from 110 to 160 in 2 seconds right so I think they'd start build the algorith tolerates that for lack of a better word because I'll see it do that right I'll see it go from 100 to 150 and I'm like yeah get that's not even physiologically possible why yeah why wouldn't you sample that out or ask a second order question yeah great great Point um okay let's now talk about the very confusing subject of how one calculates heart rate variability because let's again reiterate what we're talking about right so if anybody has seen an EKG everybody watching us has you've got your little p

[00:22:04] QR s t and you just line up a strip of those and you imagine you were doing this in the olden days you'd have a set of calipers you'd literally measure across R to R to R to R so let's pretend we have a minute's worth of data Joel and a person's heart rate is they're they're laying down and resting so they're at 60 beats per minute so the up approximate beatto beat interval is 1 second a yeah on average or 1,000 milliseconds um what's happening at the physiologic level that makes it such that there is variation and how is that measured and calculated from the raw data and let's start with the gold standard and assume you have an EKG sure yeah as you mentioned you're starting with this gold standard of okay we can accurately pinpoint where are these r r intervals and so we pull out what are called the RR intervals not you know surprisingly and we'll plot those now from there you do what's called correction basically you have to filter data there for filter ectopic beats which are Beats that don't actually arise in a signal atrial node you fill out if there is any noise in the signal or anything like that and you end up with this clean set of RR intervals and let's so let's say I gave you 60 of them sure and it's again it's a person who's at rest so um on average it's a th000 milliseconds between them but I'm going to give you 60 numbers that vary from 900 to 1100 millisec exactly y so this is where things get interesting because when we talk about HRV we just usually give a number yeah and that number can be different but a better way to think about HRV is just a framework to assess variability because there are multiple ways to calculate that there's one category called time domain where we literally just do some math the most common one is rmssd root means successive successive squar differences where they just do some basic math and they get that number of milliseconds of rmssd there's snn there's pnn50 there's all these different call them time domain where they just are taking that time series doing some math on it and giving you a number that represents the average variability so let's talk about the rmssd because it appears to be the most common common for multiple reasons what we are again measuring is that average variability across that time span and what that represents is the input of the vagus nerve the parasympathetic system and it's input into that sinal atrial node of the heart because fundamentally the autonomic nervous system is is governing that heart rhythm and primarily what happens at rest is as that parasympathetic system via the Vegas nerve and the way that it works is it's inating that sinal atrial node in the heart and it's pulsing in beat with respiratory processes so as we inhale that vegus is inhibited and you get kind of this ation of heart rate now actually I should back up if you were to cut out the autonomic nervous system you'd have roughly an intrinsic heart rate of about 100 beats per minute somewhere in that range everybody basically does so if you just and and just let's be back up even a little further Jo I think there's a lot of you and I would take for granted here um so sort of nervous system 101 we have two nervous systems broadly speaking we have one that's under our control and one that is not so most of what you and

[00:25:26] I are doing that people can watch the movement speaking all of these things that's voluntarily under our control but what most people can't see when they're looking at themselves is how many things are happening without any input and thank God for that system that system happens to be called the autonomic nervous system without it we would forget to breathe and we would die our heart stop so all of these vital functions from respiration to heartbeating to regulating blood pressure to digesting have to happen via a nervous system that we never think about yep that system is further subdivided into the two terms you've already brought up a sympathetic system and a parasympathetic system and you've already alluded to one of the most important nerves in that parasympathetic system called the vagus nerve which is a cranial nerve so originates from a very

[00:26:20] Primal part of the brain Y and we won't necessarily get into all the neurotransmitters involved in these things but what you're basically describing is that the heart is under the influence of both of these exactly an example to gets to your point is after a patient has undergone a heart transplant for as an extreme example that vagus nerve is transected their heart is no longer under that control and therefore it's just going to have you your heart rate variability basically zero and that scenario because it would just beat like a metronome y um okay so didn't mean to interrupt but I think that might be just helpful cont understand what we're talking about which is you're talking about even though that person's heart is beating at 60 beats per minute there's still a very fine interplay between what the sympathetic nervous system is doing and what the parasympathetic nervous system is doing yeah we should probably even back up a little bit more that the whole reason that we need this autonomic nervous system is to keep us physiologically Within These normal ranges that we have to be in to be able to produce energy and stay alive right so if our blood pressure goes too high or too low if our blood glucose gets too high or too low if our body temperature gets all of these things have to be within physiological Norms that we'd call that homeostasis that the internal environment has to be controlled at all times regardless of the external environment right so whatever temperatures we're in whatever we're eating whatever we're doing we have to be able to regulate internally and stay

[00:27:50] Within These physiological Norms that are necessary for survival and that fundamentally is what the autonomic nervous system is doing it's keeping us alive and it's trying to match the internal demands with whatever we're trying to do given the external environment right so like you said people have heard of probably these two branches the sympathetic the figh ORF flight or the parasympathetic which people call rest and digest now that's a good terminology to understand but it makes us only think of the sympathetic it's not nuanced enough it's not nuanced enough it also makes us think the sympathetic isn't doing anything unless we're fighting right and it's not really like that and these things aren't binary they're not switches that turn on or off a better way to think about these is is dials that the brain is constantly manipulating and fundamentally what the autonomic nervous system is doing is twofold one is its sensory a lot of information has to go up to the brain to process what the internal environment status is and then the brain has to make decisions and push motor action down to the different organs to make sure that they're doing what they need to do given the state of the body given its external uh relationship with the world so fundamentally the more important uh the more we can regulate our internal environment and match the demands of our external environment like the healthier we're going to be we're going to be more adaptable we're going to have better overall function we probably would just say it's broadly Better Health and so the interplay between that sympathetic and that parasympathetic and making sure they can do their jobs appropriately is a really big piece of making sure that our bodies are going to stay healthy as we age because I would say fundamentally if we look at aging as a whole we lose adaptability mhm right we lose the ability to respond to workouts as quickly we become more likely to become injured when we get sick it takes longer to get over that and that's just the body's ability to regulate itself decline with age so anyway with that said at rest we should have very little sympathetic activity going on and we can talk about this in terms of waking versus sleeping those are different things yes we have a pretty low level of sympathetic just sitting down or laying down yeah and at rest that parasympathetic dial is going to be higher because because we don't need this additional energy that the sympathetic system can drive so at rest we're primarily measuring that parasympathetic input into the heart and as I mentioned it it turns on and off with our respir respiration it's called respiratory science arhythmia and as we exhale that dial turns up just slightly and as we exhale it turns down just slightly but mostly what's happening is we are inhibiting that Bagel input as we breathe in and we are letting it function correctly or not correctly but disinhibiting it as we breathe out and as we exhale and so you're seeing just this pulsation type effect of that vagus nerve on the heart rate accelerating and then slowing down and then accelerating and then slowing down so you're seeing that input pulsing with our respiratory um cycles and so when we measure HRV regards how we do it we're ultimately trying to understand that tone we call it veal tone that input of that vagus nerve into the heart rhythm and that's what we're trying to then gauge as a functional marker of what our autonomic nervous system specifically the parasympathetic nervous system is doing how is it responding to the world around us how is it responding to what we've done in the last 24 48 Hours what is its resting tone how much input does it actually have and from that we then try to gain all the other insights we we can talk about and then just to close the loop on the measurement thing so the most people are using devices that are probably calculated the HRV on the rmssd algorithm yeah it's a transformation that basically run on the data um and if my memory serves me correctly I mean we could figure it out right root mean square or the standard deviation successive squared successive squar of standard deviation so you're basically going to say average or mean value is uh 100 you know mean value is X standard deviation is this and then you probably do a sum square square root of exactly yeah so you get you get your number now the only one I'd say that's different is

[00:32:02] Apple watch actually they use what's called sdnn which is just the standard deviation of the B2B intervals why they do that uh I'm not sure that's one it's historically been used medically and they'll usually measure it for 24 hours and they'll just kind of look at like do you have any autonomic variation does the paretic system function well at all and it's kind of a gross measure it's not nearly as nuanced because we're not measuring Valle input at a particular time we're just measuring across longer periods of time and maybe that's why they did that it seems to me that that would also introduce a bit of noise because you're combining being at rest with being active yeah exactly and you would I mean I don't know if it's the right word but you'd be penalizing people for being more active because the more you exercise the more sympathetic tones you have during exercise the more you're crushing the variability correct yeah and what's interesting is Apple is just kind of measuring randomly for the most part it just kind of measures when you don't know and you can you can do a manual measurement which we can talk talk about and you can actually check it which is a better way to do it but for whatever reason they've just used this metric that nobody else uses and then they kind of measure it periodically when you don't know what's happening and so the number you're just kind of getting in there if you're not actively measuring it is just kind of like I don't know where it comes from so couple things that I remember from a an AMA that I did on heart rate variability a couple of years ago and we'll link to it here in the show notes so that people can go back if they want a real primer on HRV um the reason we did uh a sort of an Ama that was you know a lot of people had questions about it I frankly I don't think we went into nearly um this level of detail about it we talked much more about the mortality data and things of that nature but that was one of the first things that stood out right two two things I remember more than anything

[00:33:42] Joel the first is um there was a relationship between in the research literature what was measured as HRV we got should talk about what that means and all cause mortality and even disease specific mortality and the second thing that really stands out is a graph that I'll never forget that shows on the x-axis age on the Y AIS HRV and what the curve looked like and I couldn't believe how steeply it declined right so the the you know the you and I think what it was plotting if I'm not mistaken was kind of mean or median HRV with uh you knowand with a band of you know you know plus you know call it the in 80% or interquartile range or something like that but it was an unmistakable Trend right which is like a 50-year old's HRV is less than half of a 15year old's um and it just keeps getting further and further crushed as we go down I suppose that speaks to what you said earlier right which is one of the Hallmarks of

[00:34:42] Aging is this sort of lack of resilience and we see it on every level but this is just uh a very notable example which is even at the level of the autonomic nervous system we lose the ability to to recover from insult and life is an insult everything in life is an insult the world around is just insulting us all time it's just we can respond much better to it as we're younger yeah do you have a sense by the way of what it is physiologically at the cellular level that is resulting in this profound reduction in HRV as we age you know what interesting they've they've looked at this and I don't know that we have a great answer for the exact physcal mechanisms we know it's tied to mitochondrial density mitochondrial function we know it's tied to elements of the immune system we know it's tied to hormonal status we obviously see decreases and all those things as we age so there's probably you have to wonder which ones are causal and which ones are the resp I don't think we I don't think we know that but we definitely know that we can increase our AG ofv or we can at least pre prevent the decline most effectively through cardiovascular fitness we see people with higher V2s have higher mitochondrial function they have higher V2 that leads to or at least correlates with greater HRV so we know that cardiovascular fitness in general seems to be the most closely tied to average HRV there's there's also a pretty strong genetic component which we can't ignore um and we can talk about that but yeah if you look at the

[00:36:05] Hallmarks of Aging paper which I'm sure you've seen they kind of take these buckets of things right they say oh as you age you get dispos you get deregulated nutrient sensing you get ccent cells you get stem cell exhaustion you get mitoch they list all these things that happen as we age and they kind of look at this prism of what's the output and if you read that they say okay the output to the major things are loss of resilience to homeostasis and lack of a stress response that's appropriate given the world around us so yeah where that cause and effect and which ones you know causing the other is is tricky to say but I think fundamentally aging is this Progressive loss of adaptability and there's multiple pieces that obviously but we're measuring that as you mentioned is you know one of the things that we want to gauge of HRV is how much of that resilience of that adaptability are we losing as we age and that's something we can influence through lifestyle and training and everything else that we're trying to do here to prevent that slowdown one of the things in that ama that I didn't get a great answer to was how much genetics played a role on this but from our patient population because even though that's a not a huge n it's we've got years and years of seeing these data in patients where every single one of them is using some sort of device and it by the way it's even devices we haven't talked about like if you look at you know really highend things like you know uh uh like mattress covers and things like that like the eight sleep will now measure that quite accurately um so from every form of wearable and and out you you've you've got endless streams of data and there's an unmistakable difference between people I mean there are some people who and let's just talk about this in rmssd we should talk about the other numbers because they you you have to do this

[00:37:53] Apples to Apples but if we just talk rmssd you know I've got PA who live at 100 and a good day for them a good day for them quote unquote they're at 120 and a bad day for them they're at you know 85 but you know if you follow them for 5 years their average HRV is going to be 100 millisecs I've got other patients whose average HRV is 15 milliseconds and a good day for them is 25 to 30 and a bad day for them is 10 um how could that be explained by something other than genes it it isn't I mean there's I've looked at a bunch of

[00:38:31] This research just to understand it's all over the map depending on what paper you're looking at depending on which metrics they calculated they they say genetics is somewhere between like 15 and 70 something per of HRV there's just such a wide range in the research of what you see you know where that exact number Falls I'm not sure but you definitely see a very strong genetic component to it why I don't think we truly understand that but as you mentioned I see people who don't work out at all and they come into the gym or they you know whatever and you look at their numbers you're like you have a very high HRV that you would not expect cuz you clearly don't have a very high level of cardiovascular fitness but I'll say kind of as a whole if you start talking to those people they tend to have a healthier family history they tend to have better health markers I think there's something to that and that that higher H probably still correlates to a health benefit even if it doesn't necessarily come from exercise derived means it's just a genetic thing that they have that probably confer some benefit would you put HRV in a com able bucket to V2 Max in terms of the following uh comp you know amount of it that is genetically determined amount of it that is modifiable and the the the role it might play in understanding overall health status so for v2 Max I know the answers to all those questions right it there is a genetic component it's not huge it's probably closer to that 15% than 70% uh it's highly modifiable but difficult Y and the fact that it's highly modifiable but difficult to modify is why I believe is you know you've probably heard me say this the single greatest predictor we have of mortality um and if there's a better one out there I'd like to hear it but I haven't seen one and I think that's because I always talk about V2 Max as like the integrator of so much hard work yeah it's you can't get there unless yeah you can't you can't cram for the test if if if your V2 Max is in the top 1% you weren't born there you you you

[00:40:31] Blood Sweat and Tears your way to that and all that work does so much good for you y okay so let's use that framework to evaluate HRV you know how genetic is it um how modifiable is it and are the the the modifications you have to put into it then speak to hey if somebody improves their HRV by 50% how confident are we that that moves the needle in terms of what actually matters which is not the silly number but actually the outcome of their life sure no I think it's more genetically based just from what I've seen and probably a bit less modifiable I would say it's less predictive in the sense that if I have somebody who's got an H or you know an

[00:41:11] HRV of you know 110 to use your example or whatever and then I have someone who's got V2 Max I know is I don't know 70 I can pretty well know that person with a V2 Max of 70 is pretty aerobically fit and they've lived a pretty solid lifestyle and had done the the work and the training to to get that level I'm more confident that that person's longevity be benefited and affected from that that I'm confident than somebody who has no workout history that just has a high HRV I don't know that I could say with the same confidence at all just because they have a higher HRV that they would have the same PRN progistic value in all cause mortality so it's it's a it's a metric that we aren't gauging output from right we're just measuring this internal physiological State and I think that confers benefits to someone who has higher HRV but I can't necessarily just look at that number instantly say oh this person's really healthy or this person's really fit necessarily because you do see that much stronger genetic component now if I see a couple if I see some with a higher V2 and I see higher

[00:42:09] HRV chances are you know that's a reflective of all the things we just talked about a healthy lifestyle and a lot of heart training and the physiological changes that come as a result of that and we're more confident that those numbers are going to line up with all cause mortality I think a nice way to interpret that Joel would be the following um as much as people are worrying about their HRV and people really do worry about it you should worry more about your V2 Max because you have more control over it and it's a better predictor of all cause mortality and I do and I think that what gets measured gets managed right and because HRV is so ubiquitous and it's so spit out and basically you're at the point now where if you go get a Starbucks they'll tell you your HRV that they've somehow inferred from the pressure your lips put on the cup I'm being factious um everybody is inundated with these data and is creating a lot of stress yeah I think we want to look at output measures

[00:43:01] V2 Max is the best output measure we can look at something like heart rate and Zone 2 we can look recovery heart rate recovery we can look at actual output measures because at the end of the day I fundamentally think that's what matters we need to as as we age we need to be able to continue to move and we need to be able to continue to be able to respond to our environment around us and output is where we can see those metrics how much what's the metabolic cost for us to move around yeah right as if we can maintain movement as we age can be highly active and if you look at people you know just that you know around you that are healthy and older a lot of them they're very active they move around they have hobbies they have friends they're social they do things they love and that's a big part of keeping them healthy and resilient if we don't have the metabolic capacity to move we've declin a lot faster and so again V2 Max and heart rate at different speeds that correlates the ability to move and maintain that as we age that's far more predictive I think than just an internal metric that you know is important but is does not have the same predictive power and so funny um do you have kids I don't so um anybody who's got kids especially young kids will appreciate this comment but um I've become so much more cognizant of a a a metric I would love to introduce to the world uh that ties into what you're describing called spontaneous movement right so I'm an old guy and even though I'm fit for my age like I don't waste a lot of movement right so I'm already at that stage in my life where does actually think of myself as quite lazy right so I love to exercise and obviously I'm not lazy when

[00:44:31] I'm doing that but like if I'm walking through the airport I'm just walking I will use the stairs and not the escalator and all that stuff I get it all but like if you're with my kids and my two boys are six and nine the amount of spontaneous explosive movement is something I don't remember doing as a kid although I'm sure I did it too but it's really a remarkable thing and we also have a puppy so we have this puppy that also is bouncing off walls but when you see older dogs that's done right like a 14-year-old dog is not even if it's in good health for its age it's not bouncing off the walls whereas that puppy Can't Stop Moving and and the same thing like when I look at my boys like everywhere we go they have to race everything is a race they're they're sprinting there and so if we're walking somewhere they're doing sprints to and from us the whole time and I I just think a There's Something Beautiful about that and but I think it speaks to this idea of Youth right youth is about movement it is converting the chemical energy of our food into the electrical energy that powers muscles and spontaneous Locomotion seems to be this so I don't know at some point like I would love to know like is there a way to take that as another output metric which is GPS on somebody exactly what is the drive to spontaneously move for no apparent good reason we talk about we lose HRV right but we also lose sympathetic drive too we lose some of that ability to turn that sympathetic dial up as we get older too and probably it's as we've lost both of those capabilities the ability to turn that synthetic dial up and crank out more energy and produce adrenaline is that what you think explains the fall in maximum heart rate is it just purely lack of loss of contract the heart loss of contractility the muscular system loss of hormonal release as a result of the sympathetics I mean you're just losing again this adapt ability this ability to turn those two dials as necessary to meet whatever demand you're placing in the body if we can't turn that sympathetic dial as much we don't have that spontaneous energy that you just described to get up and Sprint because that that D is way slower and it probably can't go up as high yeah so it's like we're born with a 0 to 10 riat or dial on both of them and as you age that 10 goes to a 9 8 7 6 five and yeah you can still move them but you just can't move them as much I would call like autonomic range and that really kind of represents what is our body capable of from an energetic standpoint how quickly can we turn that dial up and then conversely how quickly can we turn that dial back down and crank up that parasympathetic side to restore homeostasis and get our bodies back to normal it's it's interesting if you look at um I've looked at the paper where they looked at different uh Navy divers were going through this qualification school which is kind of their equivalent of of uh SEAL training and you know hell week and all that and they tried to pick out what are the variables that separate the people that are really good at this and succeed and make it through versus the ones that don't and they measured

[00:47:40] HRV throughout the process and essentially find what I just talked about is this autonomic range where they could really crank up the sympathetic system when they needed to and then turn it off as soon as the stressor is over and respond in the other direction with a much higher parasympathetic response that ability to use those dials quick quickly and in the right combination seems to be a really key thing to again adaptability and as we said if you age if both those Styles lose their range and they lose their coordination in some respect then we have much less resilience much less adaptability and we should mention too as you pointed out the Vegas and the sympathetics they do influence behavior in a lot of ways there's a there's a whole thing that's be outside my Lane in the psychosocial aspect of this and you can look at the poly Bagel Theory by stepen porges um but fundamentally the brain regulates emotion through anomic function in some capacity and the Vegas is related to social behaviors it's related to cognitive control in in different scenarios it's related to all sorts of stuff they they call it fight flight freeze you know all these things related to how our autonomic nervous system is influencing our emotions and if we don't have that autonomic range we probably have less drive to get up and move around as a result of that as those those nerves and that autonomic system changes what it can can and can't do I mean I I don't think that should ever be underestimated or or understated I think again just even looking at a sample size as small as our patient population I think we see that a lot I think there's a very clear association between an individual that um if you just look at them from a movement and exercise perspective has a very difficult time uh relaxing and uh and relaxing sounds like such a silly word but I mean that in a sort of a clinical sense right like if they can't let their rib cage down if they can't properly generate intraabdominal pressure if they can't go through a sequence of movements that generates some amount of motor control and compensatory relaxation contraction um I think there seems to be very high association between that and emotional stress and psychological stress 100 um and and and and actually pain as well so

[00:49:50] I think we see chronic pain and and again you could argue well where's the chicken where's the egg if you're in pain does that lead to more emotional stress does that lead to an inability to regulate relaxation within the body which further exacerbates pain it's a very vicious cycle it is yeah and you see lack of sleep as we get older older people need just as much sleep but they have a harder time getting as much sleep and sleep is very much tied to that

[00:50:13] Vegas nerve and the parasympathetic nervous system so it's again if we get worse quality sleep we get less adaptability it's it is chicken and egg but fundamentally that's why we want to regulate ourselves correctly and that's where exercise I think the biggest thing exercise does is improves our bi's ability to regulate itself it improves the use of those dials because we are exposing The Bu to aerobic training that we know has some broad correlation to that and we're giving the body a stress it can adapt to in a positive way if we do it in the right amounts and that's the caveat there before we leave the measurement thing I want to go on to another one or two of those measurement um and so at Morpheus what do you guys use to measure so we use rmssd and then we use a log natural transform and a multiplier that sounds like a lot of math but essentially if you look at the data of rssd and you look at like a normal bell curve it's skewed it's non-normal it's all the way to the left so you get these normal ranges of I know 20 to 80 or 100 like you said but then you can get an elite athletes 180 200 and so you this big bunch of data on the far left hand side it's kind of hard to interpret so again I'm not a statistician I didn't create the formula but essentially to normalize this data and make it look more naturally distributed more like a normal bell curve you do this log natural transform use a multiplier and more if it's ends up on a scale that looks more like a 100 point scale so people with lower HRV are be more like the 50 60 people with more moderate 60 70 higher 70 80 you know

[00:51:37] Elite athletes are going to be 90 to 100 it's more of a scale that we have a more familiar relationship with I would say and the the data is more normalized from a uh from a standpoint of a bell curve so it's just an easier to interpret but that's the reason for it so do most people when they start using more and they're also using like whatever other device they're using that's just a purely rmssd device how much discordance are they typically seeing between them really depends on what are they're what they're using right there can be a big difference between the device that they're using the numbers they're getting but the the trends should generally line up if you're seeing

[00:52:16] Morpheus increase as a whole you should see the other one increase as a whole you should see the directional change matching but the actual numbers will be somewhat different depending on where you're at in that Spectrum so let's now talk a little bit about Morpheus I've alluded to it a couple of times so um it's a it's a product I've been using for about a year and a half maybe close to two years um but before I talk about my experience with it and why I use it right like I'm you know everything I do

[00:52:45] I do for a reason I'm a very deliberate human being um so there's a very particular use case that is pretty narrow for how I use it I I I'm I know that I'm not using it to its full potential but it tell folks what this is about your your involvement in this and that's obviously how we got to know each other yeah I mean when I started using the old system I had to wait for people to come in the gym to measure them and so I realized I was getting a pretty small snapshot of what their life story was because I might measure them two three times a week Sometimes they come in the morning sometimes they come in the afternoon and I realized the limitations of that this is back in you know 2007 or 8 and so I wanted to create something that people could use their phones and that we could get way more data from and that was my first system

[00:53:25] Bio Force HRV 2011 and that was really one of the earliest HRV apps out there where we could you know take your phone you could do a recording and you could get your HRV on your own you didn't need uh to come into the gym and one of the limitations of that was all I could look at was your HRV I didn't necessarily have any idea what else was being tied to that and so I could look at the change and ask you a bunch of questions and maybe try to figure out what those changes were coming from but I wanted to create something that also tied in training and sleep and subjective markers and other metrics so that as a coach which I just had a more complete story of what was happening and so that was really the Genesis of of Morpheus and I started that in 2016 2017 so so quite a few years ago and basically what we're doing is we're measuring HRV and then we're tracking activity sleep workouts all that sort of stuff you can use the Morpheus device for a lot of that or you can use other devices so if you're using an Apple

[00:54:18] Watch to track your activity your sleep or Garmin we'll pull that data in but what we're trying to do is take that HRV this is this is something we should definitely talk about there's a lot of apps that give you HRV and then you can either say okay I'm going to interpret what this means myself and I can try to figure out what these changes are it's a physiological metric or you can say the apps are giving me a recovery or a

[00:54:40] Readiness or some gauge that's based on that now this comes back to every app's doing this completely differently right we have a lack of standardization across not just the HRV measurement but then how that information is interpreted to generate recovery or Readiness or some sort of number that the person in the app is saying oh my recovery is 80% or my Readiness is right these are just numbers that we are creating as a way to try to interpret the data and then some of those apps I think do a reasonable job with it some of them don't um but I created Morpheus and this idea of the recovery score based on what I had seen using hrb for 20 years or maybe 15 years to that point it's just a metric of what's appropriate for you on a given day what is your body more likely to benefit from from and so we should probably talk about again what is recovery what is Readiness because those are metrics that Morpheus gives you and

[00:55:33] Ura gives you and whoop gives you and Garmin gives you like a body battery or every kind of app has their own gauge of that but then the question is how accurate is it what does it really mean and I think that's where a lot of confusion also comes in because we're trying to take metrics and turn them into something that's not a physiological measure but something we try to create yeah I mean look I used an aura ring for many years uh probably haven't us used it in a year a year and a half there you know there's better devices I can use to track my sleep now um and the recovery score as you said even if you believe the that the score is accurate and there's no reason to believe it necessarily is um more importantly it's not something you can act on right so let's just say you believe the number and you say okay my recovery score is 80 today and I I certainly believe that if it spits out a 90 versus a 70 you know your whoop or

[00:56:26] Aura there's probably a difference there there's you know you're probably better off on the day you're 90 than the day you're 60 but how do you operationalize that information and so when I was introduced to Morpheus it was actually someone on my clinical team that said you know we're having a hard time giving people real instruction around Zone 2 cuz most people don't want to do what you do Peter no nobody wants to check their lactate levels and go through this and I get it I mean I I I don't i' never fault somebody for not wanting to do a finger stick every time they do a workout um and truthfully for some people just relying on RP can be challenging so this person said hey look um the Morpheus app and we'll talk about how it works you know because I I also appreciate how the measurement is taken the Morpheus app gives you target zones for heart rate every day and if you use the cut off between what it's calling Zone one and zone two that's a pretty good proxy for what your zone two is on that day yep so I bought the system um and started using it and I should show you the data because I have recorded every single workout I have ever done for the last year and a half and I record the following I record the heart rate predicted by Morpheus for what my zone 2 is the heart rate I largely end up at by RP and sometimes they're close usually they're quite close sometimes they're quite far so sometimes Morpheus tells me to be at 138 but I'm kind of gassed out at 131 and sometimes it's the reverse sometimes morphus says you should be at 133 but I feel fantastic and I go to 140 what the power was for the interval and what the lactate is and I I have to tell you Joel

[00:58:27] I I cannot put in words how impressed I am with that system and how remarkably accurate it is at predicting something that is very difficult to predict um so kudos to you for doing that um what I find amazing are the days when and I had one of these days a week ago morphia said I should have been at 140 or 139 for Zone 2 I got on the bike and I did not feel great and I sort of said I think Morpheus got it wrong I'm going to ride to this wattage and my heart rate was about 132 and I checked my lactate and it was 1.1 MMO I was nowhere near my limit of where I could have been that day now again we could get in the Weeds on maybe that's fine maybe that's all I needed that day and maybe I should have just been following how I felt but if

[00:59:19] I'm really trying to get the right training effect I was under trining a little bit on that day um so so I'll kind of pause there because I I I want to kind of let you sort of interpret what I'm saying um and and and you know what you think of like why is it about that CU you spit out three zones Zone one zone two zone three and I think you call them recovery and conditioning yeah it's just terminology right it's just it's just a way to gauge low Moder high intensity more does it surprise you that because I haven't told you this story before in all of our Communications I we've never talked about this particular issue does it surprise you that the heart rate that is on the C between your first and second training zones happens to correspond to this lactate of two sweet spot I mean that was really the intent when I designed it and that's I think probably that's the difference in morus I would say is when I designed it it was as my experience as a coach for many years of testing lactate of V2 max testing of HRV testing I took a synthesize a lot of information that I gained and a lot of knowledge and insight I gained to create this structured system of low moderate and high intensity you can call them whatever you want to call them that's basically what the zones are and the biggest thing I realize is as people's autonomic nervous system changes intensity and heart put or heart rate changes and you learn this over time when you see today a 140 is doing this and tomorrow 140 might be doing that based on changes autonomic nervous system and so when I created the algorithm is was a space and a lot of data collected over a number of years of what I'd seen in the gym what I'd measured would then look back at the data and so that was the end result of

[01:00:53] Morpheus was trying to translate changes in internally with how we can then turn that into smarter more accurate precise training and that's what you you're seeing with morphia so it's awesome to hear that it's that accurate for you and some people it's always going to be much more accurate than others but as a whole

[01:01:08] Morpheus is by far the best way to translate you know again changes internally with changes we should be doing in the gym yeah I mean basically for our patients now we almost never bother with them checking lactate it's basically um RP if you can manage it if you really have a sense of what zone 2 feels like great um but if you want some guidance look take the maone formula 180 minus your age great place to start once you're getting a little more nuanced if you want more guidance use Morpheus and and and go to that go to that heart rate um again tell folks how I get that number every morning what am I how is it spitting out that number for me it's I have to do a measurement right yeah I mean you have to measure your HRV and then we're looking at other things that you've done in the past 24 hours if you're recording it um and then based on your Fitness level so we ascertain your

[01:01:58] Fitness level by looking at your resting heart rates by looking at your average RB by looking at some of your heart rate trends when you're training and we say Okay Peter's roughly at this level of Fitness Peter's autonomic nervous system is responding in this way which again con correlates to how it's going to react today if I'm fatigued then it's going to take more energy to produce the same level of power output and then we estimate like you said what for you is this cut off between low low intensity moderate intensity and high intensity and a way that people can think about this I would say is muscle fiber recruitment so low intensity is primarily slow twitch muscle Fiers is doing the majority of the work and specifically Zone 2 we're talking about where they're mostly oxidizing fat as much as possible kind of this moderate intensity we're starting to recruit some of those moderate threshold fibers we can talk about what that means but we're starting to recruit some of those those those faster twitch higher threshold muscle fibers and then higher intensity we're starting to really recruit all the muscle fibers and the highest intensity of muscle fibers and so as Morpheus is looking at this it's basically saying okay roughly this heart rate we think this is a level of intensity that is going to correspond to these low medium and high and then it's giving you the ability to just plug in Morpheus and say

[01:03:08] I want to do zone two Morpheus says okay based on what we've seen this is where we think your Zone 2 is for you today and other zones same thing yeah and again I just want to reiterate this is why it's very valuable like it's actually giving me the prescription every single day um when I got it I was a little surprised cuz I didn't you know

[01:03:26] I sort of bite it sight unseen I was just kind of told it's valuable but I didn't understand the Nuance so the thing shows up and I realize oh every morning I need to do a 2 and a half minute lay down in bed before I get up still test um measuring my heart rate and I guess you can do that Morpheus at the time came with a chest strap and an armband I think it now it's just a chest strap right so you put the chest strap on in bed you lay there um you answer a couple of questions so it wants to know how many hours did I sleep the night before so I pull that data off my sleep tracker my eight sleep and then I what's the quality of my sleep I'm pulling off that as well and then I think it's saying how sore am I uh subjectively and how good do I feel y the subjective markers yeah which again I I think those are actually reasonably validated markers for training performance they are um and then I measure I lay there and just kind of do nothing meditate usually and it measures my HR V and heart rate and then it spits out here's your HRV here's your heart rate here's your um basically your recovery score as a percent Y and then here are your

[01:04:38] Target Training zones which then come up again when you train that day it's already loaded into the app so your training zones change every day so one of the things that surprised me Joel was like wait a minute I'm used to having to measure HRV over the course of a night what is the difference between what my aura ring used to tell me by measuring over 8 hours of sleep versus this thing that's telling me in two and a half minutes in the morning before I've got up like how do you think about that yeah this is I think this is this is probably the most important part of HIV because there is so much confusion on this we look back historically all the data that's been used these all CA mortality studies and all the different pieces of liter out there 95% of them are from spot h measurements that where you're measuring at a specific time and you're doing this in standardized conditions as much as you can to get a baseline because we want to know where is your autonomic nerv system right now same time every day in the same conditions because what I want to know is last you know 24 hours you did something yesterday you did lots of things I assume you ate food you maybe worked out you maybe had alcohol or maybe you didn't you did mental stress or maybe didn't you put your body in a situation where it had to respond for for the majority of the day to do something and and then you went to bed and we want to see the result of that we want to see this stress and Recovery cycle that you went through yesterday because that tells us where your body is at right now how is it responding because we'll look at changes over time and understand how your body is is adapting to the world around you and that's what most HRV has been built on is we measure in standard conditions we see where you're at today and that informs us about what happened over the last 24 hours and and maybe slightly

[01:06:22] Beyond and the analogy is if I was going to weigh myself I'd want to weigh myself first time in the first in the morning in standard conditions I wouldn't want to have a meal and then go weigh myself I'd want to have very standard ways of measuring so I can see the changes because ultimately it's you changing against yourself that's the most informative so we wake up we measure HRV we see where you are and we see where you were what your averages have been what your variations have been and that tells us where you are today and that helps us make a decision about what are you ready to do right now or what's the most appropriate for you to do right now one thing I'll say is if your HIV is or low we can talk about what those mean it doesn't mean that you can't train hard it just might mean that like that might not be the most beneficial thing for you and there might be a cost associated with that if I wake up my HRV is way outside of normal you can't say oh I can't work out today you can you can it's just a question of is that what your body needs um but anyway if you sleep yeah to be clear I don't think

[01:07:15] I've I mean I don't think I have never once not exercised as a result of what that said and there have been days when I've had abysmal scores um and it's told me like my rate of what it my heart rate range on what it has told me is never above about 141 there have been days it's been as low as 121 which for me means like my recovery was 35 or 40% that's a night when I didn't sleep and something was dramatically off you'd still do the workout you still the workout right you just are aware of what the cost of that workout would be you might make adjustments tomorrow or through your plan um so any now that's what we're getting when we're measuring at the end of sleep right the morning time we're seeing what was the result of our sleep what a result of our workout so yesterday everything else we did if we're measuring HRV overnight HRV number one is always higher at night because the parasympathetic system is that dial has already turned up quite a bit because you're sleeping where it's the highest although for most people Joel they will see the reverse because like my rmssd HRV overnight is lower than the log normal transform I get out of

[01:08:20] Morpheus morphus if you look at the actual rsus D data you would see that you'd be higher I know Morpheus is is different OB can we see that in the app can we you can't right now we honestly when we first came out with Bio Force and Morpheus there weren't so many other apps to compare against so it wasn't as big a deal to not show the raw number um so we chose not to but now I think we probably will just because people do want to compare um but anyway overnight that dial of that Parish system is already higher so we're getting less of responsiveness to see what actually is changing at rest not measuring it rest the second thing is if you have arrhythmias if you're an athlete who has very KV you don't have as much variability we're not really gauging the true responsiveness of the 24 hours before we're measuring more of what's it doing during the recovery the recovery period which you know has some correlation obviously but we're not really seeing where are you at the end of that recovery period where are you ready to go today for this you know Next

[01:09:14] Period of stress and if you do here's the biggest thing is if you do something if you do a workout in the evening if you have a few glasses of wine if you're doing something very mentally challenging the first part of your sleep just responding to that and so your HRV is not reflective of this whole process it's just reflective of hey you just did a evening workout and your HRV is still suppressed for the first half of your sleep responding to that workout so we don't get a true picture of where am I at right now and how does that correlate to what I should be doing for the next you know 12 to 18 hours as I'm awake across the the next day so I think we're just we're probably getting much better gauge of sleep and how our body responding during sleep but we're not really getting this true picture how did our body go through the whole process of

[01:09:58] Life sleep recover next we don't see that picture as well because we're not measuring at the end of sleep we're getting this average across it so I don't think it's telling us really the same thing and it doesn't have the same utility we telling us from workout perspective what's the most appropriate thing for us to do uh might be a silly question but it occurred to me now as we were talking about this the one fundamental difference from one day to another in that morning check for me is there are some morning I wake up and I have to pee so badly and there are some mornings when I don't and there's a part of me that's wondering is I'm laying there doing my test while needing to pee is that putting a little more sympathetic tone into this am I getting a skewed measurement would I be better off going peeing coming back waiting a few minutes i' go to the bathroom get up there's not it's not that bad of a big of an issue if you just go up go to the bathroom you come back and you reestablish and part of that's actually measuring how well can you reestablish that if that if that significant impacted your HRV it probably was on a l in to begin with um but that does bring up a point I should mention people with really high hrvs I don't think this becomes an issue at least in Morp until you're in the 90s or resting heart rates in the low to mid- 40s your your HIV is already very very high that laying down you're taking something responsed this away if you start getting those categories you probably want to take it seated the challenge for most people seated they get antsy they move around you introduce more motion artifacts it becomes more difficult but we really want to have as much range that dial available as possible because we want to see how nervous system is turning that dial and so if you're very high like I said I would say someone who's resting heart rates yeah I'm never above I'm in the the low 80s is as high as I get yeah

[01:11:35] I think at that point laying down is still a good way to take it but if you get up in the 90s mid 90s you really want to maximize that potential responsiveness and that's where a seated measurement makes more sense but that's a fairly small percentage of the population that's going to be you know up in that ranges rmsd you're talking 120s 130s 150 we get up in those ranges you probably want to take it seated you also would say you what's when I bought the Morpheus a couple years ago you had an armband and a chest strap that came with it so I still use the armband as my morning check because I can I just that way I don't have to move them back and forth it always sits right there and then I use my chest strap when I'm exercising you've gone to just a chest strap is that because you think you're going to get better data and it's just better to have people using the chest strap for both and should I do the same

[01:12:22] I mean it's two things I don't think the data as long as you're measuring you know consistently and you have the chest or you have the armband placed correctly that's not any less accurate I don't think the problem we ran into as people as you know we're trying to use our armband to train because it's more convenient like oh the armband is like goes my wrist and their workout data was was just not as accurate the second thing is it looked like a watch but it wasn't a watch and so we had a bunch of confusion with people people putting it on their wrist people putting their wrist and not sure what to do with it it just created a lot of confusion so at the end of the day I said look the chest

[01:12:53] STP is giving us the best it's much it's unambiguous If people really want to wear an arm Bice device because they just don't want to put the chest rep on we work with the Rhythm the SC Rhythm 24 it uses the exact same sensor that Morpheus uh used in our original armband that you have and so if they want to do that they can they can measure that way but from a accuracy perspective from both the HRV and the workout it just made sense for us to standardize that use the chest strap and make it as as universal as possible rather than trying and sell two devices which people were ultimately somewhat unsure of yeah um okay so let's talk a little bit about the question that I'm sure is on everybody's mind which is uh

[01:13:32] I've been doing this for a while and I get that at the individual you know for my data my I see my up and down level and I know that hey when it's higher I'm generally going to perform better and I can push a little harder when it's lower I'm probably not going to perform as well and maybe need to make that a little bit more of a a less hard day um but but then you get this question of hey like what can I be doing to improve the quality of my health in a way that is measured by this output of HRV sure I mean this is where HRV is driven by like to genetics Fitness primarily cardiovascular fitness is the biggest thing we see Court drive it and then obviously lifestyle so doing things in your lifestyle that make that sympathetic dial come down when you don't need it and doing things that turn on that parasynthetic dial when you're not using this is going to put you in your highest level of your particular range right from a lifestyle perspective and that's where I think most people underestimate the lifestyle impact on

[01:14:34] HRV and train everything else they don't realize if you're stressed out from work 6 8 10 hours a day you're running around chasing your kids you're doing all these things and you know your daily life that has a pretty significant impact on your HRV because that sympathetic dial will be turned up for hours on end maybe not the same degree of course as a workout but hours on end so a lot of it comes down to just just the stuff we know in everyday life that makes us healthier right eating healthier foods making sure we're getting enough sleep managing our our mental stress effectively doing things allow us to relax and turn that parasympathetic dial back up and that sympathetic dial back up down and then build V2 Max you know use strength train to so do you think it's more impacted by

[01:15:16] Peak aerobic fitness or by uh base aerobic fitness so would you say it's more impacted by higher Zone 2 or a higher V2 mag I mean they both contribute exactly how much um you know I couldn't say because we don't we measure we tend to measure aerobic fitness from a peak stpoint for the most part so that's more standardized what we would look at but I think training frequency matters which is where you get Zone to right you can't do V2 Max training five six days a week we do a lot more Zone 2 we do a lot more frequency and volume of that and I think that translates uh more than likely into a higher V or into a higher HRV even if you didn't go out and do a bunch of the zone or the you know V2 max type work yeah um and then tell me a little bit about sort of the um like what as far as okay so one of the advantages I think of those overnight tests uh again whether it's

[01:16:12] Aura whoop eight sleep any of these things is uh uh people have noticed how much of an impact alcohol has on overnight HRV sure um it's probably one of the most profound changes you see in response to alcohol and I would argue that a big part of the movement we're seeing around people drinking less can be attributed to those devices which is giving people visibility into oh my God like you know I didn't realize that alcohol could have such a profound impact on this um is that something

[01:16:47] I I guess that would kind of be out of your system maybe the next day or would that still be there in the morning well it would depend in the sense of if you had alcohol close enough to bedtime yeah it's going to impact your sleep which impacts your recovery which will impact the more measurements you'll still see some some remnants of it for sure um but yeah you'll see that more directly in in the overnight stuff I think as a whole what we see is people become much more aware of things like alcohol things like excessive stimulants or you know God forbid smoking or you know just years of or massive amounts of chronic mental stress those things impact much more than I think people realize example of this we were measuring a college soccer team um across a couple seasons and we would see that during finals week they would look far worse than during tournaments even competitive like uh playoffs just because that stress of being you know in a finals week where you're studying and you're not sleeping and you're you know more stressed out and what give me a sense of the range that you would see what what what would you see in an like give me an average athlete where this would be their morning HRV under these circumstances this is what it looks like when they're overtrained this is what it looks like when when they're in the tournament this is what it looks like in finals yeah again there's a lot of variability there um but from a college standpoint most soccer athletes that we would see in these are female athletes be in the low mid 80s on a you know normal basis and this again this is Morpheus system that's you can't compare these other numbers um but they'd be in the low to mid 8s kind of as a normal range we see them drop into the 50s 60s sometimes even 7 no 70s sometimes down to 50s which is in Morpheus that's the stress yeah that was the stress of finals week it's two three four days of not getting much sleep and you know studying a lot and just working out very less or very sporadically probably compared to normal training sessions you just see the impacts of life being very very significant that people don't necessarily expect that because they feel like oh the workout is the most impactful thing well it is in a way but it's also only an hour maybe two hours it's the rest of your life that also adds up to a huge amount of stress if you are very very stressed and if you're going through your life you know in in that kind of type A I'm always turned on

[01:18:52] I can't turn off my stress that has a very big impact I think um you know spolski who I know you've had on the show talks a lot about the mechanisms like you see that play out pretty um frequently when you look at HIV data I don't utilize the Morpheus system fully because I only wear it during my zone2 workouts so I don't wear it when I'm doing my VO2 max workouts because I'm already wearing that polar system because it pairs with the Garmin and it pairs with the other power meters and all the other stuff I'm using um I guess

[01:19:22] I could double up I can you wear two chest straps I mean you could so you probably could the polar should be able to connect to the Morpheus app directly while you're training then it would have to pair to two apps it should be able to if it's got two Bluetooth radios which it probably does you probably could do both do that that would be good to know yeah um but I don't wear it when I'm strength training and um so so I I realize that

[01:19:45] I'm failing to give it all of the data CU that's another you know I don't wear it when I'm rucking I there's a lot of time I'm active but not wearing it so how much am I missing out on in terms of the Fidelity of what it might be telling me and I want to because I want to talk about the algorithm and how it's able to because I you know one of the things you and I spend so much time on is I can't make sense of How It's coming up with the numbers even though they end up being right most of the time yeah like the more data you give it obviously the better it's going to be um exactly how much you're losing and you know it's it's hard to say but we're we're measuring the output with that Sur change and with the numbers that you're putting into it so we know the output of where you are we can't always ascertain how you got there if we don't have all that dat at the workout sort of uh things but as long as we have that consistent HIV measurement every morning in standardized conditions you know we're still able to get the vast majority of what we're trying to get which is what are you most likely to do when you work out right now how so that is the most important thing that's by far the most important thing to make sure that every day you see my heart rate my heart rate variability how long

[01:20:54] I slept how sore I am in my desire to train yeah that's the vast majority of it because again it's telling us where you are right now the readout State the readout right now it that's the output we know the output this is where your body is is at right now if we can reverse engineer that from the input we can have some more insight into that but you're not like losing a bunch of accuracy because you didn't get that we we want the output we want that as standardized and accurate as possible so

[01:21:17] I would say as long as you're measuring consistently every morning the same context same conditions it's going to be more than accurate for what you want to do okay great and again my use case is quite simple which is mostly just predicting that zone to but I have a feeling a lot of people listening to us will immediately you know resonate with that use case because I think for many people there's still a little bit of ambiguity on not the concept of what zone 2 feels like but the day-to-day variation which again is really significant that speaks to the body's

[01:21:47] Dynamic you know I think we we can do a zone two tests and look at lactate and all these things if we just take one test we don't realize how much the body changes on a daily basis and so if you're just okay I took my lactate test 6 months ago I'm just using the static Zone 2 you're missing that Dynamic change that body is going through on a daily basis the body is not static I I measure blood pressure I measure testosterone I measure like all these numbers change constantly like the body doesn't sit still and I want to make another point which is people again might be listening and saying you know

[01:22:15] Peter man it's too much data dude just go out there and do it and and I'll I'll give you the counterargument to that when I was a competitive athlete and I was training 28 hours a week I had the luxury of junk miles I didn't always have to be perfect but I'm not a competitive athlete I'm a competitive father I you know I'm running three businesses like I don't have the time for nonsense every minute I'm training I have to get the training stimulus right or at least as close to write as possible so when I'm setting out to do

[01:22:51] Zone 2 I got to do it and if I'm out there Trucking along and my lactates 1.1 or 2.9 I'm missing the training effect I want so the more insight I can get to narrow that down the better because I'm I'm only going to give three hours a week or four hours a week to that training I'm not going to put 12 hours into it where if I do 12 hours and I screw up three of them who cares I still got nine so so that's why I I know that there are people watching this saying dude you're a psycho and it's like no

[01:23:23] I'm just efficient with my time and I don't want to waste my time I I think what it comes down to is each person has a certain amount of training in a week they're I like I think it's a weekly basis right because that's kind of the cycle we live in there's an amount and a type and an intensity of training that you are individually going to respond the best to and if you go above it not so great things are going to happen if you go below it you're you're not going to get the output that you want and that amount is not easy to find and it changes on a weekly basis it's not the same week in week out and so the more that you can hone in on that core how much volume do I need and how much intensity do I need if you can get that right week in and week out you will see continual improvements and that work will turn into result if you don't answer that correctly bad things happen you either waste your time because you're not getting as much out of as you could or you do end up overtrained in which case we see injuries and we see burnout and lots of things that are going to have negative Health consequences so I think ultimately what you said is I want to use information to make sure that I'm getting the most bang for my buck the best result for the amount of work I'm put in and that's where I think data can play a really powerful role is it's information that you can use to make much more granular decisions around rather than just guessing oh I should go do 40 minutes today should you or I should do 200 minutes this week is there anything to support that other than just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks and I think that's what intrigued me so much about HRV is it felt like I could open the black box and get some real answers other than like test train for eight weeks REM measure see what happened I don't want to wait 8 weeks I don't want to potentially lose the gains

[01:24:59] I could have made across that time period so for someone like yourself that's again wanting to get as much out of their time as they possibly can yeah data can play a really strong role in that because can answer questions that can't be answered otherwise yeah and and I think it only gets more significant as we age you know when I was 40 my recovery capacity was so much greater than now never mind 3020 that's obvious but but even the difference between 40 and 50 is is significant and um I know there are a lot of people listening to us right now who can relate right they're sort of like hey I'm getting a little bit older I don't feel as great as I did so it's it's a question of time and Age and and I think the further we get along that the more this type of system um again for me I I

[01:25:41] I I can't say enough about it yeah age reduces your margin of error what it comes down to I mean I'm 44 and you know you can do a lot of things wrong in you're 20s and maybe 30s and you can still get a lot of benefit out of it because you just can you're so resilient your metabolism will adapt but like you said the older you get the the less you can do that and so you you have to be much more acutely aware of what your body can and can't do and that's part of what HRV can help you understand you said something maybe 20 30 minutes ago and I I jotted a note down because I didn't want to um derail us at the time but I'll come back to it now so um when

[01:26:12] I'm doing my V2 Max sets the thing I monitor for every set is heart rate recovery so as soon as I get to the top because I do those on a hill so as soon I get to the top of the hill I hit a timer I hit the lap timer and I count how many beats does my heart rate go down in the first 60 seconds at the completion of the interval and that's a great proxy for how I'm doing um so I've got kind of my normal range should be 30 to 35 on a really good day I'm 40 to 45 and a week ago or so I had like one of the worst days I've ever had where I was like 19 to 21 in a minute that's all I could recover I mean I was smoked uh now

[01:26:54] I didn't sleep the night before so I think you know I made an Instagram post about it because I thought it was just a great sort of illustrative teaching point you said something that made me wonder about another test would there be any utility in right after a V2 Max interval doing an art heart rate variability test to see how much sympathetic tone can I dial down and how much how much parasympathetic tone can I dial up after what's probably a peak you know a very high sympathetic low parasympathetic you can you can do that actually I mean it's very specific like you can't move around if you want to get some standardization to it so yeah you could you could do a 10 15 minute recovery period Steven Syler the guy what if I just did it right at the top like literally would that be too much prob probably I think honestly I think heart rate recovery is illustrative well it's illustrative of what you wanted to get to because what we see is heart rate recovery is driven by what the reactivation the balance of those two it's turning the sympathetic down as quickly as possible and turning the

[01:27:53] Vegas parasympathetic up as fast as possible so heart rate recovery has already given you that information without having to get as granular as pulling out the you don't necessarily have to get that level of detail you can just see the heart rate drop and that drop is being caused by the increase in heart rate variability and what's really fascinating is they used to think and this is pretty new research I was going through we used to have this idea that when your heart rate increased above 100 beats per minute that there was really no vagus input there was almost no parasympathetic and and they figure that because they would look at acetyl choline as essentially they could block it into the heart and they' say oh we block acetyl choline from Vegas and heart still pumps just fine during their exercise exercise must not be vasly driven at all but what they found is that the Vegas might actually be turned up a bit during exercise in some sense because it can increase coronary blood flow by increasing vasal dilation in the coronary artery and so HRV is probably not the Vegas I should say is probably not completely no it's probably not completely off it's it's this ratio it could be turned up but the sympathetic system it's turned up so much more and it's using a different mechanism we don't see the heart rate reil high obviously but it's probably more ready to turn that back up even further as soon as that sympathetic system starts turning down and we're dropping our you know our adic hormone levels our catacol amines all these things are dropping pretty quickly and the faster we can turn that parasympathetic up the faster heart rate comes down the other thing is interesting is they've looked at heart recovery in terms of it represents to some extent the balance of the aerobic and anerobic systems that contributed to that exercise so the more aerobically driven something was the faster heart rate drops because in a lot of ways higher heart rates are driven by that sympathetic and by the anerobic pieces of metabolism so what do you see in young exceptional athletes I mean I I wish I had tracked this metric when I was a teenager like I wish I know how much my heart rate recovered then um back when my Peak heart rate was 205 to 210 uh what what do you see 60 from Max so yeah I trained combat athletes UFC fighters fighters for many many years and they have to go into the

[01:30:07] Octagon or cage ring depending on what they're doing and they have to fight for three five minute rounds to five five minute rounds probably a 10-minute round which is crazy um and so we would use heart rate recovery between rounds as a really good G it's one minute between rounds rounds yes exactly and they would sit down between rounds so we could standardize that and so I would use that drop as a very good gauge of how well conditioned is this athlete how ready to go out there give me an example of what you would see on a fighter they would come out of the previous round at what

[01:30:36] I'd want they'd come out 160 180 depend I mean could be depends what the round was was like the end the round was slower it's going to be much slower but most of the rounds were between like 160 180 depending on their their age everything else you might they could drop by 50 to they would I would want them to get to 130s between each round we we' simulate this in sparring rounds getting leading up the fight we wouldn't measure it during the fight obviously but if they're doing a simulated fight round to where it's three FS or 55s I want them to be able to drop in the 130s between every round if we started seeing their first round they weren't coming down below 150 160 they're not in good enough shape they're not good enough shape they were they were going to fatigue every time and that just told us they were having to rely so much on the anerobic piece they were going to fatigue because at at a sport like this and where you have to be really explosive but you have to also have the endurance it's about the ratio of energy utilization it matters so much if you don't have enough anerobic you're going to lack power and speed and you know ability to finish but if you have not enough aerobic you're not going to sustain that explosive power for very long and so it's really tricky to get that ratio right and you see the fastest most explosive uh hardest hitting athletes often fatigue the fastest because they're generating that from the

[01:31:43] Anor robic side and they're relying on that and that's great if they can win and they can knock the person out or submit them but if they can't and you get in the leader rounds that's where they're going to really struggle versus somebody else who's more aerobically dominant so that's a really hard part about that sport is getting that ratio correct and training the right side of it um but the heart rate recovery was such a great way to see that and so like

[01:32:04] I said I would want to see in sparring at least you know there going to be higher heart rates during competition from the psychological stress but we want to see them drop in the 130s again this is seated going from standing to seated but they should be able get the heart rate back in the 130s between each round ideally before they go for a fight if they could do that and they were fighting high level Pace you knew they were in pretty good condition and they'd be ready to go out and go if they weren't doing that especially if the early rounds if they're like I said round one they're at 150 160 you know they better finish the fight quickly they're going to be in trouble yeah oh that's so interesting um I want to go back to kind of what we were talking about on the the trailing average of HRV data so again I I think the so I'm glad to hear that my failure to utilize

[01:32:48] Morpheus in every moment of the day isn't really impeding its Fidelity I kind of know know that because again as I said it just it's so damn accurate in what it predicts it's like a shaman um but what amazes me and what I'm you you you have the patience of a saint Joel because I email you so much it must be infuriating but what amazes me is how sometimes the data I see I don't believe it and you you're always like yep but you got to look back at what it did 7 days ago and 6 days ago and 5 days ago and so walk me through kind of the The Arc of the HRV over time and how you know the undulation of the HRV matters as much as the HRV on a given day this is this is the part that is totally news to me and and again I I think the proof is in the pudding because at least for me this seems to really work sure yeah I mean again we're looking at not just what is your number but what is your number in relation to where you're usually at and we're looking at how much does our number move today versus what's like a normal movement for you and again we're looking at just this manipulation of dials by the autonomic nervous system so what morphis is doing is looking at your seven days and seeing okay what's kind of your normal Baseline number itself but also what's your normal level of variability across those different time periods and then we look at standard deviation and so if we see big changes greater than one standard deviation away from your average away from your

[01:34:22] Baseline we know that that's the automic N system responding to a greater input it's it's responding to more stress and it's having to make bigger dial adjustments and that tells us that you've been paying a higher cost because you put your body under more stress if we were to probably illustrate to just isolate like let's say we put our like our body's in kind of a normal rested

[01:34:42] State let's say and then we do a single workout and we allow it whatever necessary time it needs to recover during the workout obviously the body turns up that sympathetic dial it turns down that parasympathetic dial we produce more Force more energy more power blah blah blah and then after the workout like we talked about the sympathetic system starts to come down the parasympathetic starts to come back up now depending on the workout you did that could happen in very different time scales and Steven Styler again who really popularized polar train he was just showing some stuff if you do like zone two and Below aerobic work that recovery happens pretty quickly within a few hours we'll see that parastic system turn on and it'll come up above your

[01:35:24] Baseline to maybe 110 120% of what your H HRV was at rest so Morpheus you know if you were I don't know a 70 if you were if you were to theoretically remeasure it you might be a 74 or 75 you would see a noticeable uptick above Baseline because our body has been able to shift very quickly into that restorative phase by that vagus nerve firing more forcefully and turning up the parasympathetic so we see again suppression during the workout and this curve starting to come back up during lower intensity workouts we'll see it pretty quickly come up above Baseline and then kind of as your body went through that complete cycle and restored homeostasis and did what it wanted to do and then just kind of settle back down to where it started and so you'd see this curve this very clear curve now in a much higher int but the amplitudes aren't as big the amplitudes aren't as big exactly and in a much higher intensity higher volume even even lower intensity see don't to three hours of in heat right that's a much bigger stress you see the same curve but it play out over a much longer time scale because it would take much longer for the body to restore back to where it was and then to get everything where you started with from a HRV standpoint so we'd see a much bigger depression a much lower uh drop and then we'd see a much longer time scale for it to come back up to normal and then we might see it come up above normal for some period and then and then restore but I'll say there's a big difference in the individual as well people with higher HRV and people are more fit they're more likely to see this increase above Baseline somebody who has less autonomic range they can't quite turn that Paras dial up as much they might never get up above Baseline they might just kind of spend time getting back to that Baseline HRV and you never really see the peak above Baseline and then the restored afterwards so it's it's an individual thing based on

[01:37:07] Fitness but we should generally see suppression of HRV an increase of HRV and then kind of a back to normal HRV it's that process now the tricky thing comes is we have so many other things influence it alcohol influences it mental stress influences it sleep influences it so it's over overlapping influences that will get to where you're seeing but that's the core thing of our body response to stress by dropping HRV and then by recovering HRV and then be by coming back to whatever that normal range is yeah and that's why again I think it's not intuitive enough to just look at the HRV that given day you can't just say my HRV was X today and there's a onetoone map between what my HRV is on a given day and what my training output should be that day exactly because you need to know the first derivative the second derivative and frankly even the

[01:37:56] The Arc that it's on yeah it's it's it is it's it's an all cause you know metric that's not just looking at one input it's looking at everything and so interpreting that output is not always the easiest thing in the world and again if you kind of look at this like oh up is always one thing and down it's always one thing it's a little more nuan than that because it's again it's this responsiveness of okay it's going to drop after peer stress then going come back up it might come up way above

[01:38:19] Baseline and then kind of drop back down to normal you know this curve is not always the most intuitive thing to understand and and that's part of the challenge I think with people just kind of looking at it and say oh it's this I'm going to go do that yeah I mean it's it's it's certainly not intuitive to me which is why I annoy the hell out of you and pepper you with all these questions um I want to change gears to talk about something that I've I've alluded to a couple of times in the past which is a phenomenon that we see in patients taking this new class of drug I mean it's not really a new class of drug it's been around for a decade but a class of drug that has gained a lot of popularity in the past probably two to three years which are the glp1 agonists and the um the Dual the Dual Agonist with Gip as well and again we don't have an enormous and overwhelming body of evidence on this you know we don't have that many patients in our practice and we frankly don't have that many that take it but certainly over the past three years uh you know I have to think we've seen two dozen patients on these drugs and again in all cases we have overnight information on heart rate and heart rate variability and so the unambiguous sign that we see is that resting heart rate is going up um and it's going up an average of 10 beats per minute with a range of about 8 to 12 uh and again this is unmistakable it's not subtle and when they come off the drug usually within a month it goes back to normal uh for patients who do indeed go off the drug we're also seeing a compression of heart rate variability so we see heart rate variability come down although that's less predictive but I now realize we're kind of using the standard we're not using like a Morpheus we're using kind of the aura ring or whatever and you know maybe those data just aren't as accurate um so my first question for you is if there's something going on in a drug that is predictably driving heart rate up would you expect it is also driving heart rate variability down do those tend to move in that that generally speaking you'd see that now just as you mentioned that my thought would be it's a strong appetite suppressant correct the Vegas is very tied to appetite so if you think about this if we were to turn up that sympathetic dial our hunger gets turned down we don't really want to be hungry while we're in the middle of some stressor right but after that period of stressor is over theoretically we've burned energy we need to restore and eat and so the Vegas is very connected to the gut and to hunger centers and it feeds up into medulla and it's control hypothalamus there's a very strong vagal relationship to hunger and the desire to eat so I almost wonder if suppressing the Vegas and decreasing uh

[01:41:03] HRV and increasing heart rate is a byproduct of how this is inhibiting appetite yeah interest sense and and so it's an interesting question because it it it it it then leads to another question which is if I told you that I'm going to change you in a way that you're heart rate is 10 beats higher and your HRV is 10 milliseconds lower you would say well whatever you did was negative sure I mean there's a cost to that right right do we think that that could be the case here I mean again we're really wildly speculating but but this is you know I get asked all the time Peter are these drugs safe are these drugs good what do you think of them and I'm always say sort of the same thing which is look clearly for some people whatever unknown exists around these drugs is worth it right like if you're if an individual you know goes from being 250 lb to 200 lb and having a hemoglobin A1c of 7% to 5.5% that is so positive for them that I think it justifies whatever unknown exists around these drugs if there's no other way they're going to achieve that benefit um but I'm really more interested in these marginal cases of people who don't have diabetes and want to lose 20 lbs which by the way might not really matter over Health it's cosmetic and are they taking too big a risk that that's kind of the question

[01:42:29] I'm interested in and that's why I keep coming back to if it raises your heart rate that much and lowers your heart rate variability is there is it is it doing so is that are we picking up a signal that is just a niche representation of appetite suppression via the Vegas nerve or is it actually playing a role in the parasympathetic sympathetic dials I would imagine it's it's got to be I mean to move it that large 10 beats is a fairly significant amount I would can't imagine that's not having an actual effect on our ability to regulate ourselves effectively we're probably in a more sympathetic State all the time which is going to have a cost now if it's a few weeks or a month you know maybe that cost is relatively small

[01:43:13] I don't know um but if it's weeks or months and the they're they're living on this drug yeah there's I would suspect there's a real cost to that and to your point if it's the benefit is they lose a bunch of weight and all their blood markers improve and we see Health outcomes maybe it's certainly worth that cost but maybe somebody like you said who cosmetically wants to lose weight and they have an easier time on the drug at doing that you know is that a net benefit I mean it's hard to say because we don't have long-term studies on those drugs um but I would just kind of say in general that yeah if we see these noticeable decreases in HRV and these very noticeable increases in heart rate that's a real sign that the body is is the autonomic nervous system is being adjusted in an artificial way and that probably is not a good thing in the long run specifically if it's for a long time yeah I um I don't know where the companies are at in terms of their uh post surveillance uh meaning post marketing surveillance studies and if this is a metric that they're tracking or interested in but um again given the popularity of these drugs like there's no shortage of opportunities to to kind of measure these things yeah it' be interesting to see like also I'd be curious what happens when they come off do we see a big rebound is our heart rate stay suppressed is it you know again our sample size is so small that I want to be very careful and note that you know everything I'm saying is you know again it could be nothing it could be that you know it's just a very small n and you know 25 people is not enough but the thing is in the 25 people I've never seen an exception so that's you know when you don't need statistics to measure things you kind of need to pay a little closer attention to it's pretty hard to modulate uh appetite that significantly without suppressing the

[01:44:53] Vegas to some extent it's so closely connected but we do see everything come back to normal when people are off the drug um and I'm trying to remember it's been a while since I've looked I feel like it's within a month maybe even less it might be within two weeks Everything Has Come very long on those so it probably does take a few weeks to clear out um and I don't think I have enough insight to contrast the two most popular drugs semaglutide and tepati um but again I don't think these drugs are going anywhere and would love to better understand this um my guess is there are a number of people on these drugs that might not be aware of this because either they're just not tracking it or they are but they haven't they haven't noticed it you know I some patients will say this after a few months and I realized they kind of forgot when I told them this in the first place um but anyway wondering if you had seen anything about that or heard anything about it but yeah I mean you see it like I mean ADHD medications for example got it you see a very suppressed HIV and a very elevated uh sympathetic arrest in heart rate you see in several type of things like that any sort of strong stimulant obviously those are not stimulants but people who live on caffeine and Red Bull and are constantly um shoving coffee like to constantly turn that sympathetic dial up is to me a kind of sign that the sympathetic system isn't working the way that it should by itself probably because you've over stimulated to begin with through stress and a lack of ability to turn that off and we see people reach for stimulants and artificial ways of turning that sympathetic dial up once they're their body's not doing it the way that it should and so you know we see people kind of self-medicate with stimulants to to get that sympathetic response when if they had been able to manage stress more effectively they probably would have a normally normal functioning sympathetic system that wouldn't need that artificial stimulus to to turn it up let's take a step back and now just talk about where you think HRV belongs in the hierarchy of Health metrics um we we've talked about so many different types of

[01:46:49] Health metrics and we've talked about how output metrics tend to be preferable you know we can sort of think of them as functional metrics um you know I like an oral glucose tolerance test more than a hemoglobin A1c one is kind of functional it actually is a test it watches how you do something V2 max strength those are more functional tests than maybe resting heart rate or uh muscle mass right muscle mass is great it's predictive as is resting heart rate but when you actually put the workout um HRV is obviously a readout State what where do you think on the dashboard of Health longevity uh where do you where do you place it you know I think it's important to monitor as you're going along but I would say if all your other metrics are telling you you're healthy and you're going the right direction nine times out of 10 it's we tell you the same thing the the point where I would be more uh aware of it is where it's very low and you don't have a reason for that you want to figure that out we've had people have rhythmia they had no idea about and they go to the doctor and there and have some serious heart condition that they need to be aware of but I would just say long term it's it should line up with V2 it should line up with your metabolic

[01:47:58] Market it should line up with all of this stuff it's easier to track because we can measure on a daily basis I think that's probably the advantage I would say it has is you're not getting a V2 Max test every day obviously every week every month you know you're not doing lactate testing you're not doing these markers that are more output based that are really important frequently enough to get feedback of whether or not you're going the right direction so I think we can look at HRV in a more granular daily basis just kind of say am I going the right direction and that's probably more of a utility than a great predictor of you know something and we can look at those daily changes to help us make more informed decisions we can't do that with

[01:48:34] V2 Max or with you know more invasive tests so it it's a more uh you know narrow data point but it gives us something we can use more actionably than these longer term tests I think are better actual measures of outcome and if we see our HIV trending down significantly that is a warning sign we're doing something wrong our body is not adapting the way that it should be and we need to make adjustments whether it's the training or or lifestyle so I think it's used differently right like we use V2 and we use uh those sorts of output measures as are we going the right direction and we have some prognostic value specifically from them we use HRV to say you know are we more likely to be making improvements on the short term or are we heading the wrong direction where if we keep doing that for a long period of time we're going to either see the benefit or the cost depend which direction we're going so I think they're different is there a number Joel on the um the log normal transformation you're doing on the rmssd a number below which if it's consistently there you think that you know I would I would want to inquire more 50s 40s I mean those are those are pretty low numbers for for again just for folks listening that's not the rmssd number right the rmssd number might be far far lower than that exactly yeah so you you really do have to be specific of what we're talking about the systems um but yeah I mean this is a you know n of one but I was at a guy there was Mel who you probably aren't familiar with but he was a very well-known Sports scientist he wrote a book called Super train I at his house with the original uh HRV system I was using and I had all the metrics and his army was like five and he just looked really bad you know I said and he heart had a heart attack and

[01:50:15] I said well this looks really concerning he was you know he kind of brushed it off and he died of a heart attack you know a few months later and so you know if you're really seeing these super low rmssd or Morpheus numbers like it's definitely indication that that autonomic nerv system is not responding well to the world around it and if it's really really low you know there could be a legitimate medical concern that's driving that so if you're you know

[01:50:38] Morpheus 40s 30s and you you're just not getting up it's probably worth looking into and it's something to definitely be concerned about and do you see the opposite where really high numbers or a sudden change from low to high can indicate an arhythmia or something like that yeah absolutely you definitely do see these these kind of weird numbers come out you know that could be arhythmia that could be medications that could be who knows you see some of these these things jump around from anomalies that you just kind of like it's an artifact I don't know what happened and then sometimes you do see a medication or you you see weird stuff with Co and you definitely see some weird stuff in the data that you want to be aware of that you know you probably wouldn't pick up otherwise I would say HIV is more of a leading indicator and kind of how you feel and some of those symptoms can come days later so you'll times pick up something that looks weird and then two days later you get a cold or you get flu or you get some sort of uh thing that explained it Joel this is awesome I honestly I feel like I know much more about this now than even after I did the

[01:51:35] AMA a couple of years ago and I I learned a lot to to sort of prepare for that so um appreciate it I and and again you know I apologize because on some level this for some of the listeners Probably sounds like a bit of a Morpheus commercial at times but uh you know obviously I have no affiliation with

[01:51:51] Morpheus um at all um but I point to it because again I'm a big consumer of data I test every device out there extensively um and I I view it as the you know the stickiest device I've ever found for this use case and so I do hope that people check it out I think I just bought it online it's a you buy it direct to Consumer right I don't think you buy it on Amazon or whatever um so you know I I would encourage people to if they want to take this to another level that that that they should uh that they should check out uh morus I appreciate the work you're doing Joel I think it's um it it's you know your your the Curiosity and Inquisition with which you bring to this is fantastic um I I benefit from it greatly and and those are my patients who use it also as well so thank you for both you know all the work you're doing and obviously coming here to talk about it yeah know I appreciate being on here and being able to speak to your audience I think the biggest thing I've learned after you know 20 po user coaching is we're all different um and as much as it may be easy or or attracted to say oh this is what somebody else is doing let me just try that let me just do the same thing if you can spend the time just copycatting someone else's workout and really dig into your own physiology how you respond to training how you respond to diet how you respond to different food intakes really learn how your physiology works you know you will reap the reward of that in the long run I think that's where you know tools like

[01:53:19] HRV and sleep monitors they they build awareness and what they're using morphus or Ura or whatever else using that data to really be your own coach and really understand your own uh physiology and your own biology that's the ultimate way to get better results and and have the health outcomes you're looking for so I appreciate the opportunity to talk about that thanks Joel thank you [Music]
