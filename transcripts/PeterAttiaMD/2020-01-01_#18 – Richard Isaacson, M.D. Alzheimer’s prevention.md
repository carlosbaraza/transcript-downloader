[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:40] hey everyone welcome to this week's episode of the Peter attea drive this week I have the privilege of interviewing a good friend a collaborator and an all-round interesting dude named Richard Isaacson Richard is a neurologist who specializes in Alzheimer's disease he is the director of the Alzheimer's prevention clinic at Cornell here in New York City his life has been touched by Alzheimer's disease and from a very early age as

[00:01:09] Richard describes he felt a calling to go into neurology it is clearly his life's work he's an absolute expert in Alzheimer's disease but specifically has chosen to focus his efforts on the prevention of Alzheimer's disease as opposed to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and actually this puts him in the minority of neurologists professionally as I said he's an associate professor of neurology at

[00:01:31] Cornell Medical College here in the city he's also an attending neurologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital he grew up not too far from here in Long Island or there abouts and actually one of my favorite little tidbits I learned about him is he went to a high school called chronic high school and he was recently named among the most distinguished alumni so his photo now hangs alongside fellow recipients Rosie O'Donnell and

[00:01:56] Bob Costas so that's pretty impressive he's a little bit of a Doogie Howser started college at 17 finished medical school at 23 so as I think I point out in the podcast he finished medical school before I actually started medical school did his internship in Miami before ultimately doing his training at

[00:02:12] Beth is real and Harvard ultimately he has wound his way back to New York and as we get into great detail in this podcast about what his work is and I think more importantly how it can help people listening to this or their loved ones and also I think we I think are very open about the limitations in this space and what we do and don't know Richard has developed and I should say Richard and his team let's be honest like all great people they're sort of surrounded by a team of great people they've developed something called a lzu so it's wwa LZ letter you org which might be one of the single most important resources for people with Alzheimer's disease or early cognitive impairment and their family members so we'll obviously link to that very prominently but I think that's something that will if you take nothing else from this podcast other than a sort of visit to a lzu org that would be terrific Richard and I get into a lot of stuff I think this podcast probably runs about two and a half hours and we talked at the initial part by the way we get into something that was not at all planned but when Richard came over I don't think at all the time I've known Richard which has been about three and a half or four years I didn't notice how much he was into like bling phones and when he whipped his phone out I just couldn't stop laughing so the first like ten minutes of this podcast are us talking about this ridiculous thing that

[00:03:28] I hope we have pictures of to link to in the show notes obviously the show notes are usually time-stamped so you can skip past the patty-cakes and get to the meat of the discussion should you want but that said I can't highly enough recommend listening to Richard talk about his slot machine addiction and his funny phones we talk about the etiology of Alzheimer's to the best of our ability to understand it we talk about the incidence prevalence and the distinction between those two we talked quite a bit about the distinction between men and women as some of you may know there seems to be a bias towards women getting Alzheimer's disease more commonly than men and both Richard and I agree that that's probably not just an artifact of women living longer there must be something else going on there and we explore that topic we go into great detail about what we believe the state of the evidence is which admittedly at this point is still relatively early about what steps people can take to reduce their risk of Alzheimer's disease and we get really into the semantics of this what is the difference between risk reduction and prevention and we talk all about the politics of that and how those have changed we give when I say we meaning I discussed with Richard and Richard gives a great overview and primer on apoE we've had a lot of questions on a Bowie and we've deliberately punted those from the AMA because I knew that this discussion with Richard was coming up so for many of you to have questions about the apoE gene I think you'll find that interesting and I'll tell you something that I learned even in this discussion was so much of the subtlety around other genes that are named and unnamed at this point or snips that we know about versus don't know about that also seem to be predisposing to Alzheimer's disease unfortunately this is a disease that is going to touch pretty much everybody who's gonna listen to this podcast indirectly or directly in other words if you're listening to this there's a non-trivial chance that you already know somebody who's afflicted with

[00:05:24] Alzheimer's disease and tragically there's an even greater likelihood that at some point you will whether it be a parent a loved one or a friend or something like that so I'm relatively unabashed my praise for Richard's work and I'm relatively shameless in my plugging for people to fund this type of research the type of research that Richard does is relatively unsexy people don't really know what to do with clinical research that is focused on Alzheimer's prevention and probably somewhere in the vicinity of like ten basis points worth of resources meaning like 1/10 of 1% of resources are going into funding this type of work and after this podcast

[00:06:05] Richard and I went out for dinner and we talked about a gift that a patient of mine gave Richard was about a $50,000 gift or a $40,000 gift which is obviously a lot of money but in the grand scheme of the types of dollars that people are pouring into this research it's not that much and Richard was able to walk me through what came of that gift from that particular patient and I was so blown away that I got I came home from dinner and I actually emailed him to tell him the impact of his actual dollars and I will say this having spent a lot of my time around biomedical research it is very rare that a $40,000 gift can move the needle so if anybody's listening to this and they do feel touched and compelled to get involved in this space whether it just be through the standpoint of education and understanding or through funding research I think Richards team at Cornell is doing exceptional work so finally I'll just close by saying a couple of housekeeping things one there's a weekly email that has grown immensely in popularity so I want to make sure that people who are interested in receiving such an email know about it you can sign up for it on the site every

[00:07:05] Sunday morning I shoot out an email that kind of highlights things that are interesting to me over the course of the week I promise to do my best to make it not lame such that it's actually an email worth receiving remember on the show notes for this podcast and every podcast are always found on our website and we put an unbelievable amount of time into that in fact more time goes into that then goes into the podcast the podcast you know 2 and 1/2 hour discussion I might spend 2 hours preparing for it Bob and Travis two of our analysts spend double-digit hours preparing those show notes and the feedback has been excellent so for those of you that maybe aren't utilizing those it's might be something to consider and of course if you do find this enjoyable by all means please go to Apple leave a nice review on iTunes and I guess you can leave a review if you don't like it as well but I won't push you quite as hard so without further ado welcome to my interview with dr. Richard Isaacson

[00:07:59] Richard thanks so much for coming over man sure thanks for having me it's not a far walk isn't four minutes very well what do you think of the coaster I gave you I don't know if that was intentional but we have someone with dementia pugilistica on the coaster Muhammad Ali and my brother's a Parkinson's specialist so he would be the right one to talk to you but uh yeah amazing guy

[00:08:17] I gave you my Muhammad Ali coaster without even thinking about the implications of that serendipity or synchronicity which one is that I'm not sure okay so before we start this I just learned something about you today that I I've known you for a while I thought I knew everything but as we were just getting ready to record I was like oh by the way let's just stick our phones on airplane mode and you whip out your iPhone and you put on airplane mode and then you whipped out this white and gold diamond studded thing yeah can you tell our listeners what that thing was well

[00:08:47] I'm a very practical guy so I collect luxury vintage self it doesn't connect to the internet every 75 text messages the memory gets full so I have to delete them all it's very practical yeah I collect vintage luxury cell phones the word collect implies you have more than just that white seven that's seven yeah describe what it has on it well it's aside the alligator skin on the back sure it's white alligator came from Africa then went to Italy and then a skin was then shipped to the UK I had to get all the passport all the paperwork because it got stuck in customs for Fish and Wildlife had that phone in customs for like three or four weeks when I ordered it because they couldn't verify that that wasn't an endangered species so they found all the paperwork then I had to get the paper trail of where the fabric came from it's alligator white alligator it was actually assembled though the phone was assembled in the UK and it's got white sapphire keys it's a pseudo blackberry it's actually a Nokia the Nokia is actually from 2008 the phone was built in 2010 in 2010 this was the fattest phone on the market so that's pH pH fattest of the young people with a pH yes so we have white sapphire keys we have 18 carat gold the trim white alligator of course say that a few times around dating anyone at the time you got this you're very perceptive actually wait I didn't talk about the diamonds it's called a diamond pillow am I allowed to include a picture of this thing in the show notes solutely I'm looking at it as you're describing it and I can't frickin believe everything you're saying except that I'm looking at it so I know that whoever's listening to this right now is thinking what are these two clowns talking about but they need to see this thing it's called like a diamond pillow like that's what they marketed s but anyway it's on airplane mode so I can keep it on the table no I please keep it on the table because that thing is fan pose wait check this out the ringer there's no joke I mean

[00:10:34] I'm being recorded so you can like verify this but the ringer for these phones was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra specifically for this phone line I have to ask how much did that cost in two thousand ten dollars in 2010 it was just over twenty five thousand however I got it in an auction on eBay oh no you know what this one I actually got so the company went out of business last year that's right and they were liquidating the company server to

[00:10:57] VTR to you and the company went out of business last July they had a blowout auction sale liquidation sale so I was the highest bidder two people beat me but then they'd never paid the money so then long story short I was the highest bidder I won the phone in September I didn't get it till January because of the customs and all of oh wait wait so you didn't actually buy this in 2010 couldn't afford it - yeah okay okay I was gonna say coz but in 2011 I had a girl for ex girlfriend it was very that kind of whatever and I went to Vegas and I won $1600 in Vegas you were a huge slot machine guy if I recall yes although when I first met you

[00:11:33] Jay Walker burst my bubble and said it's all luck in random and I could have sworn it wasn't my uncle lives in Vegas my grandfather was in Vegas so he taught me the way of slot machines and I thought I beat slot machines until Jay Walker that has like 700 slot machine randomization code passwords or patents basically said no it's all luck he burst my bubble but anyway I was in Vegas like

[00:11:52] Vegas I go about every year every other year and I won $1,600 I was like oh yeah there's this luxury cell phone store and I'm gonna go buy the phone to impress the girl that I was hanging out with so we go and I put the phone we take it out it was 86 hundred dollars not $1600 so I actually did buy one sticker price for $8,600 that being said I and just to make sure I understand this you walked in there with 1,600 in your pocket ready to give away your winnings cuz it's free money the guy whips it out it's 8600 you can't back away now cuz the girl you're trying to impress you have no idea how many questions I want to ask you but we will not end up talking about

[00:12:31] Alzheimer's disease or dementia so just to summarize you blew eighty six hundred dollars in 2011 on a luxury phone you have since accumulated six more of them including a retail $25,000 pimp phone then we're gonna include a picture of that you got for hopefully a lot less than that you know it was a problem it was the shipping and the customs fees and like the all the this is a humanitarian crisis because that's seriously like I collected old blackberries you yeah going back to like remember the very first one which was like a wedge that was a pager yeah yeah yeah so I just wanted one of every generation of blackberry we heard but I didn't get blinged out ones like I just wanted like the regular one and I also collected hewlett packard calculators all of the

[00:13:13] HP's now I never got some of the originals because those were - out of my price range but and I thought that was weird but I gotta tell you this might well good weird well there's anything wrong with that here's the deal I've spent less than twelve thirteen thousand dollars total because of the auctions and the deals whatever and I've traded in some and then they once sent me a loaner and kept it they forgot they sent it to me the company of the business know so they won't come after me but actually so you think true good point so I actually have 80 something thousand dollars of cell phones that have actually only paid $13,000 for so no right you sound like me rationalizing the dumb I buy like I have X thousands of dollars worth of Y that I only paid Z for but like Z is still probably anyway I'm not gonna judge because I am the last guy that should be judging but I cannot wait to include a picture of that phone it's just hard to believe it exists it's like it was handmade and the signature is behind the battery the guy signed it in metal I can't believe we have been talking for six minutes and 55 seconds and we could talk for another hour just about this that's how many more questions I have to probe your psyche the Ferrari one that I have this is a good one - the Ferrari one actually they stuck a recorder underneath the Ferrari in 2010 to record the sound Ferrari accelerating and that Ferrari is the ringer the acceleration sound see that's one I could get into yeah that's and I might have to borrow that one's beautiful that's like super blind it's like got a red back you like you can see the red lights and the anyway I didn't know such a market existed well the company went this is needless to say it doesn't really exist oh and then there was the one less sorry I'm sorry then there was the one where I bosses your show you can literally talk about whatever you want this is a great one because I bought I got such a great deal online I couldn't figure it out and I get this phone I was so excited and it's all in Chinese so I was text my friends family just in Chinese just and they wouldn't know what I was saying I didn't know what I was saying that was a problem so when you say text just randomly type characters yes and I was hysterical people were like what are you talking about him conveying Chinese characters and I would reply in Chinese and that's a great phone it's on the shelf still but that was a nice phone very inexpensive god this is fantastic we might have to do a dedicated episode just on this the phone I'll bring them all and it's right down the block okay well on to the

[00:15:40] Monday I was reading through something because we've known each other for several years now but they're like a bunch of things you just don't know about a person until you realize oh you know I'm gonna sit down Richard and talk to them I want to learn at least like five things about him that like tell me a little bit about how he got to where he got and so I'm reading through this and the two things that I learned well now three given the self this bling phone thing but the two things that I learned about you were you had finished medical school before I had started medical school you finished med school at 23 the other thing I learned about you is you were a rip-roaring DJ DJ and recording producer mundane was DJ rush I had a recording studio in my basement growing up with my bar mitzvah money actually I took all the money and bought out this other guy this older guys old recording studio so I got like again it's all about value so I spent like 3 grand which is a lot back then huge amount of money but it was all of my bar mitzvah money all the presents and I got like 12 15 thousand dollars of recording equipment and magically I set up a recording studio and I actually put an ad in the Pennysaver I'm dating myself now I grew up in the in Suffolk County and Long Island and Commack and I put an ad in the Pennysaver and people in

[00:16:47] Queens were my best customers because people in Queens would usually go to the city and pay all this money for recording but then they would come out east to Suffolk County and that's how I made money in high school did that help you fund college or anything like that no I was a computer tutor I had like 400 bucks in cash from computer tutoring for college that I got to use I know I didn't you ended up spending that money you reinvested it you reinvested that recording in music equipment random weird guitars shape of the NJ warlock like this weird-looking guitar thing yes

[00:17:18] I like weird it's not weird man it's beautiful appreciate it embrace it when you went to med school did you know that you wanted to be a neurologist you sorta yeah if you don't think I'm a dork for collecting luxury vintage cellphones this is even more ridiculous but I was in summer camp in sixth seventh grade and it was teen travel and we would go to like I think we're on a trip to

[00:17:38] Tennessee actually and we're heading on down to Nashville and on the bus I brought I shouldn't giggle but neuroanatomy made easy and understandable it's like neuroanatomy for dummies exactly yes yep that's exactly what it was and this is I was in sixth seventh grade and my brother was a neurologist your brother's older he's older is 13 years old than me so he was finishing med school also at 23 he did a six year program also I was 10 so um I got his hand me down books he would leave them in the room and I would I guess read them so I think I was interested in the brain but I could never even though I had this book I would read this book a hundred times I have no conception of neuroanatomy I just like it just like way over my head even though I started studying it when I was 11 so you guys are from an underachieving family you also had an uncle I believe that was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease when you were quite young yes so my uncle was diagnosed when I was in high school and

[00:18:32] I always know is gonna be a neurologist I didn't know exactly which area which feel that I think the brain was interesting I also kind of chose neurology because it was the most challenging I wanted to be challenged for my career but honestly when I was in residency I guess I just felt a connection to older people I didn't exactly have grandparents I only had a grandfather who passed away when I was 8

[00:18:49] I didn't meet any of my other grandparents they passed away before I was born and I don't know I just felt a connection to older people so that was part of it I guess I could have seen myself too in Parkinson's disease I actually in some ways the plan was to go to like a as best of a residency as I could so I could then one day join my brother in practice live in Florida but I wasn't sure about Parkinson's I liked it I liked Alzheimer's also I liked cognitive neurology I'm actually trained in Beth

[00:19:13] Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston where cognitive neurology really was born it's the first place in the United States a picture of Norman Geschwind the conference room so a long story short I think cognitive neurology was always challenging and interesting but I didn't just want to do phenomenology like oh look at this aphasia or look at this whatever I wanted to treat patients and I think because I understood what it was like you know Alzheimer's terrible just like a terrible terrible horrible disease I want to get like you know emotional and upset but it's just terrible and was like my Uncle Bob introduced my parents so it's number one so that's why I'm here today and this is a completely true story I was 3 my uncle bob was in the

[00:19:53] Navy and I was at my aunt Carol's house also in Long Island and I jumped into the pool thank to the bottom and everyone was inside then my Uncle Bob ran out jumped in and saved me to this day I actually avoid water I hate swimming I hate I don't go in the ocean I don't go on baths I mean I stay away from water traumatized by that oh yeah oh yeah I can't even I don't want to go near a pool I don't go in pools I don't like the feeling of water my Uncle Bob obviously was a special guy but just to see like he was the life of the party that was like that relative where he had a saying what a party like at all the weddings and whatever so uh just to see someone like that become what he became and then just to see what the toll took on his daughter and sons just it was just a terrible horrible disease so I think I empathized with it I understood it and that's really where I chose to forge the career path I think it's so interesting how many people in medicine have a story about a moment that either a moment or an interaction or relationship that became so pointed in their decision to enter medicine I don't think that's absolutely necessary I mean

[00:21:00] I think many people enter medicine for sort of less specific or less tangible reasons but but I'm always amazed by these stories so I appreciate you sharing that let's fast-forward a little bit and talk about you finished residency in Boston and then did you come back to New York no so I actually left New York for longer than I was in

[00:21:18] New York I graduated at 17 I spent six years in Kansas City this is a 6-year medical program and so I finished early this is how the way most other countries do it in Europe and in Asia but actually the unique part about our program was medical school from day one so I'm 17 years old University of Missouri in

[00:21:34] Kansas City I have my lab coat and literally Tuesday and Thursday I was in the hospital and Monday Wednesday Friday I was in college and it was a very unique blended program and I couldn't ask for anything more I had literally six years of medical experience I was doing tons of Medicine I was doing electives throughout the country throughout the world I did a history of neurology tour throughout Europe for one of the elective months so I just got so much medicine exposure you usually medical students get two years of clinical medicine I had like six years intermittently of clinical medicine so I did that then I popped over to Miami for a year to do medicine training and then to Boston for three years and then I

[00:22:09] I headed back to Miami my mom was down there my family's down there so I had to back down there and I was in Miami for eight and a half years what was that how you met your fiancé yep you got it mammy and my band was playing she was in the front row where do you play at the base okay cuz you grew up playing the cello that I knew I did I grew up playing the cello until I got a fight with my orchestra teacher I told him to go F himself and that was the end of that he had this like complex the you know it was like I'm better than you because he was in a Maxwell House commercial he was the conductor in the

[00:22:39] Maxwell House commercial and like that's finical exactly he was the conductor the Maxwell House commercial so like you know he was his crap didn't stink so I just couldn't take it and I told him to eff you and I walked out and what how old were you I was probably in tenth grade yeah tenth grade so that I joined the band actually and is it easy to transition from cello to bass I didn't practice didn't take a lot I took two lessons that's right I took two lessons and I just kind of put the fingering is similar yeah the frets threw me actually the frets were hard so I actually got a fretless bass joined the band with some of my friends and then actually the guitarist and one of the bands I joined has been living on my couch for a year and a half it's a whole nother story but a lot of stories in your life yeah like keeping it simple you know exactly so played bass always been it's music that's when you're the bass playing neurologist hipster in Miami yep meet the blonde girl sitting in the club so yeah I was wearing my Mexican wrestling mask and shirtless yeah my band had this shtick we were called the regenerates music for the right brain and our logo was this brain but we had like this shtick where we played like anyway long story short but yes there's a video evidence of this oh we can links to all over Facebook very very generous we have 99 likes on Facebook and so

[00:23:54] Travis and Bob in preparing the follow up show notes for this will have a challenge trying to just focus on some of the Alzheimer's stuff we talked about and limiting the bling phones and banned photos and videos to 10% of the total volume of show notes so the phone is called the virtue constellation unless you taking a picture okay after we talked on Sheva radio

[00:24:17] I actually think we'll be left to be imaginary I had professional pictures taken of the phone because I dropped it like it took like a few years job didn't so no I can totally I'm sitting here laughing at you and look on my wall there's professional photos of watches I feel much better than you the BlackBerry collection I'm redeemed I don't even know who I am the judge so then what got you to New York I guess in life one needs to make a decision kind of where one goes and one what priorities one has Miami was amazing I had amazing opportunities um I wrote a book back in 2010 and then it came out like first week in 2011 called

[00:24:52] Alzheimer's treatment Alzheimer's prevention a patient and family guide and I put together in this book this plan about what I do for my patients I used to I was known in Miami for spending lot of time with patients and when patients would leave they would always have like ten things to do or 15 things to do and that was very unique because most people the neurologists are just saying it's called diagnose and adios and neurologists don't treat disease we admire it well not me

[00:25:16] I'm going to because of my family history because of whatever one thing leads to another and I want to do anything and everything as long as it's evidence-based and safe so I was known for jamming the printer in the neurology department because my recommendations was like sometimes 10 pages 15 pages and

[00:25:31] I put together nutrition little pamphlet and this and you know it got to the point where I was jamming the printer so much that I went to Kinko's I had a bound it was more expensive to bind it so I wrote this book and I would give the book to the patient it was like printed out like two dollars to print out the book so I would give the book to the patients and then magically the

[00:25:47] Today Show called one day needing an expert about like music and Alzheimer's disease which I talked about publicly next thing I know I'm selling hundreds of books online and put up a website on that kind of thing so why do I tell the story I tell a story not to sell books I don't care about selling books but when

[00:26:02] I wrote the book I got a lot of flack because in the title I wrote Alzheimer's treatment Alzheimer's prevention this plan what does this plan that you telling people to do show me the evidence you know there's fda-approved drugs that may work marginally but what does all this other stuff you're doing it's crap so you know I talked to the Alzheimer's

[00:26:18] Association on the phone and they said no you can't say this and I talked to the actually a colleague I shouldn't really say this but there's a colleague on the down the hall from me and my academic appointment I knew his wife did this I shouldn't be saying this again it's been but whatever his wife wrote a really negative scathing review about my book it was actually probably him writing the review and I said to myself but I really believe in this I'm not trying to sell books I don't give a crap about books I made the book large print and it's cost more money to print and I make less money per book and I don't care I want better quality pages that and I just I don't say someone questioned my integrity or whatever but I guess someone questions my integrity and I I'm not trying to sell something and believed in it and the only way to prove in a rigorous way that multimodal interventions work whether it's patient education lifestyle interventions pharmacologic management everything the only way to prove that that works the only way to do that is in a large academic Medical Center and I basically interviewed in New York and Boston I was about this close to go back to Boston and a great offer at Harvard would have been a major stepping stone in my career to be that age in that level to be an associate professor and you know director of an Alzheimer's clinic but they wouldn't let me use the term prevention so when I came to interview at Cornell and my chair said oh yeah

[00:27:32] Alzheimer's prevention that's probably gonna be something new sure and the Dean as she was signing my letter back in 2012 said no I gotta meet this guy so July 4th weekend 2012 I'm all like oh it's about to move to New York what's happening and I go meet her and I got a 15 minute meeting I had a seller on literally the only place in the country that I was I was allowed so I called around and whatever I wanted to start this Alzheimer's prevention thing and she interviewed me and she you know

[00:27:58] Breton and my CV it was like I think this was the Dean of Cornell Medical School's it was the end of the CEO exactly the Dean of the Medical School says no I'm not signing this guy's letter we're not starting an Alzheimer's prevention clinic that's crazy I have to meet him and I was given 15 minutes on my on her calendar to plead my case and the first question she had food you bring in a bling phone no but I was so prepared I had like a collated folder and I had a USB with all the evidence and I was ready to go and I walk in and she looks at me she looks down at my CV and she looks at me and she says how old are you she doesn't know you're Doogie Howser man she was expecting the traditional bearded bowtie older 50s whatever sixties neurologist type and I look like that so we talked about my age and my the training and the 23 things which by the way today is probably not even legal probably exactly and then in the last two minutes of her after talking about the age and how the CV got so long I basically said listen I'm serious this is my plan I'm not over promising Alzheimer starts in the brain decades before the first symptom people don't know that I don't even think she realized that when someone's diagnosed with dementia didn't start that day it started decades before I explained this to her the new criteria had just came out the new diagnostic criteria come out like that summer and she said ok I'll let you do this prevention thing and that's it the only place that I could have gone in the country possibly the world who knows to do what I have tried to do and what I've actually been able to accomplish in the last five and a half years is New York City it's just and Weill Cornell and York Presbyterian has been the same for New York

[00:29:36] Presbyterian is amazing things are happening here and I'm not trying to give a commercial but there's just no other place that I would have been able to do this so you mentioned the diagnostic criteria so let's start from the beginning because at least once a week I got a call from a friend or a patient saying I think my mom or my dad is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and I say well tell me why tell me a bit more and they're like well you know my mom's just having a harder time remembering things she's repeating herself or my dad is you know having a hard time fill in the blank right so how is the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease made and how does it differ from other types of dementia Alzheimer's disease has traditionally been a clinical diagnosis meaning you talk to a patient like you were doing you get a history of progressive short-term memory loss and when that memory loss and other cognitive changes and sometimes sleep trouble and behavior changes depression and agitation whatever so cognition sleep psychiatric comorbidities when all of these cognitive brain symptoms cause activities of daily living to be no longer able to be done by that person then that person has something called probable Alzheimer's disease dementia so in the past the clinical way was to talk to the patient progressive short term memory loss common things happen commonly it's probably going to be Alzheimer's disease is now it's about 60 70 percent of the time when people get older sometimes they forget things they lose their keys you have a word on the tip of your tongue but you remember that later you find your keys later that can be non pathological changes associated with age so there's something called age-related cognitive change or cognitive aging is even the more appropriate term cognitive aging is separate from Alzheimer's disease but it doesn't lead to a pathological diagnosis in the brain and it doesn't lead to alterations and activities of daily living people can still take care of themselves they can still pay bills and function independently so Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia but there's different forms of dementia also there's frontotemporal dementia which is more of a behavioral problem there's dementia with Lewy bodies and that's similar to Parkinson's disease symptoms along with dementia it was reported that after Robin Williams death that he had

[00:31:49] Lewy body dementia superimposed on whatever else people had speculated was going on is that true or that just a rumor oh no that's true I've heard his wife she was honored at the American Academy Neurology last year and she talked about this and he didn't treat him I don't diagnose can say only from a periphery but it seems from what I've heard some of the paranoia the hallucinations the slowed movements the vivid dreams acting out dreams it seemed pretty consistent and would those be different from a patient presenting with the more typical Alzheimer's disease in other words are those slightly more unique to Lewy body dementia yeah so you know by far all time which I'm told by the way can only be diagnosed in an autopsy yeah I mean I'm a clinical diagnostic so it's a new era it's a new world so when your friends or your patients call you and say does my mom have Alzheimer's disease you listen to the story neurologic diagnosis should be made based on the history eighty to ninety percent of the time so I still always defer to the clinical impression but in 2018 nineteen twenty net cetera it's just a different world we can do biomarkers so we can do scans and does the person have amyloid in the brain well that's Alzheimer's but then again people with Lewy body dementia also have amyloid so it's confusing but long story short when people have progressive short term memory loss and other have changes it's probably Alzheimer's until proven otherwise the key thing is that we want to rule out reversible causes so make sure they don't have thyroid trouble or b12 deficiency things like that pretty uncommon five percent of the time eight percent of the time whatever it is and a lot of times people have a thyroid problem or b12 deficiency you'll fix it and maybe the symptoms will get a little better but they may have Alzheimer's anyway so we want to rule out reversible causes we always have to do some brain imaging either a cat scan got a rule out a tumor or a MRI now the American Academy Neurology states you can do any brain imaging I'm in my clinical practice we always recommend an MRI and what phase of MRI just a regular MRI no contrast I just want to make who is that which image you looking at the t1 or t2 well I want to look at everything you know is their vascular burden could this be vascular cognitive impairment by itself could this be vascular and Alzheimer's was about 35% of the time you have

[00:33:58] Alzheimer's and vascular cognitive impairment so you just want to get a sense of what it looks like but but to me when I look at an MRI I look for atrophy shrinkage of the brain and if the frontal lobes which is the planning processing higher-order thinking part of the brain and the temporal lobes which is the memory center of the brain especially the part of the brain called the hippocampus hippocampus I think in

[00:34:17] Latin means seahorse basically looks like a little seahorse thing when it's cut and if there's a hole in the hippocampus you know where the big space of shrinkage even without the fancy biomarkers which we'll talk about progressive short-term memory loss and atrophy in the brain and certain Alzheimer's specific areas especially the hippocampus is Alzheimer's till proven otherwise now again it's a new era we can check for amyloid in the brain we can look for amyloid and tau in the spinal fluid you know even soon we'll be able to do tau scans tau protein is another like amyloid pathologic protein that gets built up and then brain of a person with

[00:34:52] Alzheimer's and and you can look at these biomarkers to make a definitive diagnosis does this person have Alzheimer's the only main reason to do that is if we're gonna think about a clinical trial because if you get into a clinical trial the only way to do that is to have Alzheimer's in the brain and in the past and we'll talk about why have so many Alzheimer's drugs failed why studies left-and-right failure failure failure there was one study that you know this is only like five or six years ago before the era of biome markers there was one study where 40% of the people with a clinical diagnosis of

[00:35:24] Alzheimer's disease in the study did not have amyloid in the brain but they were getting anti-amyloid treatments this was later found with a scan or on autopsies different studies have done it different ways so the take-home point here is that Alzheimer's is a little confusing you can make a clinical diagnosis but the clinical diagnosis isn't always correct so that's why we need to think about biomarkers in certain situations you talked a lot about short-term memory where do you see changes when do you see changes in other parameters of cognition such as executive function or processing speed so when I think about the brain I think about different areas and I don't say like pin the tail and donkey but it's like you know pin the tail on the part of the brain that's manifesting a change in cognition so you know memory there's short-term memory there's long-term memory being able to have a memory someone needs to be able to pay attention to something so at another area of the brain in terms of cognitive function is processing speed or attention and they're pretty similar then there's executive function which is higher order processing judgment planning things like that there's other things language is important learning is important if you can learn something how can you remember it so what we do is we try to really hone in on exactly what the cognitive domain or cognitive area is deficient so for example when you have someone call you and say memory is terrible well is it really memory that's what cognitive assessments do when my nephew was texting I can't say when I'm texting cuz my phone's from 2010 but when my nephew is texting it could check some Chinese though I got the other one the other one thats a great phone next podcast I'll bring that someone's texting and not paying attention and then I asked my nephew a question 20 minutes later it's not like they forgot they never never assimilated exactly it never encoded it it never got into the memory so so we always want to make sure is this an attentional thing because for example common things happen commonly dementia common but depression is also very common in a pseudo dementia of depression is very common so if someone says I can't remember but if there pressed whether it's a serotonin issue whether it's whatever and you do the testing they're not able to be attentive during the exam so they're not remembering if you treat the depression for example serotonin drugs or whatever else well then the attention gets boosted and then the memory comes back so it's not a dementia due to a neurodegenerative condition it's a pseudo dementia due to depression so there's a lot of things out there and that's why getting to the the root of the which area of the brain is truly not working is key short-term memory long-term memory processing speed attention that kind of thing I was about three or four years ago when I realized

[00:38:06] I wanted to start including cognitive testing in our assessments in our practice and so Dan pallets are who is one of our analysts at the time I said I tasked Dan with this problem I said Dan I want you to go out there and I want you to learn everything about cognitive testing so that we can get the best-in-class you know we're gonna do the best blood testing imagine what we're gonna do the best this the best is the best this the best cognitive testing well that turned out to be a fool's errand because he came back with I don't know 27 different tests that one could do some of these were clinical tests like the NIH had a tool kit with all of its tests within it but then there were a bunch of commercial tests you could do online and look at this stuff and I mean my take on the sort of commercially available ones because there was one problem that immediately became obvious to me which is it took a great deal of skill to administer a subset of these tests so immediately said we're not going to do those tests because like we don't have the skill to do it and we're not going to invest the time to do that because we don't have the patient of volume like we're not an Alzheimer's clinic right so we figured we have to use an off-the-shelf thing and I was like these all strike me as like kind of but I was like look here's the definitive assessment we're gonna do I and I had Dan maybe I shouldn't be saying this story online but that's probably legal if not let's bleep this part out please Bob I basically had Dan and a bunch of his buddies like get together one night at their place they're all over 21 by the way and take the test each of them took the test like it was like six guys I each took the test and then do a shot I provided the alcohol and then redo the test and then do a shot and then redo the test and then do a shot and I think they did this for six rounds and my question was if the test is truly a measure of cognitive capacity that cannot be learned their performance should deteriorate if you can learn the test then their performance should stay flat or even get a little bit better as they become inebriated and of course their performance was flat so like six hours later you know whatever they're eight drinks into this thing they're hammered they're doing just as well in the cognitive test at that point I was like okay we are not gonna solve this problem using over-the-counter commercial tests and that's when you know you and I already knew each other but that's when

[00:40:21] I was like all right Richard what is going on with this cognitive testing thing and then I came into the clinic I met you I met Holly I met the team and I was like oh yeah we're never doing this like we're gonna send our high-risk patients to you guys because this is way too much work it's really complicated oh this has been complicated for decades and you just tell a quick story I mean first of all our battery the cognitive test we do is we we do a little more than half on computer because you know we use the NIH toolbox we also use odor identification which is important and that's hard to have a practice effect on some tests are less practice effective all other other tests are common to expect that we use pen and paper tests so what we've done is we put together an hour and 20 30-minute battery that kind of is a greatest hits that tries to look at people that are you know in the normal slash very early phases of

[00:41:07] Alzheimer's that the problem is is that most of the cognitive tests out there have been scaled or used and validated and Ament for people with dementia so they're not sensitive to pick up people with early cognitive decline who don't have dementia exactly and the newer tests just don't have the robust validation in people who are normal versus normal no amyloid in the brain versus normal with amyloid in the brain and until we have thousands of people that do that any off-the-shelf or insert any some are better than others for sure we just don't have the perfect solution we this actually is a great time to talk about this but this past weekend we had the first ever Alzheimer's prevention clinic and brain health clinic symposium where all of us are there's six centers like this like ours now we were the first in 2000 where are the other five in 2014 the Alzheimer's risk assessment and early intervention program in

[00:41:53] University of Alabama Birmingham opened in 2014 very different model than us it's a to visit model sort of thing they get into Mariah and they did it's just a different way to do it great person down there David Gelber then actually we opened a satellite clinic in Puerto Rico the Alzheimer's prevention clinic and research center of

[00:42:10] Puerto Rico doing amazing everything was great and then in the her oh boy she didn't have power for six months she's picking up the pieces you know patients coming for prevention the patients need to come to like get electricity and get psychological counseling for the PTSD after the storm she's calling a PTSD and

[00:42:27] Pueblo I think that's what she calls it so that was a tough time but we're still running we have the brain health center at a North Shore Hospital in Chicago in Evanston Illinois Matthew French I'll be there next week oh cool yeah good good people over there they have a very heavily focused on electronic medical record to try to track these things newest Center is actually two ones in Boca Raton Florida at Florida Atlantic University in Boca

[00:42:50] Raton the dementia prevention initiative Jim Galvin is like if you think we do a deep dive Jim Galvin does the deepest dive I mean we're talking to like the magma of the earth he does from bone density to metabolomics and proteomics to EEG I mean if there's an outcome measure he does it but that's his expertise and he's super great at that and then the newest Center is opening at the Pacific gentleman Cancer Institute but it's Providence st. John's and it's called the Pacific brain health center in Santa Monica California really great people that were recruited from UCLA

[00:43:24] David Merrill is one of them and we're all for the first time trying to collaborate and trying to harmonize these measures because honestly I don't know what the right measures are we're trying to create an additional free cognitive assessment that can be done online but the toolbox can only be done on computer and iPad the versions that we built were actually on the phone so we built six versions of something called the face name associated memory test we worked with Doreen rents to help us with this she's amazing she validated this where if you do poorly on a face named associative memory that predicts amyloid in the brain so what we've done it then we then created all remember how predictive it was don't quote me on that kind of stuff but um it's pretty predictive it worked pretty well I don't remember from the paper but we created these tests and it was not the eh per say it was a different reputable organization because the words

[00:44:12] Alzheimer's and Prevention was in our name they didn't want to use our tools or really be associated with our programs so we've been getting Tomatoes thrown at us for quite some time and for example this symposium we had this weekend we had all these brain health centres we all get criticism and you know we all get criticism because for example we don't even know what are the right tools to use which are the best cognitive test which is this which is that so we've been getting criticism for a long time however thankfully the tide is turning and it's kind of a new day in a new era for example even the you know last year the Alzheimer's Association put out 10 tips for brain health to preserve cognitive health that's amazing this year at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago the amount of the word prevention that were used was I couldn't believe it prevention this prevention that now now you know that there's a big big big debate on you know Alzheimer's prevention or Alzheimer's risk reduction which is the most accurate term we just got our foundational methods paper accepted in the paper as we titled it was the clinical practice of Alzheimer's prevention a precision medicine approach went through the review process now this is the journal Alzheimer's and dementia the Journal of the Alzheimer's

[00:45:20] Association it's a number one journal of all Alzheimer's journals it's the number four ranked clinical journal in neurology ok great it's impact factor 12.75 whatever it is this is the first time they've ever published anything from us so that's good news but one of the six reviewers said no you can't use prevention the title you have to change it to risk reduction that then led us to write another paper which I hopefully will be submitting soon called

[00:45:46] Alzheimer's prevention versus Alzheimer's risk reduction transcending semantics for clinical practice because there's a big difference in my mind about prevention versus risk reduction there's also implications because when you say prevention the patient sitting in front of you gets that when you say risk reduction what kind of message is that to the public it's confusing so there's this whole semantic argument we went through this with our paper I had a different experience several years ago that has given me an a window into understanding where this resistance comes from so it was probably four years ago and I was asked to give a Grand

[00:46:19] Rounds and got breast cancer but specifically to discuss the use of metformin in the risk reduction of breast cancer and so I gave this long talk about you know all of these topics and one of the implications of my talk was that if metformin could be effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer the question then became could dietary choices also impact breast cancer and so one of the questions was posed if a woman has breast cancer is she better off eating ice cream or not eating ice cream and I said look all things equal my intuition is she's better off not eating ice cream given that most breast cancers are quite insulin sensitive they're very sensitive to IGF and other growth factors this one person in the room who was very senior quite an opinionated individual who I'm not overly fond of basically lept up and down and said you know this is complete the moment you start suggesting and I had to ask like 12 questions to get at the lair of the hostility but it became very clearly what the hostility stem from which was an understandable opposition it was if you started talking about breast cancer prevention if you start suggesting that a person with breast cancer can change the way they eat to reduce their risk of death from this disease you are implying that the patient brought this disease on themselves now again I think that's an error I think there's a logical fallacy there but I believe that that logic exists in Alzheimer's disease as well I think that when when we talk about

[00:47:45] Alzheimer's prevention somehow it is being turned into well then you're saying patients are bringing this on themselves it's their fault there could be something done to prevent this therefore you know and we don't like that message so that's what my intuition tells me is this opposition and unfortunately I think that type of third grade JV poor understanding of logic and risk is basically slowing down progress in this space immensely as evidenced by the fact that you can't get a grant I mean this was true a year ago you can tell me today things are much better now you could not get a grant to study

[00:48:20] Alzheimer's prevention if you had the word prevention in the grant title zero we have three NIH grants no actually I just got a like a fourth little part so we have like 3.1 NIH grants I mean that's not any of these RO ones yeah one we have one part of a program project one ro one we're looking at the program project looks at women between the ages of 40 to 65 well very early on soon well well they're very menopausal yeah well not actually it's funny you say 40s early I say we need to start at 30 but no 40 to 65 I think it's a good sweet spot and we're looking at women between the ages of 40 to 65 that's the program project that we just got Lisa Moscone as 2p eye on the men's brain imaging so we're looking at menopause transition as the window of opportunity like when do we need to intervene and how and then the ro1 we got was the men's brain imaging study which is basically the male menopause transition which is andropause so we're looking at it's a small small number only 15 men a year for four years but it's better than nothing between 40 and 65 we then just got an administrative supplement to now image women not just a baseline but also at 18 months so we just got that today actually and then I mean that's pretty pretty good ya know that's a huge improvement and so much of what you just said now makes me want to take a step forward so let's start with the following how do you define in your clinic what a high-risk patient means what is the definition of a high-risk patient anyone with a brain is at risk for

[00:49:46] Alzheimer's disease well let's take a step further back than that what is the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States today no one knows you'll see 5.1 million Americans 5.3 million Americans 5.7 million Americans this is all estimations based on like one county in Illinois from like years ago and then it's been extrapolated and posted all over so why don't we have those data the way we do for cancer for example

[00:50:09] Alzheimer's is confusing I mean there's Alzheimer's dementia and probably around four or five million people have it but the best numbers were recently published most updated was that 47 million Americans have preclinical Alzheimer's disease meaning Alzheimer's in the brain but no symptoms sorry meaning based on something you would see on an imaging study or a lumbar puncture or because those would be basically the only two ways you could see something in the brain today 47 million people would have that finding that also must be an estimate but do not yet have cognitive impairment yep so five ish million people have dementia due to Alzheimer's 47 million Americans have Alzheimer's in their brain but no symptoms yet there's people before that with no Alzheimer's in the brain and no symptoms and we don't know if they're gonna get it yet and then there's a kind of gray area in between called mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and we don't exactly have the best numbers on that but it's somewhere between the transition phase between preclinical pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's and dementia due to Alzheimer's it's stage one stage two and stage three when I talk to my patients about death which if you're trying to practice longevity you have to be able to talk about death I share with them the obvious which is once you reached about the age of 40 assuming you're not a smoker your probability of dying from cerebral vascular disease cardiovascular disease cancer or

[00:51:34] Alzheimer's disease is north of 75% and almost without exception that in within that constellation of disease is the one that people fear most is Alzheimer's disease but it a very few patients actually understand what it means to die from Alzheimer's disease and this becomes a bit challenging when one starts to look at death certificates and maybe this is part of the problem in coming up with an accurate estimate of that how do people actually die when they have Alzheimer's dementia so

[00:52:04] Alzheimer's disease is a indirect cause of death you know for example when someone gets a urinary tract infection that urinary tract infection may be treated by antibiotics because the patient will say oh it hurts and going more frequently test my urine and give me an antibiotic but when someone has Alzheimer's dementia they're not able to convey this and that UTI becomes pyelonephritis which becomes sepsis which can kill them very exactly so some people will put Alzheimer's on their death certificate now some will say urosepsis yeah so there's never gonna be great numbers Alzheimer's is the impetus to death in most patients for sure they can't report their pain close call him a friend but he's a patient in the clinic also good guy

[00:52:51] I've seen his mom and his mom was just diagnosed with cancer and she was complaining of abdominal pain something nonspecific she saw a doctor dr. Chateau who's got dementia has got some belly pain you probably constipated here take some constipation meds didn't get better didn't get better than get better turns out she may have pancreatic cancer and she had a gallbladder something and now had to put a stent in right only when she turned yellow did they figure out what the cancer was so Alzheimer's disease dementia causes a person not be able to express themselves and not be able to care for themselves in certain ways and the caregiving has to happen for them and so you see a lot of these aspiration pneumonia is you see you know my closest friend one of my closest friends my roommate in medical school I just went back to his father's funeral two weeks ago his father just passed away he had Alzheimer's disease but it was very sudden onset and within the course of eight months his health deteriorated so quickly and ultimately he died from cellulitis obviously but you can see that this is someone who probably at the very end was at risk for these things because of all these other changes so and I've also seen people die from just failure to thrive they have

[00:54:03] Alzheimer's disease and they just can't eat it they don't want to eat they completely lose their appetite they become anorexic and they be sort of almost drift into a vegetative state where unless you would force-feed them they will die relatively quickly but this also strikes me as part of the challenge of trying to get a handle on a disease that has such a ubiquitous face at the end in Alzheimer's disease the life course disease at every moment someone is either potentially having silent pathology building up Alzheimer's is a life course disease and each phase of life Alzheimer's is a confusing difficult disease to manage you know end-of-life it's more obvious but towards even the beginning of life you know people that are born with the eight

[00:54:46] Bowie Ford gene for example is the most talked about a law commonly research gene I'm start off with a smaller brain so you think of Alzheimer's disease the way I think of cardiovascular disease which is this disease begins at Birth everybody's on a different plane based on a number of hereditary or acquired risk factors your path is not set on that slide you get to determine it but your track might be a bit set yeah you know you asked me before what's your high-risk patient what does that look like and I

[00:55:14] I mean to be glib I meant I just was honest if someone has a brain they're at risk for Alzheimer's okay well everyone has a brain so go deeper not not everyone technically I have some counter of fact I'm not talking politics not going there I wasn't even gonna yet go there excellent so moving right along at every point in the life course a person's risk may change so early life midlife and late life there's different risk factors for Alzheimer's and you know I agree with you that some people can do everything right and still get

[00:55:46] Alzheimer's however based on population attributable risk models being conservative one out of every three cases of Alzheimer's disease may be preventable if that person does everything right now the other two out of three cases well hmm may not be preventable maybe we can delay it could we delay it by two years three years five years six years I have some hot off the press data

[00:56:10] I sent you right before I arrived to send you some new results so we're trying to hone in on the can we delay it and for how long but honestly other people will do everything right and absolutely still get Alzheimer's disease in and I think I understand why now because there's a tug of war going on 100% of the time and it's a tug of war between you and your genes environment and genes and when it comes to Alzheimer's the mnemonic I uses aged a GE a stands for age because age is the number one risk factor for

[00:56:41] Alzheimer's G is genetics and E is environment so epigenetics your interaction between the environment and your genome is going to put you on the path or try to knock you off of the path towards Alzheimer's and some people can do everything right but because of their 8bo we for gene plus another gene or because of their X gene or because of their whatever they're going to get

[00:57:01] Alzheimer's disease other people can modify their environment modify the impact of that gene on their outcomes and I believe that it's very reasonable to expect that one out of three cases of Alzheimer's can be prevented because if you can delay Alzheimer's by two five or seven or ten years by doing everything right in that subset they're going to probably die from something else yeah another thing that I always talk about in the prevention space I mean we as you know I take such a hardliner on cardiovascular disease because it is the leading cause of death and I believe of the major pillars atherosclerosis ease cancer and neurodegenerative disease it's the most preventable we understand the pathology of that disease so much better than the other two and we have more tools that seem to have efficacy at preventing that if nothing else I say it's at its optionality time as optionality and so similarly if you take somebody who for whom maybe it is a fait accompli that they are going to get Alzheimer's disease but you say you know what instead of getting it at 69 we can make it 78 well a lot can happen in nine years it's not just that you could die of something else which is maybe better maybe not depending on what that something else is but more importantly maybe you and your peers have nine extra years to come up with something else let's talk about a bowi because everybody you know I was actually doing and asked me anything yesterday mode this is the AMAs and there was a great question about a pony for and I just punted it because I knew you and I were talking today so I was like I love the speed round when I can say next a pony is a gene it exists mostly in three types though I'd been told there were actually a couple of others but for the large part there's an AoE two and apoE three and an ape oe4 you get one from mom and one from dad and that way everyone either has a 2 3 or a 3 3 or a 3 4 or 4 4 or 6 combinations the approximate prevalence the three threes represent probably what about 55 60 percent yeah you got a neutral risk so we call that unity risk right those are the single risk the two twos are very rare I've actually never seen a two -

[00:59:11] I've seen one okay they're reported at less than 1% of the population - I think I've seen two and they come with a risk reduction I believe of about 20% at the far end of the spectrum you have the four for now that used to be reported as 1% of the population but I see that so often that I think that's closer to three or four percent of the population you know in our 600 person cohort we have 37 but you're selecting for high-risk yeah I don't select for high-risk but I still feel like it's about four in our code it's like six now this is interesting the very first time I started paying attention to a PO II gene which was about 2011-2012 the literature said the four for patience relative to the three three patients have a twenty five fold increase I today we see that number I think continually being downward revised so for my four four patients the good news that I have three patients in my practice who are four four the good news for those patients is look these numbers are getting better and better I mean you and I I think offline would agree unofficially it might be closer to four to six x i don't even that you even even know optimistic well i'm just gonna be frank alzheimer's and eight bowie is confusing and having two copies of before does absolutely not mean you're gonna get the disease and it's a polygenic risk when it comes to the disease you know you can have two copies of you four but never have a family member and never get the disease

[01:00:34] I don't believe it's medically correct you know it's artists you know split hairs or whatever I don't even think you can say it's two percent or five percent or 20 percent or whatever percent higher how many fold whatever because you can't know until you know what the other person's genes are yeah it's very hard to do and I think the best that people are doing in these large population-based studies is saying acknowledging the heterogeneity of those other risk factors all things equal the last you know paper I read basically said eight to ten X so again maybe that's still an over estimate I believe it is an over estimate and I think it's certainly an over estimate with all the interventions we're gonna talk about but the point here is that's a heck of a lot better than its twenty to twenty-five fold risk then you have the three fours now they represent quite a bit of people that's like twenty to twenty-five percent of population cell 25 in our cohort it's about forty ok which again makes sense you're over representing again they used to be represented as about a three to four X I mean I think today we're saying maybe a 2 X again not with thinning your cap yeah so polygenic risk that you know we'll talk about precision medicine and kind of why what the future of Alzheimer's disease is and

[01:01:44] I actually think the future of Alzheimer's disease prevention is now I don't even think it's the future anymore I think the future is artificial intelligence but we can talk about that some other time the person that walks in with an e3 e4 I am actually more optimistic when they come in and less freaked out about the four because at least I know what I'm up against okay if that person's you have so many three fours in your cohort now easy easy

[01:02:11] I know lifestyle interventions work I am confident that when I do XYZ ABC the 27 things that I'll tell them to do based on precision medicine based on their metabolic risk factors their cholesterol their individual risks I can predict that they will have a response of this and this is satisfying to me the problem is is when someone comes in with a three-three I'm like oh meaning for a three-three to show up in your clinic by definition there's a reason either their family member had premature Alzheimer's disease and/or they're potentially even showing early signs of cognitive impairment that are subtle or no no I mean you know we were a prevention clinic so to get into our clinic you have to have normal cognitive function with a family history of Alzheimer's so so we focus on the normals now a33 could mean you did not get the four from mom or dad and life is beautiful maybe the risk is lower but if you have a three three and mom and dad were three three and they didn't have the four guess what they probably have another gene and I don't know what that gene is and I don't know what I'm up because you test the parents in that situation well it's tricky and now a lot of I would say when

[01:03:22] I first started the program most of our prevention patients so I'd say 60% of our prevention patients came from the patient with dementia I was treating her then saw their kids and their cousins and whatever else so and you know there's families I see with five six seven members and that's like the best to see because you can really understand the genotype and phenotype s-- and see the pattern I do the same thing with LP little a actually in the cardiovascular front which is very helpful right it's to be able to say let's track where this disease is coming from and see how much of it we can attribute to the genetic influence so so if a patient comes in and they're three three and mom got

[01:03:58] Alzheimer's disease at 57 and you know that mom is three four you feel a heck of a lot better than if mom is three three totally absolutely and you know we're trying to simplify things any of theirs with polygenic risk there's dozens of alzheimer's genes and the goal is is to now it's hard because we don't have a newer geneticist and as mentioned Holly before a nurse practitioner and myself we don't have the team it would take to spend hours and hours and hours and days to decode someone's genome but in the future hopefully we'll be able to do this in an automated way but the goal is is to understand okay if they have a four we're gonna do a B and C if they don't have a four we're gonna do XY and

[01:04:36] Z I want to come to the study that allowed you to talk about that before we go there we'll round this out you have two threes and two fours two fours are pretty rare about neutral risk my cousin's at two four I've seen two cases but it's pretty rare do we think that the two fours are at increased risk decreased risk because of the to increase risk because of the for all things equal similar ish two three three but a little worse yeah that's sort of my thinking and then the two threes get a benefit not as much as the two twos looks like it's about 11 10 to 15% yeah

[01:05:08] I really like two threes two threes I can really sink my teeth into and but you must not see many of these people no no I see two threes all the time why they still have risk they're still coming to you because of family history oh yeah but there's a different gene there's a different gene and that lurking in there but then we don't know what it is yet yep but there polygenic risk is lower because they don't have a for to amplify the gene the whole family where they came in and they said oh no we have early onset

[01:05:31] Alzheimer's in the family and I said no you don't didn't sound like it and we did all the stuff and mom Hedi for for uncle 84 for well that's pretty weird but okay grandparents for I'm sure they had four for them but there must have been a lot of fours going on and then when we look at the kids they have a three for well we do the three four but wait why do they get early disease what's going on and we found another gene a tnf-alpha gene yes so when you take tnf-alpha and you add to a four well you're gonna have a six-fold risk that's polygenic risk that's why they had early I was a teen if alpha gene does what's the phenotype when they have this well you have an inflammatory cascade it's a pro-inflammatory sure so that's like fast-forwarding to

[01:06:12] Alzheimer's now when you have a four-four and the TNF alpha that's when you start getting symptoms in your late 40s or 50s it's not early onset what's these gene that is almost a gerund priests in Dillon one priests Anil into an amyloid precursor protein gene mutation these are three genes that cause true early onset Alzheimer's meaning you have the gene and you get the disease in your 40s or 50s this is one of the only deterministic genes for

[01:06:36] AD correct it's exceedingly rare less than 1% as an example I have a 27 year old woman great gal she has a pre Ceylon one gene well how old was she when her mom or dad was diagnosed well her mom's in her early 50s and acting weird no and kind of in denial our family members range from 50s early 60s at the time that they were diagnosed yep but then you take a deep dive into pretty soon Ellen won and she actually has a good one from Belgium where they actually have later early onset meaning like 60s 6-0 and she's the first person

[01:07:07] I'd ever seen the prevention clinic who had an early onset gene and I could not say that she was gonna get Alzheimer's I said no I don't know that you will I think we can do something we have so much time in the next 20 years for you I'm not even like worried sure we'll take care of this so even and this is super controversial but I don't even think one person can say even having an

[01:07:29] Alzheimer's gene where you're gonna get the disease means you're gonna get the disease because the field has changes the field of genetics considering that a deterministic gene yes they do there's only about 75 to 100 gene so there's 20 them just for the listener there's about 20,000 genes in the human genome directionally only 100 are deterministic polygenic single gene leads to problems so you have the mutation for cystic fibrosis you are getting cystic fibrosis you have the gene for this glycogen storage disease you are getting it virtually every disease that we think of commonly of course does not have a deterministic genome certain cancers do but very few virtually all cancers of course are somatic mutations and not acquired term line mutations that's a ballsy thing to say right you're saying look 1% of Alzheimer's comes from a deterministic gene I'm not even convinced that's deterministic it might be an artifact of our G wasps well no no no it's this meaning our G wasps is basically never tried in intervention correct since it's a late well it's it's early means 40s and 50s but since we have now thirty and forty years to figure it out especially in her case who's twenty seven and if she doesn't get symptoms for 25 years I'm loading her up with curcumin I mean I got X Y & Z we're gonna be putting her in whatever amyloid drug that comes out in the next five to seven years I mean I cannot say that she is gonna get it so deterministic genes from birth well that's a different story you know cystic fibrosis terrible disease you get it and you have it early onset Alzheimer's genes uh it's a pretty you know well that's my point yeah I think that when i say artifact of gee was-- I mean the g was-- is only so genome-wide Association studies which for the listener is how we link genes to diseases it's basically epidemiology of genes if you study something where a potential treatment for a disease that could have played a role was never introduced you can actually be misled nicely yeah so the other thing I tell my patients so correct me if I have this right or wrong is that about two-thirds of patients in the u.s. who present with Alzheimer's disease have at least one copy of efore and about one-third of patients do not have a copy of e for it is that directionally about right that's probably pretty close I've always said 6040 I so that's right but I don't know its latest it depends on populations and so the point you want to make is look about a quarter of the population has an e for gene one or two copies and that quarter of the population makes up two-thirds to sixty percent of the disease so for my patients who have efore I say the good news is this doesn't mean that your efore means you're gonna get the disease to my III and II to patients who are busy high-fiving at this point I say by the way the bad news is not having e4 doesn't mean you are not susceptible to this disease so you still need to pay attention I think that individual risk needs to be calculated individually I said before o33 I'm worried well you know I don't want people who are listening to say oh wait I'm I thought three three was good yes for the grand vast majority people three three is good but I need to know what your other genes are and I take a stupid amount of time doing this through looking at their snips and this is you know research clinical complicated takes eight hours of Holly's time four hours of my time and then a whole lot of like cerebral is looking at Tom forty

[01:10:55] Tom forty has we don't have a commercial test that we can test for it there is a way to do it if we send it somewhere but we really never went there we pull it out of prometheus do you guys do that I may be getting this wrong but I don't think all it depends on where the genetic test was done and you won't be able to do this out of 23andme anymore unfortunately lift through Prometheus yeah you can no longer take 23andme data into Prometheus and get this degree of fidelity anymore which thanks FDA if you're listening ways so my understanding of was that the 23andme no longer has an API or like a way to transmit the data but you can still download the data from 23andme and then re-upload it to Prometheus still get the same report okay if that's true that makes me feel better will confirm that I hope that's the case yeah we've only done this once for citizen scientists out there I talked to your doctor and don't do this at home but one back of the napkin way to Google your genome is to do 23andme download the data file upload it to a service like Prometheus and then basically a filter filtering yeah I mean we've been working with you and we've come up with basically the snips for everything that we see in the literature that is a high risk and then we run like kind of an ad panel you know it's interesting we only do this for patients who are efore I guess we should be doing this for every patient family history of AD yeah yeah yeah exactly that's a good point but it's interesting you know it speaks to another controversy that we won't get into which is like information you know

[01:12:18] I mean I've been scolded by physicians for measuring apoe4 and telling a patient that they have a Nate Bowie for I won't go into that so what is it about a Polly for that's so special why is it getting all this attention I mean aside from the epidemiology which we've just discussed what is it doing or not doing that is increasing risk so eight Bowie plus age higher likelihood of amyloid then you add in gender women plus a po e plus 65 and over much higher likelihood of amyloid so again it's a poly not just a polygenic but a poly risk whatever it increases the likelihood of amyloid deposition so you just brought up something interest which was the question of females I've always found it hard to believe that the increased risk women see is explained only by their age meaning their survival advantage over men do you I mean this I think I know what my answer is but I'm I don't know what's the term I'm gonna lead the witness what is your view for why you think women are at a higher risk than men all things equal well you know you can take different roads to

[01:13:22] Alzheimer's disease diabetes will put you in the fast lane and this one that women are definitely in the express lane and why are they in expressly and I think it has something to do with ensure there's you know something about life course and you know having lots of children versus less children that can impact the two and there's a whole variety of thinking and more stress you know whatever does your study you want to read to attribute this but my feeling is the perimenopause transition has bioenergetic impacts on the brain and you know I believe that Alzheimer's disease is a mitochondrial based disease might the mitochondria the battery of the cell the mitochondria can cause all sorts of bad diseases from Parkinson's so ALS - whatever

[01:14:05] Huntington's I possibly actually that that's something separate so long story short people think of Alzheimer's as amyloid and tau I think amyloid is the garbage that accumulates and if you don't take the garbage out you you're going to get sick but the upstream effect is mitochondrial dysfunction and there's something about the mitochondrial bioenergetic pathways I'll just talk in generalities because I'm not an expert at this but I think there's something about the perimenopause transition the bioenergetic shifts in the brain that are fast forwarding a woman to

[01:14:37] Alzheimer's disease so I think it's hormonal how do we intervening you believe that it's the withdrawal of sex hormones that is accelerating the process of either mitochondrial decline or something that is leading to the accumulation of waste product being manifested as amyloid and tau yeah it's brain aging accelerator due to the menopause transition and that's why I think that the where we're going with our research and we have a whole sub research program to look at this is what is the critical window of opportunity to intervene now how do we intervene and when are the key questions you intervene before menopause perimenopause when do you intervene what do you do what progesterone estrogen should you use a pill or a cream or a patch to use it for two years five years seven years do you have to balance the decision based on breast cancer and other things get blood clots and smoking so I go by my gut in almost all things medical and can say that my understanding of this is kind of like if

[01:15:38] I had to use a television analogy maybe we're at the black-and-white television but at least we can see a picture we're not at color and we're not at hi-def but I think that my understanding is evolving and I think it has to do with brain bio energetic pathways and an individual woman's risk versus event now that's interesting because you also brought up Alzheimer's disease has been referred to as type 3 diabetes or brain diabetes which of course is also an energetics pathway so that would suggest that there seemed to be at least two maybe three or more completely distinct which does not say there's no overlap between these but paths towards the disease because the other one we didn't even talk about was a vascular path 2 or 3 I think there's like yeah you 12 or CA yeah I mean I talk because I'm sort of a simpleton on this topic I generally refer to it as three or four different paths to the same place where you have the same final common pathway everybody's accumulating amyloid beta and tau but you can get there through micro vascular disease which then becomes basically eye disease of hypoxia you can get there through diabetes which then becomes an energetic problem you can get there as you describe through a separate sort of mitochondrial dysfunction I mean you could think of a dozen things that could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction among them the one you described which to me strikes me as the Occam's razor explanation for why women would disproportionately have this difference from men is this great paper about this by Sheltie anitya I've read it great you know there was an interesting paper Richard about three years ago it was a very small paper I don't even remember how many women were in it but I remember it was surprisingly small and it was if I recall also heterogeneous in a pony type and it asked the question if took these women who were either perimenopausal or early menopausal and you treated them with HRT did you improve cognitive performance if I believe the result of that study was you did only in the woman that had an e4 gene but not on the woman that did not to which my interpretation was maybe you were just underpowered to detect a difference in the Nani force but because the ephors come with another risk you didn't need that many women to see the benefit so is it your practice today in the clinic to use hormone replacement therapy in perimenopausal women yeah this is a tricky one you know I've I know what I know and I know what I don't know and I have a very specific scope of practice I've never prescribe statins

[01:18:01] I've never I don't treat cholesterol per se although actually thanks to you and others I've learned a lot about plant sterols versus zetia and you know I'll make tacit suggestions and I'll use Omega the reason that kind of thing with cholesterol same thing with hormones I would never prescribe you have physicians that you that are willing to work alongside you in these areas I mean

[01:18:21] I have preventative cardiologists that we see eye to eye I have primary care doctors that I can see eye-to-eye with I have one reproductive endocrinologist in Texas who we see eye to eye and we speak the same language I don't really have an endocrinologist or a hormone doctor that I can refer patients to where we can have cogent conversations because I think the area is just so hazy the level of evidence is so hazy and I'll just tell you my you said eight but we for may have something to do with I also think metabolic status has something to do with this Roberta Brinton has looked at you know women with vascular risk so high cholesterol diabetes you know high blood sugar whatever that may be those patients are the one that respond preferentially to hormone replacement therapy but there's a lot of precision medicine in here that is very hazy that being said my kind of off-the-shelf answer would be women early on in the perimenopause transition for the first two five maybe seven years hormone replacement may be a good idea I just and probably is a good idea but I just don't know if you need to take a pill which pill what ratio of what to what and is a cream probably better

[01:19:27] I'm a geared towards the latter but I actually just don't know they're just study without what pregnant alone which i think is going to be very interesting so I I just I have strong feelings about this so we're gonna go have dinner after this we're gonna talk for probably two hours just about this topic this is a huge passion of mine and I know what's happening right now someone's listening to this and they're going wait just tell us the end and the end no I don't want to get into I don't want to jump on my soapbox about this because I want to come back to talking about this so you alluded to one of the most interesting things in your clinic now I don't know are we is the manuscript submitted so that I'm talking about the matrix of

[01:20:04] MTHFR by a Bowie biomarker versus cognitive thing that is that submitted yet published we literally have so just give me a brief snapshot so we started the Alzheimer's prevention clinic in 2013 took about a year and a half just under two years to get the IRB approvals and get all of our ducks in a row with getting the cognitive assessments the

[01:20:22] IRB approved and whatever so since March of 2015 unless three and a half years in change we've been recruiting patients into a registry where we basically follow patients across primary prevention secondary prevention and tertiary prevention of Alzheimer's disease dementia and I can define those in a minute so when we have this data we are deep deep deep in the data analysis phase and we literally have no Jo mmm over a thousand pages of results data tables graphs and I've only scratched the surface so let's explain the intervention taking a step back you're saying look we're gonna stratify patients by four things one genetics and the genes you looked at were apoE and

[01:21:05] MTHFR can you say a little bit about MTHFR for the listener MTHFR is confusing when I started the program I thought MTHFR was a whole bunch of whatever and now I don't believe that anymore MTHFR as methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase gene something like that MTHFR if you have multiple mutations how many patients have come to me and said on their tests when they look at MTHFR they're like why does it say

[01:21:28] I'm like no actually it's methyl tetra exactly so it's quite an interesting gene you can google and find all sorts of stuff out there but MTHFR does have a role in Alzheimer's risk but to me it is you know he can take different roads to Alzheimer's it's one of those roads just a metabolic road through homocysteine I mean is that what your hypothesis is exactly and I'm basically methylation detoxification you know whatever word you want to use that

[01:21:55] I don't love using these words because I just it's just very hazy but if you have multiple mutations to mutations in one of your main MTHFR genes two six seven seven gene you know and this is the back of the napkin but I'm not sure if this is technically correct but just for listeners the person may have problems or be inefficient and metabolizing b-vitamins and because of that they're in the downstream cascade of biochemistry homocysteine goes up and it's a marker for something not working efficiently and well in detoxifying whatever were you want to say when it comes to MTHFR homocysteine in people with Alzheimer's risk and precision medicine where if someone has an elevated homocysteine but they're treated with B vitamins they can slow overall brain atrophy and improve memory however that will only work if you have optimized omega-3 fatty acids so this precision component of understanding the person's individual biology is necessary because if you don't have high homocysteine you probably don't need this stuff you probably don't need B complex vitamins so in this case MTHFR is helpful in terms of looking at the gene because if someone is taking the regular B vitamins if you look on a b12 it's a cyano kovala mean if you look at folic acid it says folic acid we're giving the person extra folic acid in cyano Cabala me and we're giving them the B vitamins but they're homeless istening is not coming down they may need a more metabolically active form there's different race mik mixtures and there's different biochemical blah-blah-blah that we can talk about in different forms and different companies that make it actually the company that i use for my practice you told me about because literally reliably I send that little bottle and the yellow bottles works it always works it absolutely always works so in and you can do the prescription version and that actually probably always works too it's just a little more expensive but it definitely always works so I'm going around the block to get across the street because this is complicated but when a person is not responding to traditional B vitamins I will then step it up and give them methyl cobalamin b12 and methyl phobic whatever foley folic acid methyl touch or hydra foley whatever version of folic acid in the combination that is usually enough to get the homeless esteem down so this is a nice example of precision medicine and pharmacogenomics in our Alzheimer's prevention practice and I think the table or the the image that you're referring to is when we basically take all of our patients and we map different people with different genes do they respond to different things that's right it's every the x-axis would be at the top of the table would be each of the a PO e combinations so here's all six of them and then each of the MTHFR combinations there's two genes for combos per gene so eight of those and then it's basically in response to the lifestyle intervention program where did we see an improvement along which biomarkers and/or which element of cognitive testing but I guess just to be clear we're not gonna be able to show that table here that's not yet published right oh no no I mean that's on page 700 to 900 yeah so you know the first paper that we got except I've show that to patients all the time but I'm at a posters great yeah that's supposed to represented last year but you have to put the cart before the horse or whatever that's saying is but first you have to get the methods paper published and this is pretty amazing that we got this published in the Alzheimer's and dementia journal

[01:25:10] Journal the Alzheimer's Association and this is currently available just recently published yeah well link to anything and everything that you you let us my primary care doctor who you gotta meet in Miami this guy dr. Wolfe you guys are like two peas in a pod he basically said oh this is your manifesto like that's not my manifesto it just you know whatever but he called the de manifesto it's eleven thousand words of everything you need to know about how to manage a patient for Alzheimer's prevention and we've created a free will be accepted in one journal article it's three thousand words and thirty-five hundred words and the main thing and then we have all the rest in the entities yep and I can't believe it but it was all accepted and it was took seven months but basically we've actually since this is hard to read an eleven thousand word article we've actually created a free online CME course for physicians basically using this will that be ready by November yes so ails you org you also will make sure we absolutely link to that is there value in there for patients as well so ails you org is a free site that is for the public so for the lay public if you want to learn everything but well about what is and what is not in our control about Alzheimer's disease ails you dot org is a completely free site to learn about everything then there's the healthcare provider page if you go to the little healthcare provider tab and you type in your information you can then enroll in the health care provider course and actually receive CME credit for it so there's actually a valuable

[01:26:26] CME course out there like are they not the most useless idiotic things on the face of the earth okay not the way I mean once all you find a gem like this hey-ya and every time I do a CME course on nutrition I like I have to deliberately answer the questions incorrectly to pass the test right yeah it's CME's one of those things we've tried to really use cm eat are effective no one knows about this stuff dr. dr. is just done well that's great you know we're trying to get the word out we got the methods paper out that's done explaining the internet let's explain it sort of at a high level the intervention is a lifestyle intervention that is multimodal patients are stratified as I said by genetics so you have an MTHFR apoE you also have a anthropometric we try to keep it simple so the ABCs of Alzheimer's prevention management it sounds kitschy but I really think

[01:27:12] ABCs actually fits so a is anthropometric we look at body fat we look at lean mass we look at is visceral fat where is the fat you know I learned a lot of this stuff we really took a deep dive it's not just about weight and BMI like that's just like the worst no it's about body fat where's the fat metabolically active yada yada then the

[01:27:29] B is for biomarkers blood based biomarkers specifically cholesterol markers especially the deeper dive I just want to take my hat off to you Richard you do more detailed lipid profiling than most cardiologists do I remember the first time I sat down with you I was fully expecting you to just whip out like the LDL HDL triglycerides are this and you went deep I mean you had a poby you had LDL P you had particles subtype you really got into it and I was like why is the neurologist knowing all of this stuff when every cardiologist seems to like still be in the dark ages on this drives me crazy you know essentially we have four cardiologists now in the practice actually one who listens to the podcast

[01:28:10] I give him a shout-out she probably shouldn't say his name you know it's not serious man what's up really great guy actually has been a great he's a patient but he's been a mentor and a teacher to me too and you know we have cardiologists in the practice someone who's luyt was like totally anti like what are you ordering and he's still anti all that stuff but he really wants to know his numbers and he really wants me to interpret it but the first patience you know I don't use this stuff what are some of the other biomarkers you focus on so the four main categories are cholesterol but deep dive cholesterol inflammation however there's just for inflammation labs and they're just not great but it's just in our panel so what are you looking at besides CRP and fibrinogen what if you look at il-1 il-6

[01:28:46] TNF yeah I wish baby steps it's my love peroxidase and LP ple to which I don't exactly know what to do with but yeah fibrinogen interesting and high sensitive CRP now that I see all the results and our outcomes HSC RP is probably the most informative but you know something like Milo peroxidase is a risk factor for vascular cognitive impairment later that's a new study so I don't exactly know what to do with the inflammatory markers but we're checking them and what stands in the way of adding some interleukins to that some of the money Benjamin's I would love to get better nutritional biomarkers which we'll talk about we do it in the serum we absolutely need to do it in the red blood cell but we need to send it to a different place and a different FedEx account and this is the thing can I just

[01:29:29] I'm just gonna get back on my soapbox goddammit I'm allowed to do this I guess this is the one perk of having your show if you're listening to this and you're in some way touched by Alzheimer's disease either because you have a family member who's got it or you're concerned about anything like that and you're considering like funding research and

[01:29:44] Alzheimer's disease I can't emphasize enough the importance of funding the type of research that Richard does whether that means funding Richard directly or somebody else because Alzheimer's prevention is so underfunded it is an embarrassment to this disease State and so and I've had patients who have said to me you know a loved one just passed away and I'd like to throw $100,000 at something for Alzheimer's research and I think to myself luckily those patients like to give that money to you because you can do more with $100,000 in new york clinic immediately $100,000 doesn't buy you five animals to do a study on a drug that has a ninety nine point six percent chance of not working let me repeat that the success rate of Pharmacology for

[01:30:26] Alzheimer's disease is 0.4 percent in other words ninety nine point six of drugs brought forth to treat Alzheimer's disease are abject failures now if you are interested in the philanthropic side of Alzheimer's disease and you want to put more money in that pot you must ask yourself the question which is what is the definition of crazy is it throwing more money into the same pile that's taking the same approach to a disease that's not working or is it possibly looking to this novel idea of

[01:30:56] Alzheimer's prevention okay rant over off the soapbox let's go back and it's funny like if I would have had seventy five thousand dollars more three years ago I would have had the right biomarkers so I could definitively say about which omega-3 which this which that I could have for $75,000 you know we've gone through eight million dollars in five years okay it's not too bad actually I mean for a major research program five million of it philanthropy three million NIH and other grants seventy five thousand dollars extra I could have definitive evidence about which omega-3s to take is at ala DHA EPA

[01:31:35] I think it's DHA and EPA but I wasn't doing the right biomarkers cuz I couldn't afford the right tests so for the littlest tiny investments you know we have a data set with 3,000 pieces of data on every patient we have such a deep phenotypic characterization I have thousands of pages of data I don't know how I'm gonna write this up I need to hire two full-time people for $50,000 per person we can churn out papers you know two papers every few months so the take-home point is in an imprecise world in an imperfect world where I don't have unlimited funds we have to be cautious so we've done the best we can but oh man

[01:32:09] I wish if we could have tnf-alpha interleukins and CD 50s and I wish we could yeah and I think the way to think about this if again if you're listening to this and you're trying to understand how should funding be allocated you have to think about this as how would you hedge right so I'm not suggesting for a moment that no effort should be made at doing research around Alzheimer's treatment I mean the disease is devastating and you don't have to meet but one person who suffers from this disease to think we should be throwing heaven and earth at figuring how to treat these patients the question is how would you balance that portfolio because right now that portfolio is about ninety nine to one nine eleven point nine dollars are going into treatment point one dollars going into prevention I'm asking simply what if it were ninety ten but if it were ninety dollars that go into treatment and $10 into prevention in reality I think if it were 1090 we'd move the needle even more if we were willing to acknowledge that hey a lot of people can't be helped right now which is an awful message to consider so anyway I do think that prevention suffers from a number of things it's way squishier there's always going to be a bias against the idea that you can get people to change behaviors lifestyle behaviors in other words it's one thing to get a patient to take their pill it's quite another thing to get a page to change the way they sleep the way they meditate if they do at all the way they exercise the way they eat these things are harder to do that's the downside the upside is if you can do those things I think the evidence is pointing to you can have a much bigger impact oh yeah and if when you do this precision medicine approach where you look at their cholesterol inflammation metabolism we'll talk about in a second nutrition biomarkers genetics and you take all these factors and you look at their body fat and you look at their cognitive function which we'll talk about a B's and C's you can then give them a personalized precision medicine plan and they end up getting that right plan and then the outcome is better and then they're going to have positive reinforcement to where they're gonna keep doing it I have people that I haven't been able to lose weight my whole life are you doing the wrong thing you were on elliptical for 20 minutes three times a week that's not gonna get you to lose weight that may get you to maintain yourself a little bit but not really you need to do high-intensity interval training you need to lose body fat here's your fat here's your this here's your that when you attack it with knowledge about the non one-size-fits-all approach and the N of one do everything and everything based on your individual biology and genetics that's when a person can have the most success when they have success it's positive reinforcement yeah and I think seeing those biomarkers improve I saw three patients today in clinic and in all cases were reviewing labs and it's really they loved it yeah they really like to be able to especially the ones that dial into this stuff that think oh wow look at how this change led to that but not this and what do I need to do more here and I mean I guess in the end one of the challenges is you and I both have a luxury that not not a lot of doctors to which is we have small practices that allow us that luxury of and so hopefully some of these other tools you're developing will allow physicians to be able to scale themselves a little bit by saying look I you know dr. Smith might not have as much time as dr. Isaacson to sit down and spend an hour with each patient going over this stuff but I can at least point a patient to a tool that can help streamline this process when I'm sleeping without an EPR or without any or anything just cus the way the internet works when I sleep and wake up my ex-girlfriend with the phone the phone thing I was trying to show off and impress she said well you work so much and every time you get a lecture okay fine but make money while you're sleeping well it's the same thing I want to help people and educate people I'm sleeping you're right I see seven patients in a day sometimes five because it takes a lot of time but when I'm sleeping over a thousand patients are on that free education website with two hours of interactive educational content about Alzheimer's prevention that's how we impact live so I'm hoping that we can increase that from a thousand to eighty six hundred patients while you're sleeping I would reference nurse we'll get the reference to that so does my pocket book absolutely so and it's everything's free and we don't charge for any of this stuff but that was an inside joke so I guess as we go back to the a B's and C's so the other by own blood biomarkers that we could probably wax poetic and talk about for another several hours of his metabolism because

[01:36:24] I believe Alzheimer's is a metabolic disease in the vast majority of cases and we look at again talk about climbing a mainstream view yet I mean that was such an out-there view six seven years ago is it less out there now it's hard to ignore the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes have a disproportionate risk what the amyloid eccentric people in the Taoists the amyloid and tau people the Taoists analysis we tell is cool right I would like to be at ours yeah I called amyloid eccentric but other people say the Baptist Baptist means bad news in mab which is an anti amyloid drug anyway the Baptist Taoists whatever I'm a mitochondrial list or whatever it is what I would say is those people that don't get it most people don't understand that the leaders in the Alzheimer's field that are like leading major initiatives like two of the most major initiatives and

[01:37:12] Alzheimer's disease one is led actually both are led by non clinical physicians that have never seen an Alzheimer's patient so Fox rant number - coming up now this would be a good time to hit forward by two minutes if you don't want to hear the rant you know few things chap my ass more than the leaders in the field treating clinical diseases who don't treat patients and I often get asked like do you one day see yourself not actually practicing medicine but instead just focusing on the types of research and collaborative things that you can do and the answer is always no the day you stop seeing patients is the day you stop getting humbled by and reminded of what the hell you do this for and what you just said is staggering yeah what I would not have guessed yeah when I found out this one person had no clinical training and basically did some radiology trash I don't talk about specifics but and the other person like a related kind of field but not psychiatry not geriatrics like not the traditional anything drives you crazy and then and then you have this conversation with them or are you saying oh hey nice to meet you in they say I heard about you give me the scowl they give me that scowl at least they're saying now because you're such a lowlife neurologist who's like on the ground actually touching these patients yeah I mean I heard about who you're that guy or or prevention burger at least they're saying multiple shots on goal maybe we need to look at other targets aside from amyloid and tau that's at least what they're saying all right we'll tell you that's progress I'll take it and the tomatoes are getting thrown at me less and less which is good so let's go back to metallian for a guy who doesn't cook this is a highly inefficient use of tomatoes like if someone threw a bunch of tomatoes at me I could make some nice sauce yeah I've turned on my oven once and that was in 2001 before you started storing your motherís well my textbook served that was in 2001 I started putting my textbooks in there because I had no room in Boston I've actually I've put my textbooks and other things in my oven for a long time I live in a tiny apartment I have two dogs two cats a guy in the couch is a problem guys got venting and I talked to my therapist and

[01:39:16] I figure out why your fiancee hasn't moved to New York yet ah if I wonder why yeah I guess I have no insight into what and the guys do one floor long hair oh no she's in California she's in Cal Cal one of those things we have a bicoastal dog cat whatever a guy in the couch definitely got to go by the time she comes back is he listening to this no he's not a podcast listener there's no risk that he's gonna be offended by the fact that you said he's gotta go no no I don't have to cut that part up no no he's got long hair the hairs everywhere it's just like so messy anyway back to metabolism that metabolism woody measuring metabolism do do oral glucose-tolerance test well dr. Peter Atia has schooled me on this more than one time and I would love to however we can only do not have the budgets we can do yeah and the time and the trickiness but sure I'm not doing everything as precise as I need to and you know you're the one that's taught me about how you know you can have fluctuations and sugar up and down but then the average hemoglobin a1c is normal but you're missing those other things so so we we do it better than maybe the average Joe but we look at hemoglobin a1c we look at homei our we look at fasting insulin we look at fasting blood glucose which I really like even though its imprecise it just does give me a good snapshot we look at apone nekton which is confusing sometimes so you know these are some of the main we used to look at more things and then it was expensive so we do the best we can but then we triangulate so the key here in the AP are there any other classes of biomarkers I'm sorry nutrition nutrition yes will you look at their suppose this is our problem because we look at saturated fat monounsaturated fat DHA epa ala you know all the sorts of stuff based on what food frequency questionnaire no knowing in the blood oh man you measuring RBC levels of all of these no that's the problem we were measuring serum levels it's a problem oh yeah that's a problem I know our killer disco that's hence my $75,000 whatever that got sucked away back in 2013 we know those 2015 we had money for this and then things happen sometimes so other words the sea the sea is as important as the a and the B and I never would have said this five years ago or even thought that I would be talking about something this ridiculous but C is cognitive function it doesn't sound ridiculous well well using cognitive function to personalize your individualize a person's care from a biological perspective that sounded ridiculous to me five years ago but we look at processing speed attention memory executive function all of these different cognitive domains when I see lipids I now see executive function and I see vitamin D and homocysteine I said hmm could that be processing speed when I see metabolism problems and high visceral body fat that screaming memory metabolism and memory and what we do so this is news to me like I didn't oh me too yeah so are you seeing this as is this just basically a blind squirrel has found some nuts like you're just digging through your data and these patterns are emerging no not that you know this is clinical this is clinical observation this because you're generating clinical data yeah this is pre data analysis and you know some of the data analysis doesn't even hold up with maybe my clinical observations because people are different and when you lump Bob and Jim and whoever else together all in the bunch so these are just very loose sort of observations that are becoming now testable hypotheses right and the testable hypotheses are tricky here because what we do is more traditional statistics we do your means and averages and you know all the fancy at least squares means and whatever Bayesian yada yada but we probably need to be doing n of one studies and n of one is a way to which Kent brings us back to AI yeah and until you have the AI engine totally and

[01:42:54] I was a computer dork in a past lifetime and I would do artificial intelligence with my life if I had a billion dollars tomorrow I would fund my research and get the right people on the bus to do all the things I want to do and I would focus professionally on programming and artificial intelligence because that's how we can really beat this stuff that's in the I'm getting on my ran through my that was my soapbox time but long story short is n of one people where you can make these associations and you average it all together in the cohort and it gets too hazy but metabolism and memory metabolism and learning in memory specifically and what we do here and this is the key triangulating on the A's the B's and the C's so never say oh your blood sugar fasting is 97 you need to do

[01:43:36] X Y or Z differently nananana 97 that's above 95 and that's my cutoff of normal for brain health memory and cognitive function which is less than the 100 cutoff which in med school it was 125 and then 116 a residency it's 100 and hopefully in five years to be 95 I don't know what you think a fasting blood sugar is appropriate in terms of a reference range but for brain health I think it's 95 based on some work from Germany so what we do is we take the A's the B's in the C's we triangulate the information only then do you make a clinical decision and you can't just treat based on one you have to interpolate everything and when you do that that's when you can come up with the clinical precision medicine plan what cut-offs are you using on your lipids these days let's just go with LDL particle oh gosh this is confusing because I don't want to talk about bimodal curves and maybe people with too high HDL s can be bad and I mean there's a lot of complexity here and it's an individual and this is a phenotype thing like I just see Tempe cholesterol ester transfer whatever I don't know what that gene is called but I can see that the person has the gene because I can feel it in my gut and I can look at the labs and I can just I can based on their HDL cholesterol you mean or the combination of their HDL particle and HDL cholesterol in size it's really hard for me to give generalities because there are certain people where the rules don't apply or the rules apply backwards so

[01:44:56] LDL cutoff Ashurst absolutely below 100 I love below 70 what about in the particle sub a thousand but 600 500 better than 8 or 900 maybe but I don't really know for sure and are you concerned that statin use even though at the population level statin use is always associated with a lower risk of dementia that in certain individuals it can exacerbate it I hate to say this but yes and five years ago I would have said heck no a statin should be in the drinking water I'm very Pro statin period just like you said population-based I'm very pro statin because of this clinical observation where you see patient after patient after patient and you see genotype and then phenotype and whatever I do believe that different statins work differently in different people I think there's a gender difference I think when in doubt low dose is better I think people with a bowi for genes especially to a point for genes holy cow you have to be careful I think you were the one that talking about live alone and then I learned more about you know Crestor and high potency and low potency and lipophilic and blah blah blah you know on how a tour of a statin showed to be beneficial and men with slowing hippocampal atrophy but women and you know and I've just seen men change from one cholesterol drug to another because hey their numbers look great but another memory got worse high potency statin April before maybe we need to come down a little bit so I am

[01:46:17] Pro statin period and I think I'm Pro stat let me just say that but I'm anti one-size-fits-all yeah I mean I think this is one of those things in medicine that I think is very hard for people to understand which is how can something like a statin potentially be good and potentially be bad and the reality of it is it can be very positive from a vascular standpoint can be positive from an inflammatory standpoint it could be negative from a cholesterol biosynthesis standpoint in a susceptible individual and so I mean like you I consider myself

[01:46:48] Pro everything under the right conditions I'm pro hammers when I have a nail and a piece of wood but I'm pro Phillips screwdriver when I have a Philips screw and if he said drywall perfect yeah that's a great point so and then there's plant sterols and zeti and this and that and omega-3s and I like omega-3s to get down and you mentioned earlier on the omega-3 front I mean I think in the last year and a half actually during the time when we were writing that manuscript I think it became a little bit more clear that it might even be the DHA and it works better in ephors but it just takes years to work to have the most robust takes two and a half years I think to recycle the amount of DHA in a person's brains and when you study it for six months and you're only getting 20 hours you guys

[01:47:28] I'm sorry you guys mean rant number three soapbox again when someone says such-and-such an agent was studied and it had no effect should you immediately dismiss the intervention only if you can be confident that it was that it was studied correctly and that the time course of the disease in the intervention were appropriately matched and it's that latter point that almost always seems to be the missing link and that's a great example of that frankly half the primary prevention studies and disease

[01:48:00] I think missed the mark because they don't understand the time course of the disease that's being studied and the other part about this is you know if you do this one-size-fits-all and you give say Omega threes to everybody but people with high omega-3s maybe don't need it but then they lump the results together well guess what the study's gonna be negative maybe you should have just given you a mega the people that actually needed it and that would have been your enrollment criteria then your outcome would have been different so precision medicine in this whole one-size-fits-all thing is just you know very dichotomous so so yeah we take these ABCs and we generate evidence-based and safe from patient education you know two hours more online interactive education online for free patient counseling with me and Holly and then we really type out a whole plan and this is four pages five pages and so in which patients not to get too tactical but I know that a lot of people listening to this are probably chomping at the bit to know some of the things I mean we've alluded to a number of these things now another one that's really come on my radar in the last two years is a specific type of curcumin called

[01:49:00] Terra cumin can you talk a little bit about what that is how it works and why Shirin and I have nothing to disclose I did a Medscape piece on tharok Kerman and man I got Tomatoes thrown at me in the comment section this one ER doctor and in Kansas hopefully he's not listen to this actually call that's what he is listening yeah well actually called him to discuss and the secretary in the ER said we don't give you're wrong or whatever out but you know I have nothing to disclose and I don't so supplement don't have a supplement company I'm sorry no I wish I have hundreds of thousands of student loans my fiance has four hundred and fifty thousand dollars didn't have a recommendation if you could start monetizing your bling phones there might be a way to start putting a dent in those this is this is a very unique audience is interested in these though so I'd have to spend money to find that person if you know any oligarchs that's what usually uh if you can find a Chinese billionaire I have a

[01:49:51] Chinese have that Chinese phone and then this white alligator skin one so they want to part with this so you wrote this thing in Medscape about Thera cumin yeah and I got a nice trying to sell things really so just for disclosure I wish but I've made a conscious decision not to I live in a one-bedroom apartment with two dogs two cats and a guy in the couch it's my bathroom is the size of a closet

[01:50:12] I live in New York City I have tons of loans I am negative when it comes to my net worth since moving to New York five years ago I don't need a sob story I have a roof over my head I'm very fortunate whatever but I am NOT trying to make money I'm not trying to sell stuff so although I probably should not

[01:50:27] I'm not selling my phone though so when it comes to theremin it is a specific type that comes from Japan and this Japanese company from my understanding I'm basically made this nanoparticle small particle version now there are versions of curcumin that may be optimized for absorption and blah blah blah but in the Alzheimer's study by

[01:50:45] John ringman and colleagues when they did a randomized study on curcumin for mild to moderate Alzheimer's this study was negative but when they did the blood samples the curcumin was being swallowed and not being absorbed in the blood so I wonder why curcumin didn't work so this basically led to this Japanese company putting together this ferric Yurman version nanoparticles whatever it is and a study by Gary small and colleagues basically showed that after 18 months of using it when you look at PET scans there was less amyloid in the group that got the real optimize so does that mean we should be using thorough human even in our non high-risk ad patients that we would otherwise be giving curcumin to precision medicine no one-size-fits-all so sorry to you know get back on that soapbox but no not everyone I don't think needs curcumin I think it depends on what their ABCs are you know if they have some inflammatory stuff well I'm not checking the right inflammatory stuff so I can't use that as a biomarker they have some memory stuff well maybe if they're at higher risk and they have any belief or gene maybe it was the dose if there are cumin in that small study well meaning the author the size yeah it's two pills a day 500 600 maybe I just it's two pills a day read the label read the study I'm forgetting but it's one pill a day for well there are several companies that sell tharok human now are just one several companies yet so again I'm not vouching for any brand but as you said earlier Peter you know you you taught me which methyl yada yada to use and it works every time and it's like finally we have a good version um I do vouch for that for the listener it that brand that we've switched to across the board is J rose they have a combined lozenge that's methylfolate and methyl b12 yellow bottle with and so you know we choose specific supplements because we know that they work and they're verified and you know we've used them and we can see it jumping in the blood so we know it works

[01:52:30] Thera Kerman is tharok human i'm even know how to pronounce it i don't think everyone needs to be on it but i do think if you're gonna be on it and you have amyloid in your brain you better be on the right stuff so it's important should someone take more I have no idea I've never told someone to take more but I have this family that to multiple actually two families three that have the gate before

[01:52:52] Jean and the tnf-alpha Jean well how does curcumin work they don't a tnf-alpha pathway what we've been doing is then we can add additional labs that cost money but you got to do what you got to do sometimes and we look at CD 50 and other inflammatory markers and TNF and while TNF isn't really changing for example in multiple patients that we put on this tharok Yurman the CD 50's increasing so I don't exactly know what that means but I do know that their memories not getting worse and maybe hopefully over time will get better so has anybody commented on this rise in CD 50 I've never really talked about it before

[01:53:24] I mean you've sent me this these data but is there anything in the literature about CD 50 I'm not aware I you know my brain can only hold so many things I'm a 1/3 preventive cardiologist when I shouldn't be and you know I have a great guy Randy Cowan bless his heart he's just been I email him and he emails you back at 48 hours I have this phone a friend list of people that are way smarter than me but but you know I'm one-third preventive cardiologist make believe one I'm one-third neurologist and one-third primary care doctor and I just can't internalize all this stuff so

[01:53:52] I email you and I have this like group of like 12 to 15 mensches that just help me for free and it's amazing so don't know what to say what do you think of as kind of like the five most important things you tell a person so let's say you're at a cocktail party and someone finds out what you do for a living by the way when I'm at a cocktail party if I'm ever asked what I do there are only two responses I sell carpet or sofa beds that's my dad that's a great answer

[01:54:19] I'm either a shepherd or a race car driver you look like a race car driver you're gonna said look like a shepherd and now well you have that a sheep thing in the corner over there yeah yeah the sheep herding stick yeah racecar driver is a great it's just a great way to not talk about Formula one yeah but let's say you're at the cocktail party someone corners you in a moment of weakness you've explained exactly what you do or they've listened to this podcast and they see your picture and then they come up - and they go hey you're Richard Isaacson and they say look I'm 30 years old right I'm as healthy as a horse there is nothing wrong with me I couldn't even begin to relate to cognitive impairment but you know my grandmother was diagnosed with

[01:54:59] Alzheimer's disease when she was seven two years old and by 80 she was dead and let's just assume that the patient doesn't know their apoE status or any of these other things you're not gonna see this patient again you know you're at a cocktail party and Los Angeles and you're falling back the next day what are five things that you would put in the no regret move list that you could say to that person even at a general level I hate to be general like to general but one is knowledge is power learn about brain health now because brain health incremental changes that you make now at 30 40 50 whatever the earlier the better but throughout the lifespan learn about brain health so I will refer them to this website again it's free ails you org there's been 1.1 million people that have been on the site I'll never be able to treat a hundred thousand people in my clinic so go to the site learn every single thing possible I can't tell you everything are there diagnostic tests that people can do to get a sense of their own cognitive abilities there are we don't give results at this time we have like one test that gives results but it's for research purposes so it's for tracking it's for track so a patient can say I'll take the test on ales of you once a year and there's email reminders to tell you to attend and do they get results if their performance deteriorates or do you get a result no this is for research purposes only so everything's decoded so right now we don't give results but give us a little more time and we unfortunately don't have the funding to analyze this 1 million strong cohort because when you get a million points of data it's very expensive to analyze and we don't have the right statistical team so step one is at least go and familiarize yourself with all of this information yeah and I'm not trying to be like oh whatever I'm not trying to like everyone wants that like what do I do now do it what pills should I take how much should I exercise what's the magic dose to me it's like if you're gonna really get serious about brain health it's just not that simple our intake at the clinics an hour and a half cognitive an hour-and-a-half with me filling out a 45-minute survey taking courses online before you can even get an appointment with me you have to do all this pre stuff Alzheimer's French is not simple take the time you're gonna be watching

[01:57:00] YouTube or flipping through Facebook or doing whatever the heck you're doing to waste time on your cell phone late at night take the course online you're gonna learn things internalize them make incremental changes number one is education Nelson Mandela said education is the most powerful tool to change the world whatever whatever the quote was that I mangled but education is number one number two is know your numbers okay what do I do they want me actionable tips actionable that know take a step back know your numbers what is your blood pressure what is your pulse what is your body fat what is your weight what is your cholesterol what is your blood sugar know everything about yourself your body is a temple that's a saying know everything about you know you and I use the aura ring I believe I use a bio sensor nothing to disclose whatever I know everything I do have something to disclose which I disclose publicly I have invested in aura and I advise them so please make sure everybody knows yeah of course so I won't know everything about my physiology about my sleep how many hours when I go to sleep when I whatever how much my exercise is what my strain is what my output is what my average heart rate is my my resting pulse I want to know I'm a data junkie right now the person's ready to spill their drink on you they're like I got it

[01:58:08] I'm gonna memorize the site I'm gonna learn everything about me but I want to know is there anything that I should be doing more or less of with respect to exercise food sleep meditation yoga supplements are there any no regret move so exercise is the number one thing any person can do the only thing a person can do right now if they have amyloid in their brain to reduce it or slow the accumulation is exercise on a regular basis yeah when we were writing up what our white paper that eventually became the basis for the paper we collaborated on I remember when Dan first presented to me just internally like all of his findings I guess I should take a step back and explain why we did this because

[01:58:48] I think it provides an example of how we started working together but I remember he said that he was like Peter you're not gonna like this answer but like there's literally only one thing in the literature that suggests that you have any hope of mitigating Alzheimer's disease and I was like let me see if I can guess and I came up with like 10 guesses and they were all wrong and he goes no it's exercise and I was like okay I mean I get that exercise is important but are you telling me that in the literature exercise is the only thing that meets level one evidence for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and and look I mean that's an important thing to know I would say risk reduction yeah reproduction so we can we could wax philosophically on why by the way the reason we ended up doing this is we read a review article by Dale bredesen who many the listeners will probably recognize I don't know Dale I've never met him I don't even think we've exchanged emails but we read a paper that was a pretty exhaustive paper based on his recommendations for Alzheimer's prevention and we just wanted to start from first principles and there were 200 or so references in the paper and pour I don't know Dan or Bob or one or two analysts got the task of please go and get every one of those references and make sure the references line up with what's being said and I don't think this is deliberate I think this is just the nature of what happens to be learning papers but like we couldn't verify a third of these references for example there was one reference that said take risks very trawl and we went to that paper and that paper while it was about resveratrol it had nothing to do with resveratrol awesomer surrender so so that's when we decided we'd wanted to do this from first principles we wanted to go and take a first principles approach and we had a unusual methodology as you recall which was start from an intervention look at in an intermediary and understand a mechanistic pathway and then how does it lead to the convergence of a final common pathway and so in many ways Dale's work was helpful to get us started but we felt that we wanted to do better could we do better if we were able to abandon everything that had been done so exercise let's go back to the woman at the cocktail party she wants to exercise is there a type of exercise do we have any belief that you talked about high intensity training do we believe that that's better than sitting on the elliptical for 30 minutes or going for a run or lifting weights here I go again not one size fits all but know your numbers what is your body fat what is your muscle mass men body fat is less important potentially muscle mass is probably more protective on brain health women body fat is why do we think that is smart people smarter than me and told me this mechanistically what does it glucose disposal is it circulating factors IGF seems to be somewhat protective that's not pass over my pay grade or whatever that's saying is yeah I don't not a hundred percent sure but I can tell you that mixing it up is important the vast majority of evidence out there is aerobic exercise minimum of 150 to 180 minutes a week for example and that's mixing it up most people would say based on the preponderance of evidence two-thirds cardio one-third strength training but someone's gonna have to personalize it based on themselves you know for me I spun this morning I'm I do spin class I was never a spin person like and this is not I don't want to get I go to flywheel

[02:01:51] I love flywheel and peloton why do I like those two because I know my numbers I can see my it's actually competitive because I think I can race against people in the class but it tells me what my torque is what my average output is and that way I can know I can see well what is my pulse what is my strain was just to be clear when you talk about I think anybody can dog it but if you're doing a peloton class right you're working up a sweat I mean it's it's a very different experience than I'm gonna go on the elliptical and watch the news while I'm raising my pulse from 80 to 90 that doesn't seem to count as exercise oh no and it's like I talked about the patient's all the time they say oh my god an elliptical three times a week I do 45 minutes I'm like really well yeah it's great I don't mind it is that type of talk to my friends a text on a bird do that watch TV in Mike spin class I can't talk I can grunt that's about it I can grunt and then I am a absolute mess and the amount of you know my average pulse rate during a class is over 150 no no 155 ish sometimes higher sometimes lower and my max is gonna be say 180 you know give or take I know these numbers so high-intensity interval training is important but you got to be careful because if you do too much you're gonna burn muscles so I have you can hurt yourself yeah exactly and you know I started off very low weight and I was getting back into exercise several years ago and I am you know now I'm at higher weights but I do weights at least once a week I hate weight training but I should probably do it twice a week I probably only do it on average once maybe once and a half you definitely need to be doing it two or three times it's a big it's a big problem I completely understand you and my primary care doctor who is like a clone of you and son in a different way if you want no other proof point just look at all of her sacks do you know like what a beast that guy was there was like a powerlifting champion in medical school and residency when he passed away there were some really really remarkable tributes to this man who not only is I didn't have the luxury of knowing him I did you he's lectured at a seminar I talked to him for about 10 seconds oh wow yeah I had never the luxury of knowing this remarkable human being but I was amazed after his passing to learn so much about him that I didn't know because you know you always saw man he looked like a fit strong guy in photos as an older guy but then to see pictures of this guy in his 20s and 30s I was like my college is powerlifter you're the neurologist DJ he can be then irrelevant powerful indeed so muscle strength so she's loosening her grip on the glass now you've actually given her that that leads to my next question should she be drinking alcohol or more to the point should she think about moderating her

[02:04:20] Alps sure so so alcohol wouldn't go in my top 5 because there's a lot of other automation of alcohol would not be unlike my 5 like most important things you know you've seen Collins in 2011 or so came out with a paper that basically said one to two drinks a day in men and one drink a day and women is probably protective then you have all these new

[02:04:39] UK studies that show actually if you do 0 that's better so there's the data is a little bit all over the place I kind of hedged my bets and I say women four drinks a week men seven to ten and other people that are really smart that I work with says less sorry is the distinction you make in women to be lower because the risk is higher or do you think it's related more to body mass or muscle mass the latter and body mass muscle mass and the data and the data what the data shows I'm not sure those data kind of suspect I think there's so much healthy user bias and those data that I but again I think one also has to balance you know I sort of think of alcohol like

[02:05:15] I think of tylenol there is no dose of Tylenol that isn't taxing your liver right so if you are asking the question as a hepatocyte the smallest cell within a liver how much tylenol is too much it's like any amount becomes too much any amount becomes taxing so the question is if you take a hepatis entropy of Tylenol you should never ever ever consume it but the reality of it is we're not just walking livers we're walking people and sometimes we have fevers and sometimes we have pain and things for which tylenol is a remarkable drug so we have to balance that and so similarly I would say alcohol is a known hepatic Thaksin there is no dose of ethanol that isn't on some level chronically toxic to the liver the question is we're not walking livers therefore are there benefits of alcohol that may in the early stages of administration offset some of the downside and I think the answer for some people probably is yes I mean I have patients who if they don't sit there and sip their con yak at night it's it's very difficult for them to unwind and well I could sit there and lecture them about how they need to pick a different unwinding practice in the end if you can monitor a bunch of things you know I do sort of take the view that says look it's there's no measurable harm that's being done by this your liver function tests are incredibly low your coagulation factors are low it's not producing other adverse arm'd maybe there's benefit but it'll be interesting to see how that story shakes out in

[02:06:40] Alzheimer's disease because you could certainly come up with plausible hypothesis on either side of that yeah I have much stronger ever done some other things so since the evidence is murky I always hedge my bets like you say sometimes and less is more but I'm not sure little bits so where is the were the domes where you feel strong so so nutrition has to come after exercise but again education know your numbers because nutrition is a close second probably I mean honestly vascular risk factor modification is probably after exercise so I should probably put nutrition next but vascular risk factor modification cholesterol diabetes blood pressure control the Sprint mind study just if you haven't heard about the study it's like a major major major important study in the field that needs to be unlike every yeah it's really modified the way I think about blood pressure man yeah I mean and this was a five-year study it was the Sprint study which is trying to figure out do people you know because lowering blood pressure less than 140 has always been a little bit unclear like does it improve outcomes so this study and cardiovascular disease was and I may be paraphrasing but does is 140s better or is 1:20 better systolic and you know there's always been this like Dogma where oh you got to be careful you can't lower blood pressure too much and someone who's older because they're gonna over 70 oh they're gonna pass out they're gonna have bad outcomes and fall so in the sprint mind study they into the study early because the outcomes were so much better in the 120s that actually no there wasn't no side-effects either so they stopped the study early well the Sprint mine study then looked at outcomes several years later to remind study this is just like a several years and follow-up and like not like ten or twenty just even after a few years and this intervention was not that long actually showed a reduction in in the people that had blood pressure more tightly controlled to a systolic of 120 actually had a reduction in development of MCI mild cognitive impairment by nineteen percent like that is huge over how many years two years I think it was like after three and a half fish four years of treatment of lower and then they stopped the study at five years or whatever and then three years later or something like that I'm angling it but long story short I mean nineteen percent risk reduction of MCI and then you add in the exercise and the blueberries and the low carbs and the this and the precision medicine I mean we're talking tangible like real real let's go to nutrition why blueberries anthocyanins some dangling had to pronounce that to

[02:09:01] Robert Krekorian pioneer I believe in the field of nutrition research and Alzheimer's the antioxidants you think provide benefit you would be the person to ask about this but I'm I know he has a paper that he's been trying to figure out is the blueberry is that the anther Sam and is it the whole fruit is can you just take out the compound I don't know that I'm a hundred percent sure I think it may just be the compound I'm gonna I actually got an email about this in my news you know we get those newsletters every day about Alzheimer's disease and

[02:09:27] I think they mentioned this in today's newsletter which was yeah just the idea was could this be one of the more potent antioxidants that could be studied in clinical trials cuz you know doctor Krekorian is looking at you know not just blueberry intake but he the wild blueberries is a non wild then we say okay well what about blueberry powder can we just take the blueberry powder well then come and go even deeper can we just take the active ingredient so nutrition research people say well first of all nutrition research is hard to study but there's a science to nutrition research and you know just randomizing a hundred people to one diet versus another people aren't mice you can't just like make sure that they diet people go to McDonald's and like do other things that they shouldn't do so nutrition research is inherently those bad I'm just taking notes here for the girl at the girl right now McDonald's is not my cousin Stacy and caught me at

[02:10:17] McDonald's once and got pictures it was a problem but you know everything in moderation everything in moderation I have had to make flurries and Orion like flurries in the last year like once in a while I'm not judging by the way I'm just craving one my stop Oh Oreo McFlurry smen like forget it anyway long story you don't you don't even have sugar in your house I'd hit put xylitol in my coffee killing me man so nutrition would be you know lower carbs good carbs versus bad carbs green leafy vegetables so so so important a role of fasting any early data on intermittent fasting or caloric restriction well I don't have data in my practice just yet but we recommend our diploma diet is looking at 12 hours versus 16 hours and the differential effects unfortunately I have looked at that data not written up unpublished there's a lot of noise I think 16 is better 5 times a week better than 12 I don't know the 12 works the error bars and our data are so wide the sample size is too small and there's too much variability at this point you sent me some of those data oh yeah I think I did yeah I that's why we need to take all these different clinics and all these different programs and get a uniform data set so so that's a pretty good list I think you've given her five things yeah and you know stress reduction is important and you know whether it's meditation or blah blah blah do whatever you need to do to de-stress deep breaths sleep is super important I'm getting adequate sleep you don't lose fat and you don't get healthy if you're not sleeping well and it's the same thing you aged terribly when you're not sleeping well a so there's a lot of components sleep so I guess they're reciprocal to this question we're now no longer the cocktail party but we're sitting back here at the table everything that you described to this woman is a quote unquote lifestyle based meaning the top five things that you suggested that she would do once she understood her baseline all have to do with modifying how she eats drinks exercises sleeps and manages stress what that makes me wonder is when we see the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease today higher than it was 40 years ago well the I'm terrible within sighs shouldn't admit this on a recorded podcast but the rate of Alzheimer's case is actually coming down the incidence is coming to instance coming down but prevalence is going up because of our aging population but the incidence today is still much higher than it was 40 years ago even though it's less than what it was ten years ago and as you said of course the prevalence which is I think of the prevalence is the integral right it's the area under the curve of what you're accumulating is so much higher both of these facts taken together suggest there is something triggering environmentally

[02:12:44] Alzheimer's disease more today than 40 years ago which is usually a constellation of these lifestyle factors so do you believe that the difference in prevalence today from the year we were born is what percent a result of the changes in these environmental factors you just mentioned versus what percent an increase in awareness and diagnostic acumen I've written on this and my answer is I don't know but it's some combination of it's both it's both yeah

[02:13:11] I mean you know Alzheimer's is a huge stigma and shame right now people are coming out of the shadows and talking about it more and there's like young people that are talking about you know Seth Rogen has this charity hilarity for charity and they're raising money for Alzheimer's education and young people I mean they're talking about Alzheimer's and high school students and college students and medical students I mean like the conversation is not only like getting better but you have like people that are speaking up on its behalf and adding a new new flavor to it so so there's much less stigma much more attention to it doctors you're talking about it not just senility oh that's normal with age we now have biomarkers so sure sure we have all that but we it's this is definitely lifestyle component to you know sitting all day there's like sitting is the new smoking

[02:13:54] I think you know that I've heard whatever about that that's like really bad for the brain it's not just bad for there the bigger the belly as the belly gets larger the memory center in the brain the hippocampus gets smaller so you know metabolic conditions and lack of activity and sedentary lifestyles like it doesn't just affect the belly in the body it affects the brain cuz they're all connected so that reminds me

[02:14:17] I have another question that I have which is how much does mental activity ward this off you know we hear so often the anecdote of Burnie was working in his little tail away beavering away and then when he retired to play golf it all went to hell in a handbasket and then the other one you often hear anecdotally is once so-and-so spouse passed away oh my god the remaining spouse just regressed completely and seemed to have this accelerated case of Alzheimer's dementia so the idea here being once that person retired and they weren't cognitively engaged and they were not to say golf is cognitively bankrupt but presumably it's less cognitively engaging than whatever that person was doing before or once the sense of purpose the social support vanishes again anecdotally this seems overwhelmingly the case is there any data to support that so yes but it's complicated the cognitive reserve can't one thing just be freaking simple you know Alzheimer's prevention no no man this is sound like me man yeah everything's complex it's complicated I wish I could give it a concise bullet point state you know like I'm I want a bumper sticker yeah the live TV you got to give them like a quick snapshot not on this topic so early life risk factors for Alzheimer's are different than midlife and late life and early life risk can be mitigated most so by long-term educational attainment that's the best evidence we have we also have to be clear has that been normalized for socioeconomic status it strikes me as almost impossible to normalize that for socioeconomic status mmm both my pay grade don't know the literature as well as I mean the point here being like people who go on to get secondary and tertiary education are gonna have lower risk is it because of the things that enable them to do that perhaps having more resources lead to them doing other healthy lifestyle things that go beyond the education is I hope the studies have controlled for that but I know it's impossible to control for everything but that being said I think early life educational attainment for example musical experience midlife and midlife musical experience as well as early life absolutely can give built up greater cognitive reserves that when you get

[02:16:29] Alzheimer's you're more resilient you have this resiliency the other aspect I don't know enough about music but when you were the cello playing - bass guitar playing guy what part of the brain is getting exercise very multimodal it's the parietal lobe is a music side maybe on the right side the you know reading music notes is kind of like language so be the left side of the brain and that's visual it's basically am associating cortices basically the whole brain is talking to each other so I think music is a great way to recruit different parts of the brain to work together and the stronger those pathways get the better the person does and again teleologically that makes so much sense I guess it begs the question I would argue we will never know the answer to this question because if we're gonna have to rely on very loose epidemiology which can never be fully controlled and suffers from all of the usual problems that epidemiology suffers from the question ought to be is there any harm in believing that the epidemiology is Right attaining a higher level of Education staying more mentally engaged sustaining more loving social supporting relationships having a greater sense of purpose learning to play a musical instrument I mean is there a chance that doing those things increases your risk oh I don't think that there's been any evidence to suggest that it increases risk but then there's this whole you know the naysayers will say well what is the cost what are the trade-offs what's the what's the opportunity cost what's also the how much does it like music lessons you're gonna pay money to do music lessons or buy a guitar but shouldn't you be like buying healthy food so there's a lot of confusion and there's when we get reviewers of our papers this comes up all the time so I'm not sure all I can say is when you build a better backup pathway in the brain and you there's a saying if you don't use it you lose it well someone that has Alzheimer's and is very cognitively engaged and has a good backup pathway they're not gonna decline as quickly that being said once the disease takes hold and maybe they stopped working or they stopped the lose your sense of purpose you can have a much more sharper decline so people with high cognitive reserve high cognitive backup systems are resistant to the effects of the amyloid but there's a time that comes when they decline and those people decline much more sharply than others because they had like this emergency backup system but sometimes when the parachute fails the person goes down and in Alzheimer's disease that's a subtle that's a nuance I wouldn't have predicted it makes sense the mechanism that you postulate makes it and you gave the other example of the woman whose husband passed away and then she went downhill because when you have a collaborative relationship and you know when one person's brain isn't working well but you have another person to cover for you and do the dishes and feed you and and then that person has gone aside from depression serotonin and you have all that oh I see this all the time like I knew she had it but then the husband and you know caregivers of

[02:19:13] Alzheimer's patients have terribly higher medical illnesses and when when the husband dies and he was the primary caregiver and the wife has Alzheimer's that person will decline absolutely exponentially I saw this in a high school teacher of mine I yeah I see this all the time you know Richard your passion for this is palpable and I mean

[02:19:32] I feel like we could talk a lot more about other things including I think some of the stories of your patients are some of the most remarkable stories both the successes and the failures truthfully the failures are what keep you doing what you're doing and you are probably the hardest-working neurologist what's the expression the hardest-working man show the man chef is you know the hardest-working neurologist and show business I know you personally so I can say this from a you know from a clothes perspective your drive to help patients is a beautiful thing and I know that the patients that you get to work with directly are blessed and more importantly I think your work will have a tremendous impact on people that you will not have the luxury or privilege of laying hands on because there's only one

[02:20:14] Richard but there are lots of neurologists like you who I think want to be able to do more and I think it's really special that you have built the team around you that you have that I didn't actually know the story about the Dean of the Medical Center at Cornell taking this big chance on you I mean I knew it was obscured to have an

[02:20:30] Alzheimer's prevention clinic of course you now have the largest Alzheimer's prevention clinic in the United States it's a really heartwarming story to know that a big name Medical Center would take a risk on a young up-and-coming neurologist and sort of give him the keys to that kingdom and I hope that if one person listening to this is sort of thinking you know what that's the way I want to deploy my philanthropic dollars and Alzheimer's disease maybe I'll hedge on the side of prevention hopefully this discussion will have been worth it for you and I appreciate that you know I never asked for a single dollar until the bottom dropped out year ago and you know you Peter helped and I've never asked for money I've never asked for a single dollar what's the worst feeling in the world oh man yes but it's like so little can go so far yeah you know I sent you on the way over here an abstract like the hot-off-the-press literally we finished it at 4:32 p.m. and I forwarded to you and I got here at 5:00 and I forwarded this to you and like you read the final statement and you know this hasn't been published yet so I can't exactly gonna read it out loud or whatever and you read that statement you're like whoa this is the abstract and if I'm about to read this paper and this paper holds water this statement wow we're so close and you know we're everyday we're moving closer but that being said we have thousands of pages have already collected data that we can't really jump into so I appreciate your call to action and I can tell you that our our philanthropic funds that have come in we use immediately and yeah I on those dollars is remarkable you know there are a lot of people who say look I mean maybe I can only part with twenty five fifty thousand dollars which in New York philanthropic circles is nothing right you don't get your name on a bench for that much what a difference it can make in your clinic Oh several thousand dollars is helpful but you have 50 25 yeah I mean I can just do so much tomorrow but I'm not asking for money because that's just that I was well with that said Indian or Persian or

[02:22:27] Turkish tonight for dinner um there's a neurology resident happy hour that I may need to stop by for a second so maybe somewhere near there okay okay figure it out that's like a few blocks away but yeah I'm uh I would prefer food with no taste so and I don't do onions garlic shallots scallions all for heavens I don't do Ali

[02:22:45] I'm gonna go up dinner by myself do cilantro but no no but I like I like Plain Jane go we'll find something to talk about glucose in metabolism very loyal alright thanks so much Richard thanks Peter appreciate it you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter DMV com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers i've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
