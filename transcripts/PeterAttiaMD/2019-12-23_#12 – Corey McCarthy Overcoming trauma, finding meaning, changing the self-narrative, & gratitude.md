## Description

Original release date: 8/27/2018

Corey and Peter met when they visited North Kern State Prison in California together as volunteers for Defy Ventures. Peter was moved by Corey’s remarkable story, who is a former inmate himself, and realized he had to have him on the podcast to share his experiences with a wider audience. You’ll almost assuredly take away something very important from listening to this episode. Understanding how your experiences can define you, what forgiveness means of both yourself and others, and how good people can do bad things, are just a few of the takeaways.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com in this podcast I'll be speaking with Corey from Akkar the-- I haven't known Corey very long I first met him in April during a trip that Tim Ferriss and I took with a number of friends to North

[00:00:52] Korean state prison which is a maximum-security prison in California about an hour outside of Bakersfield we did this as volunteers with défi ventures and if you haven't heard of defy or more importantly Kathryn Hoch you should definitely go back and listen to her interview with Tim Ferriss which was done probably in January or February of this year and we'll link to that here defy is a program where volunteers like us go into prisons and participate in helping with teaching prisoners certain skills in life but I got to tell you after just that one trip there I've come to realize that the volunteers get more out of that experience than the prisoners do it's hard to really explain what we experience there and on the drive home there was about six of us in an SUV that had a five six hour drive back including Corey it was clear that it was going to be very difficult to articulate what we went through with people who didn't share that experience with us but in particular I was really moved by Corey story you see Corey himself was once an inmate and he was invited on this trip by one of my good friends and he asked hey you know I know this is kind of a small group of your buddies coming with you and Tim but could we invite Corian of course we said sure and turned out Cory was just one of the most amazing guys and in many ways the trip was stolen by him and his experiences and on the way home I I realized that I wanted to have a discussion with Cory that I wanted to be able to share with people and I think in part it's so humbling to go through this experience that we went through at Kern you start to realize that some of the smallest choices can lead you down the wrong path and so often there's a lot of pain that's at the root of bad decisions we make and I didn't know what Cory and I were gonna talk about to be completely honest I we didn't plan for it at all I didn't have a script I didn't have a single question written down we just talked and I'm really pleased with how it turned out and I hope that you'll take this on a leap of faith and listen to this because I find it impossible that anyone listening to this won't get at least something out of this understanding how your experiences can define you understanding what forgiveness means of both yourself and others understanding how good people can do bad things as you know I'm very interested in longevity but if you've been following me on social media you've probably noticed I'm becoming more and more interested in mental health and that's going to be kind of a recurring theme on this podcast because as I stated before and I think many people would sort of intuitively agree what point is there in living longer if your mind is not right if you're not happy so

[00:03:37] I hope that you'll find this discussion half as enjoyable as I did Cory is an amazing guy and I'm really excited to introduce all of you to him so without further delay here's my conversation with Cory McCarthy [Music] hey man how you doing good how are you huh pretty excited actually yeah welcome to the Big Apple yeah I like it here how often do you get down here every year for the past five or six years I've come with my daughter for Christmas time and I have some friends I might pop in once in a while room I'm your daughter's 16 17 17 she graduates from high school next week exciting Wow yeah I have a feeling we'll come back to that in a little bit thank you for making the trip down from

[00:04:25] Buffalo today this was you know something that from the day we met I was like man there's so much I want to talk about with Corey and I figured this would be kind of an interesting way to share the experience that brought us together and also talk more about your story so how did you even hear about this whole thing at defy like what brought you out to California that day so Devin is a friend of mine and that's kind of a story in itself and one that kind of one that kind of ties my whole life story together it's like everything's kind of always happened for a reason cuz Devin just so beat me I'll tell the my back end of the story yeah

[00:05:02] Devin's a friend of mine in San Diego I had told him about Kat Hoke and my trip that I was planning to defy but totally by luck because I happen to be walking into my body work who also works on Devin and as I'm walking in and Devin's walking out look I just mentioned it in passing and he was like I want to come and then the next thing I hear like two weeks later he goes hey is it cool if my buddy comes through which I was like sure and then never knew anything else till you arrived it's so cool to hear like the because that just adds to the weave of the whole thing right so dev and I only know each other because six years ago a friend of his who knew me reached out and said hey my friends got like a big brother little brother situation where he's a volunteer for this kid and the kids in kind of trouble and we think you might be able to talk to him because of your background so me and dev met through that and this was devs little brother it's not as biological yeah yeah and so and it didn't work out but dev and I kind of remained associates because of that and and his little brother who's now in his twenties was getting out of prison and

[00:06:11] I've kind of been his feet on the ground in Buffalo to walk them through what to expect what not to expect so he emailed me the email I think that you sent to him and I immediately told him like man like I just did all this research on it it looks really official I'd fly out there to do that and I like I didn't even expect for him to say that I was just kind of saying like I'd love to do that and he was like ooh let me ask and then ten minutes later he was like yeah they said it's cool that was in itself was like a challenge and it's so funny how such like a small challenge that you don't want to tackle turns into like a great thing because I had to go you had to fill out paperwork right and so did I was the paperwork I had to fill out was much more like I had to write a letter to the warden a personal letter to the warden and I had to find New York state records for me that I had to forward to them and because it's not like Who I am

[00:07:11] I got rid of that stuff so I had to go online thank God you can find pretty much anything on anybody online but so that's how I ended up there so dev invited me and I was like really excited to go and on our end the way this all started was Kat who you got to meet Kat Hoch I have four friends who have known

[00:07:32] Kat for various periods of time and so she's always sort of been someone I knew about but I didn't actually meet her God probably until earlier this year and it was only actually after I heard her on Tim's podcast that I had already reached out to her by phone but that's when I kind of reached out to her and was like look I want to come and join one of the prison visits and Tim had already agreed to do it so then I just said to Tim like let's do it together and we asked Kat which prison do you think would make the most sense and she suggested that Kearn would be a great prison to visit because of her amazing relationship with the folks there and so then it was just gonna be me and Tim and Tim was gonna invite a few people and then that's you know I bump into Devin that one day and invite him and then a couple of my friends from New York who flew out and it's okay so we get there now I got a I remember on the way up there which was like what like a five or six hour drive or some good words for you guys yeah you guys came from San Diego yeah and picked me I felt like oh that's right yeah well no it was like somewhere outside out but yeah but you probably would be the most skeptical guy going in

[00:08:43] I think me and Tim and dev and Jason like we'd we were a little more like not knowing what to expect but perhaps a bit more thinking this is gonna be really interesting and it could only be good and I got the sense like you felt like let me see how real deal this is Devin asked me the same thing over the phone before we got there and I actually said had Kat Hoke not had the history she had that I wouldn't have believed in the program or her and it's funny because that's kind of why we're sitting together and it's kind of why I think you believed in me is because I like I'm not afraid to tell you about Who I am or what I've been through and it's funny even more because my daughter just wrote that in her high school apology that pain is how we're all tethered together and I believe in it get him back to it I was definitely skeptical I've seen programs in prisons I've seen people who work in prisons and I didn't necessarily believe I did my fair share of research

[00:09:43] I listened to the entire podcast with Tim which was great I read about the program I went through their whole website I really read about you I but you know what I mean I'm like and I was like alright well let's see it was interesting because I was really hoping I didn't get let down mm-hmm but I was prepared for it and I wasn't let down at all so that's I was definitely a little skeptical because there's people there's programs and there's people that don't work and they're in place all over the place you know it's interesting you make the point about how I didn't know that you had said that to Devin that it was actually cats quote-unquote baggage that made her appealing and more trustworthy to you and

[00:10:29] I feel like in some ways one cat and I finally met that was a big part of the connection was you know I was going through a really difficult time she was going through a really difficult time and as you said sometimes pain just tethers people and it's you don't want to be around people who are gonna be very superficial and who we're just gonna tell you how great everything is and you want to be able to just let your guard down and sort of be yourself and I agree I think that that's such a big part of cat's efficacy now interestingly

[00:11:04] I think she was equally efficacious even before the PEP scandal and whatever year was 2009 or something but if anything all of the stuff that she's been through has only made her that much more grounded in what she's doing and the importance of second chances and third chances and all these things so I want to talk a lot more about what we experienced there because I found it to be one of the most important things I've ever done in my life and yet I've never really been able to talk about it since we left I've said very little about it too even the people

[00:11:36] I'm closest to because I don't know what to say have you been able to talk about it with anyone so a lot of people want to talk to me about it the closest people to me tell me that they're so happy that I found where I belong another guy told me put your flag in the ground your people need a leader like and really I mean like I get overwhelmed just thinking about it but I'm not overwhelmed in a bad way but in a really good way I've been able to talk about it but it's also I feel like I had a unique experience because of my history and I was able to see and watch you guys as well as watch the inmates and because I was skeptical so I was watching I've always been able to like watch and see what's going on rather than talk I feel like it's very helpful but yeah so I watched you guys have an experience and

[00:12:32] I watched the inmates have an experience and I meanwhile had a really powerful experience but I think it's easier probably to talk to people who have been there and done I thought that our drive back because we dropped Jason off back in Beverly Hills and then drove back to San Diego so we had like six hours together

[00:12:53] Haley Dan I found that to be one of the most incredible road trips of my life you know we listen to like the David Foster Wallace stuff as good it was just it was honor right yeah this is water and we just got into all of this stuff that made so much more sense to everyone once they'd been through that experience

[00:13:11] I just I found that six hours went by so quickly I was actually sad when we got to San Diego yeah it was over yeah I wasn't like in a rush to get home it was probably the easiest road trip I've ever taken for sure yeah comfortable yeah a lot of huge chocolate so yeah that didn't hurt so let's talk about your story I mean I don't actually know that much you've told me little bits but I've been deliberately not asking you too much leading up till today because I wanted to basically experience this as a listener would but all I basically knew when you showed up was you're Devon's buddy you'd serve time in prison that was it you had a good haircut yeah I'll tell you a little kind of joke so I spent eight seven years three months in ten days the last time I was in prison and in prison they give you single blade razors to shave your face and head with right and it's kind of a joke you end up with more cuts than clean shaves but I still use a two blade razor and everybody kind of bust my chops about it because they're like dude that you know you got seven blade yeah and they have batteries in them and and I joke because I'm like well you know like it's kind of the way

[00:14:30] I like to live I'm gonna work on the two for a couple years and then I'll go to the three I like why why we're out its welcome like it still has value to me yeah so I spent to kind of go back to the I've recently since we were together I kind of saw a lot more of the value that I have with what I've been through and kind of again with that tethering us together stuff right the way I see it is we all go about our business one of the things that got me through that prison term was two words endure and overcome and a lot of times that's kind of just like okay put your head down and keep moving your feet forward and we do that in life and we do that when we meet each other and we don't say hey like you know I've been hurt and so we're not able to like say that to the other person so we we don't get to connect unless we do that right and I'm able to do that and I don't know why and

[00:15:22] I think there's value in it so what I've been doing is going back through my own story to try to put something together in honesty to help Kat Hoke or to help people like Kat Hoke like the idea was to maybe put a book together and then take those funds to back something like that and also give those books to the guys in jail like just here like in jail everybody returns and no but you never see the guy who doesn't come back you never see him right and so it's all just negatively select and all you ever hear is all you know that I couldn't get a job and my parole officer sent me back and I you know my girlfriend and all you ever hear his excuses and really just traps and that's why I think those guys valued me is because they were like hold on you you just came here with these people and you were in here with us like

[00:16:16] I don't know how that math works and it's like well I'd love to show you you know what I mean so anyway I have a clear view of my like story but I grew up in a really nice home with like wonderful parents grew up in Buffalo yeah in Buffalo New York and I have like a lot of really good memories but my dad's an attorney my mom's an attorney working family I have an older brother who's five years older than me I have an older sister who's three years older than me and back then it was I don't know like middle America type life small city but we think we're big I played a ton of sports really athletic I think in some ways my dad favored that because I was like so into sports so me and my brother had like a big rivalry because he was like Star Wars and I was like let's play baseball or the more impactful stuff I think the stuff that led me down the road I was on was when I was I think seven years old and when you think about it's like a really young age right like I was seven years old and we were at a public or up minor league baseball game and we used to go to him was a family outing I was like a cheap family outing fun time and it was a cold day and the reason I remember it was cold was because nobody was using the bathroom like nobody was getting drunk and so nobody was in the bathroom and I me and my brother got up to use I was going to the bathroom he was going to get nachos and he must have been 12 at the time and I went to the bathroom by myself and some guy attacked me like there was nobody in there

[00:17:53] I don't want to get into like a ton of details in case I do sell the book somebody can look for it right but so some guy attacks me and basically steals all of my innocence all of my trust and like adults like looking back and I don't like to blame anything but now that I am looking back at this stuff it's like that guy really did a lot of damage to a kid and the funny thing about like psychology is up until I've done some work to kind of clean up my brain I didn't realize like the story

[00:18:28] I've been telling myself was different from the story that might like like in my story I screamed he ran and then I left the bathroom and like a cop came and they brought me to my parents and that's not how like in the real story like somebody found me in the bathroom was like blood on my neck and like choke marks and crying and sobbing and like brought and found my family you know I mean like it still hurts right like I was a 7 year old kid and it affected me in a lot of other ways so then like kind of fast like not even fast forward the next day or two days later and my mother tells me this now for like a couple weeks I would put like a shirt and tie on every morning to go to school and I would say well like maybe if I'm good like things won't happen to me and it's like well like she didn't do anything dude like it's not but so immediately like I

[00:19:24] I must have felt like it was my fault somehow and then you know I think they put me in therapy pretty quick they didn't know what to do my mother actually just were like gave me a poem that she wrote about it and it's like it was about lost like like I basically lost the little boy like that little boy was no longer on the planet like we went to a baseball game and we came home different people and that's you know it's crazy yeah so you went from basically being an innocent child to a wounded child and then eventually probably what people in that you know world of psychology would refer to as an adaptive child and then a lot of times you get sort of stunted there you don't become a functional adult so the adaptive child creates a bunch of behavior patterns that are effectively guaranteed to make sure you don't get hurt again yeah yeah I never heard the terms but I so when I was released from prison I went I like I hate to jump around too much but I went and saw somebody and we kind of worked that out and he was like and I actually went back to that same bathroom same place and sat in that same stall and was like like it was it was almost goofy because it was like nobody can hurt you like you're you're well-equipped and in the fact of the matter is like you don't even need to be like you're not a little boy like you don't need to and in your right like

[00:20:51] I lived my life kind of from then on in a way of like avoidance of situations that I didn't feel safe and or I mean I'm not so sure but I know that when I did the work later it was like attack before being attacked now when I get in like a playing soccer or something and some guy who's like drinking beers before the game screams obscenities or something like and okay I'll be like okay like I'll just kind of laugh and smile and nod and be like you have you have no idea and and I hope you go home and like are nice to your family have a nice evening so then what's amazing by the way about your story so far is that your parents were actually thoughtful enough to realize that this was a big deal

[00:21:37] I know that when a lot of people go through these these wounding events which again is how I sort of refer to these things is you know five types of wounding events that occur in childhood can basically if not completely dealt with alter the course of your life your parents are actually the exception in that they got it like right out of the gate and I don't think it's necessarily because of how educated they were a professional they were I mean I guess just they had good instincts but the tragedy is despite that it sounds like it it might not have been enough at the time so one of the questions I've been kind of asking myself a lot is like what what would have helped right exactly what could I have heard and in in that exploration so I've gotten I don't have a good answer yet and I'm gonna keep working on it but I know what I didn't feel like and I didn't feel valuable and

[00:22:35] I didn't feel I felt like something was wrong with me and and I think therapy kind of made it even more so because other kids weren't in therapy so it didn't make it easier unfortunately and I don't blame the therapists how long were you in therapy for I'm not really sure I just remember not liking it so it might have been a couple of years or less but it yeah by the time you were an adolescent you were sort of done with it yeah and and so like a lot of people that know me from then will call me it's not precocious mischievious right like so I was like Dennis the Menace I had literally had like white curly hair like wore overalls all the time which is funny because I like my favorite pair had like paint splatters on them and I paint houses now so it's like kind of goofy right but I don't know how long it was but it didn't like a lot of good people tried you know and I don't know what it would have took so I was like really mischievous so I think they were like well he's all right like he rides his bike he does tricks he gets hurt and he comes home like he's a he's okay and I think they probably in some ways wanted to believe that you know what I mean I would I would want to hope that like everything so then when I was 12 I was in Canada I was in Fort Erie we used to have a I have some really good memories of Crescent Beach I don't know if you've ever been to Crescent beaches in Fort Erie but this kid comes from down the street and says like nobody's around the parents are at work and my sister's like watching me but she's sunbathing on the beach and so my friend comes over and he says I forget the name of the hardware stores but I home hardware yeah yeah exactly this home art yeah and they had the slingshots they had like wrist rockets yeah yeah like serious yes so he was like listen I'm not I think you have to be 12 to get them and he was like I'm not old enough but you are I'm old but I don't look old and when none of us had obviously ID so he was like will you buy it for me and I said yeah like and so we buy this wrist rocket and it's it's kids stuff but it's stupid kid stuff so we get like a couple on the train tracks up there if you like dig underneath the stones there's like these hard or balls right and so we dig them up and we take a couple and there's a parking lot like a hundred yards away great like target practice right so we start hitting like cars and within I don't know an hour half an hour 15 minutes I was like a guy grabs me out of the window of this cottage and pulls me out of the window of the cottage who ends up being off-duty

[00:25:08] RCMP right so he's gonna arrest us he's waiting for his like though so we're getting arrested I'm 12 years old I have them like shirtless and my like swim trunks the pavements burning my feet like I remember that like looking up and being like oh man like what's going on you know like in my feet I remember like hopping back and forth with this like man holding me and so the guy arrests me they like we get in the car they handcuff us behind they put us both in the car and this guy punches me in the face right the officer well not the off-duty officer but the uniformed officer punches me in the face and I'm like I remember falling over but when you're handcuffed from behind you don't like falling naturally so you just kind of like topple like a top I mean that was impactful like I laugh about a lot of stuff but it was pretty impactful and just to kind of shine a better light on the RCMP s like

[00:26:04] I recently tried to go to Canada and I spent three hours at the border but it was the most pleasurable experience I've ever had with law enforcement mm-hmm and it was because of the Arabs RCMP so not all RC him he's our bad guys so that was like the next kind of big I got punished you know I probably couldn't go out of the house for like the summer or something I mean my parents were also disciplinarians they weren't like always just let him do whatever he wants but that was kind of the next thing and I think it was like my introduction my like harmless introduction to law enforcement I'm sort of struck by the random sequence of events that generally lead to one person going down one path or going down another I mean just hearing you tell your story for the first 12 years of your life i I've already sort of felt so many parallels to my life and it's really interesting I remember getting caught though it was not by law enforcement it was just a guy on the street when a bunch of my friends and I well one friend in my were basically hiding in bushes throwing rocks at cars passing by and pinging them and pinging and ping in them and then sure enough this one guy gets out of a car and comes and just shakes the [ __ ] out of us and like good for him because what he basically was screaming at is he's like you little shits like you're gonna give someone a heart attack doing this as an adult that seems ridiculous yeah as a kid it seemed like that was probably 10 or 11 and what's interesting is like you know your experience was probably a lot more traumatic because you just happened to get caught bad guy who was also a cop yeah you know and then on top of that you got the bad cop that shows up right and it's sort of like I don't know I mean again I'm not justifying your actions or my actions but in the end kids do a lot of dumb things and one of the things going back to Kern that there are a hundred things about that day that blew my mind but the saddest thing there that blew my mind was when we played the game step to the line which I want to talk about in more detail later then cat started playing the game of at what age did you have your first arrest and I couldn't believe how young some of these guys were when they were getting arrested in fact there was one gentleman there who has been basically incarcerated in one form another since he was 7 years old yeah I have a picture with him when he said that you know like

[00:28:33] I don't know I went and hugged him him and the other guy who had been in solitary confinement for over 12 years yep I know exactly what you're talking about because he was just diagonal to me and I don't want to say his name but yeah 7 I've probably mentioned that to five or six people since even this morning I talked about that guy 7 years old I mean he didn't put a gun in his hands right like if I recall he and his friend lit a fire and it killed someone right

[00:29:03] I'm not certain it was either somebody died you know it was either a firearm or like a fire but there were those two kids messing around yeah one of them or somebody died yeah he yeah he I mean he was an adult he and he he actually had a business running like he had put together a good on it it's just I mean it's like a sad state of affairs really so after this brush you're 12 you're now getting ready that you're in middle school you getting ready to enter high school yeah actually good preload because that's kind of when things right around then things got funky I mean I was a typical teenager in some ways girls like 12 13 years old like exploring that and exploring school and still playing sports yes still playing sports competitively too unlike a couple travel teams and stuff like that I was playing soccer and I mean it's irrelevant but he I was playing a good amount of sports but so the summer before high school me and one of my closest friends stumble across like his parents pot stash into this day to people who his mother actually just passed but the father I talked to all the time good man hard worker teacher smoked pot right but we found the pot and it was a lot like it was like a cool

[00:30:21] I don't know there's a lot of pot and so we took a hunk of it and [Music] I think we smoke that pot pretty much every day that summer and it was great you know we didn't have any responsibilities and and I was supposed to actually at the time I was supposed to go to this Catholic boy school or Jesuit or something boy school in Buffalo and play basketball there and that was like it was kind of set out for me and I was somewhat smart and I said to myself well

[00:30:50] I'm gonna stop smoking pot two weeks before school and then I said I'm gonna stop smoking pot one week before school and then I said you know I'm gonna stop pot the day yeah and then I was smoking pot on the porch of school right like and the next very impactful thing that happened to me and again could happen to anybody and it happened very like soon after that was I and this is in a weird way it's like as a man it's like oh yeah like I want to puff my chest out but like the fact of the matter is like I was a 13 year old child and so we got we got all stones for this school dance right and like thinking about how much pot we smoked is just like ridiculous like like boogers coming out of your nose from bong hits like you know just crazy right so like why would you ever want to do that but again that was it like I was a child so we get to this dance or on our way there

[00:31:47] I see it from another friend of mine who I played soccer with and he's like he's got like hash or so so we smoke some hash and I pull up to the school or whatever walk up to the school in my school and there's some girl crying outside of the school of course right there's always some girl crying outside right and of course like I'm like what do you need and she needed quarters to call her house cuz payphones so I give her these quarters I remember giving her like a fistful of quarters I don't know why I had a fistful of quarters and I don't know if my recollection is all that clear either but before I know we're like making out and the next thing

[00:32:23] I know we're having sex outside right now I'm a virgin but nobody knows that because when you're a 13 year old boy like you're not a virgin even if you're a virgin so everybody they let the dance out and we're outside on the lawn across the street behind a 4-foot picket fence or three foot picket fence and like I look up and at one moment I look up and I'm like wow this is fantastic like the stars are out it's a nice fall night and the next moment I like look up and there's literally like 30 people standing there like watching me have sex for the first time she gets up in like runs like I had a girlfriend at the time who was in the dance so then she's now she's like screaming at me and like and

[00:33:06] I you know I don't know what to say I'm pretty sure I said like well [ __ ] happens and like she like tried to hit me and that I left but like what makes it even worse and this is it's funny because this is the stuff I would like to keep out of stories but I think it's the stuff that's important to keep in the story so like we went out to dinner later like after that and I was I remember being like kind of in my own shell at that point like what like what's like trying what you and which girl no no so me and like my buddies oh we have to like yeah well we all went out to pizza and I'm sure I was like some kind of hero but like I remember feeling alone not like you know like a sad emotional way but I remember feeling like something happened and I need to figure it out I remember going to the bathroom and realizing that I had blood all over me and then being like really embarrassed but also really confused because I didn't know liked it was that because of was that because of whatever right and then being like well that's like awful gross and like so now like my whole sexual identities again kind of screwy right it's like this is unusual and then straight after that the principal of the school or the Dean of

[00:34:20] Students or something told me that I needed to tell my parents what happened and if I didn't tell them in three days or something that he was going to tell them and I just couldn't I didn't know how to say I still envy people who can like I see them like mom my kids found my pot you know my friend did that in front of me to his mom and his mouths like you're a jerk like what you know but I remember thinking and this is only a couple years ago like like you could tell her that like like how do you I don't understand how you I quit a job when I got up it was like a somewhat good job it was like I was driving with the Union driving cement mixers and I didn't tell my dad for two weeks and we're close like we we jog together every week like

[00:35:04] I still have a hard time with it so anyway and I think my solution because of my history and feeling different and wondering why like a lot of like I constantly wondered why me like what what's what's wrong with me that this is like that I get caught that I get punched that I get attacked that you know what I mean and not to like throw blame at the world but I just didn't understand I didn't understand chance I didn't understand any of it so I try to commit suicide and it's it's interesting to me because when we were in the church during that three-day window right on the last day I started drinking I like I stole some liquor from my parents cabinet I took probably like half a bottle or a whole bottle of Tylenol which we talked about in the car and is a lethal dose of Tylenol and I almost died I was in the hospital I mean my recollection is something like 5 to 7 days but I was in the hospital for a while because they couldn't pump it out of me because it was already like in my liver and I mean you're a doctor yeah you got lucky if they couldn't get it out with the activated charcoal or the

[00:36:11] NAC and it's sort of a watch and wait and about half the people I gotta have to know your exact dose but more than half the people probably would have gone into liver failure and the only thing that saves them is a liver transplant well I remember once taking care of a woman she was probably 27 and I remember that she was absolutely stunning and beautiful and I guess she had broken up her boyfriend maybe had broken up with her and she took a whole bottle of

[00:36:38] Tylenol and by the time we got her in the ICU I was in the surgical ICU at the time and she came to the surgical ICU from the ER because we basically it was clear that her liver was gonna bonk and she was gonna need a liver transplant and we sort of had a three-day window to get her a liver transplant and interestingly she was certainly cognizant enough of what was going on to realize what was happening and fortunately we were if she was lucky enough to be one of the ones that got a transplant and God I remember just being so sad for her as we took care of her after that transplant because you could just sort of sense the pain that she must have been going through to go that far even though yes you could say well maybe that was quite impulsive in the moment but yeah it's impulsive but it's still I mean it's a very deliberate thing to do and a cry for help presumably which I mean I'm guessing at this point your parents have figured out something is going on yeah you know so you said you're lucky and and I know I mean as I sit in here in front of you I have like I've had two brain surgeries

[00:37:49] I've had the interesting part of that is is it's like what which list do you look at right and it's kind of something I say to people and to myself all the time like which list are you looking at I think we might have talked about that too like do you have a car with a catch check engine light on oh you have a car that's great like that's that's so much better than and so now it's kind of sitting here I kind of realized that I have the answer to the question why me today but I also know that I was very lucky throughout all of it and maybe not luck is the word right like so maybe it all plays out for a reason and I'm alive and strong today to deliver a message I don't know you know I know that I was lucky then I remember I drank charcoal for three or four days I remember one of the things I remember still is my dad carrying me to like get washed up because I was weak I was like really really weak I remember having to take what he call it like blood tests mm-hmm periodically like every couple days when

[00:38:58] I got out of the hospital because they wanted to check I think liver enzymes and I had to see a psychologist and I had to see the police and things honestly and like an all honesty things really just deteriorated from that point on I mean I was already at the like probably beginning stages of addiction addiction like any type of substance I don't think I did anything other than small and drink alcohol but they take you out of yourself right you don't solve problems through drug use and and I found that to be like helpful and so that's kind of the direction I went after that you know my parents I think tried they put me in countless they tried a lot of things I mean this to me is you know sort of something I can talk about for hours because it's such an interesting topic as far as the relationship between trauma and addiction I mean it is such a strong relationship which is not to say it's a one-to-one mapping I'm sure there are some people out there who have addictions who have never experienced trauma and there are certainly people out there who've experienced trauma that do not develop addictions but I've learned a lot over the last couple of years about this and one of the things

[00:40:10] I've learned is the addictions that we tend to think of which are substance addictions are one thing but there are many people who are addicted but it doesn't involve a substance like alcohol nicotine you know narcotics sex gambling you start to get away from the substances into these more process rated related addictions and one of the things

[00:40:33] I certainly am familiar with both maybe personally but also professionally is just you know people who are addicted to work people who are addicted to perfectionism people who are addicted to control and there's a great book called in the realm of hungry ghosts written by a guy named Gabor mate' who is a psychiatrist in Vancouver kind of working on you know a part of Vancouver that sort of sees a lot of inner-city drug use and he's talked about this extensively right which is even from a neurobiological standpoint most of us somehow numb pain with these different things and what's not entirely clear to me is you know why one person might have a genetic predisposition to find alcohol to be sufficiently numbing or a drug of choice to be sufficiently numbing whereas another person might find stimulation from you know gambling or sex or something to be the thing that completely bathes that part of their brain and dopamine but I remember when I went into trauma based meant one of the things that just amazed me was you know you have a roommate right so you've got I'm rooming with someone who to this day is now still one of my very close friends and I remember when I showed up it was like I was so pissed off I didn't want to be there I didn't want to be around anybody I certainly didn't want to have a roommate yeah I was like I'll pay extra if I can not have a roommate right yeah and then you realize man you know even though he and I had very different paths in life or at least on the surface it looked that way actually we're very similar similar injuries similar responses it's just when one person is addicted to work and the other person's addicted to alcohol and cocaine society will tend to reward one over the other but doesn't necessarily mean that that person's healthier yeah when we were in the car one of the things that struck me about you was your focus right longevity and that one of the things you had said was geared towards not not any specific like I don't want a pigeonhole what you said but it was really impactful because it was like well he kind of need the whole picture like it's just not health like

[00:42:44] Reich health or health isn't just exercising this and you know it's like you need emotional stability you need balance right it's almost like a ghost balance today you know it's like and that's what addiction is it's like I'm gonna put my head down to solve everything and kind of soldier forward but everything else kind of gets lost in the dust you know did you have any issues with anger when you were growing up did that and the reason I asked is like going back to the the exposures that I've had to this topic I mean it's what we got a lot of ambulances going by here today yes that's the that's the beauty of doing the recording in New

[00:43:24] York City here is you've got basically you can classify wounds into these five things which are in the ways that I were never heard yeah so it's basically like there's a trauma tree okay okay so that the roots of the tree are the five things that are tend to be traumatic so the first of them is abuse abuse can be physical sexual emotional spiritual the next one is abandonment the next one is neglect and then something called n mesh meant which is when parents kind of treat kids like little adults so this is a an obviously oversimplification or a simple example but you'll see this a lot with a single parent raising a child and then basically confides in that child as though they're the partner my I've seen it yeah you know seven year-olds who are having to hear about mommy's sex life or something like that or her problems with her boyfriend or something like that and then the the fifth one is witnessing a tragic event so something that even if you weren't a part of it but just witnessing something completely horrific like 9/11 right to have seen that would have been devastating so these roots of the tree basically create shame and then that shame if not dealt with appropriately as an adult to manifest itself typically in about these four branches that we sort of think about one of them is addiction which again very broad definition here this can be substance addiction process addiction etc codependency attachment disorders and habituated survival strategies and embedded within that is like dysregulated emotion right so anger emotional volatility you know all of these other things and so you know again just kind of even listening to your story in my mind I'm sort of thinking about your tree right okay which is obviously you suffer two dies right but what I think most people don't realize is when it comes to children abuse and neglect or abandonment always go hand in hand you might not think of it that way because you had loving parents but the reality of it is as a seven-year-old child you are supposed to be protected by your parents at all times now I'm not faulting your parents at all for the fact that they didn't have the foresight maybe to say we should escort

[00:45:28] Corey to the bathroom but the reality of it is and because no parent can do that you can't protect your kids 24/7 but the problem is when a child gets injured there's an emotional response that says look we're we're mommy and daddy like someone's supposed to protect me at this point I initially had a very hard time accepting some of that stuff on a personal level and I'll tell you one of the most interesting and powerful things a therapist said to me was picture your children at the age that you were at when you had the experiences you had and now imagine how much you're willing to not minimize the effect when it's not you thinking about yourself so in other words you imagine your daughter as a seven year old and that having happened to her and then contrast your reaction to that with your reaction to how you treated it when it was yourself which was that you know [ __ ] happens yeah you know I got a bum rap that day but yeah hey life moves on you wouldn't be feeling that way if it was your daughter what's the difference yeah the difference is it's it's a lot easier to minimize when it's you yeah get you through it you know it gets you through for sure so what happened after you got out of the hospital so you're at you're in your first year of high school now first year of high school I never even showed up for the tryouts for the basketball team and then I wondered why they didn't just come find me I really I really was like that what a bum like what a bum rap like why didn't they come get me like that I thought it was that good and so they asked me to leave shortly after leave that high school and

[00:46:59] I had gotten an I mean I did I did goofy stuff too like there was a bookie in the school but I knew that he was the actual money and that you know he said oh you know I I get the bets from this old Italian guy don't mess with him but I and he's like these kids had a lot of money some of these kids so some of them old like five hundred a thousand dollars so I said well just give me half and

[00:47:20] I'll make sure you don't have to pay like I was doing that kind of stuff and selling pot and you know I was like pretty popular I got along well with the girls and stuff and that all that became way more important to me than like pleasing my parents or teachers or anybody really I stopped going to practices I stopped playing sports how did your parents react to that I think my father's kind of stoic guy as I've been writing this book I mentioned talking about some of this stuff to him and he said well everything's good no like why don't we you know and I don't blame him for that like I wouldn't necessarily want to dredge any of that stuff up and so my dad I think at the time didn't know what to do my dad's kind of the long-term response at the time the one thing he settled in on was like if you follow certain rules then you'll always have like a space in my home and in you know you'll always be my son and I'll always love you but you can't live in my home if you sell drugs and don't go to school mm-hmm and my mom my mom was my mom took on like a tougher tougher love my mom thought I think my grandmother had mental illness so my mom thought I had mental on this and I did something I got drunk and I got into a fight and pretty much a blackout but I came home with my

[00:48:40] I split open like you know and I was screaming and yelling so there's your anger stuff right like I mean I would do that yeah by you you know like all that kids stuff which is really terrible but they brought me to a I don't know what it's called like a child psychiatric unit for like they talked to a therapist and it putting me like getting me in there but for a week maybe or two weeks I think it was the amount of time I was supposed to stay there and that was a real eye-opener and that you're what 15 16 14 well yeah 14 years old so one of the common terms that you hear from my parents is out of control and what that's led me to believe like from their perspective that they just didn't have any control and they didn't know what to do and you know like I have a stepson who's 11 and and he has he's a great kid loves the kid he's like really cool but he has some issues with handling emotions he doesn't like and so I know what like loss of control feels like and I know what like sitting up late and trying to figure out ways to help guide feel like - and when I say out of control I mean like I would one time I said I was punished couldn't leave the house and I said I'm gonna take the dog for a walk tied the dog to the porch and left for two weeks at 14 and like out of control like out of control my dad still will joke to this day if I threw your brother out of the house he'd sit on the porch until midnight and drag his trunk back in at midnight you know he'd go down with this big trunk and and if I threw you out you'd leave with a stick and a sandwich and I'd down the street you'd

[00:50:23] March like you know like I cool see you when I get hungry your siblings are both older right I guess by the time you're 14 they're almost out of the house so me and my sister have been talking a lot I mean we me and my sister have always been close my sister I guess slept in the crib with me when I was a baby me and my brother always fought I don't think me and my brother got along until I was 25 and I think maybe a lot of that may have been because he wasn't the athletic son in the beginning like there was like differences there and then I think I probably in some ways blamed him or maybe my parents may have blamed him or maybe he felt like he should have been there for me on that day at the baseball right and then we fought like coward like we would there was times when my parents were like one of you has to be like you can't be in the same house together without an adult so around that time he was really unhappy with me because looking at it like an adult like they lost a lot of attention all right my parents had to deal with me so much more because and they couldn't you know make it to all their games because they were getting cory out of school or taking cory to therapy or but my sister and i stayed really close and a lot of [ __ ] started to happen when she went away to college and she still to this day kind of feels like i wanted to come and save you but I'm glad you're about 15 when she goes to college right

[00:51:49] I think so yeah 14 15 I was born in October she was born in March so it's like it gets a little goofy I know I mean yeah those last three years of high school like when now both your siblings are out of the house right so I go from child psychiatric unit I get out I talk my way out and there was like a wedge between my parents because my mom wanted to medicate my dad didn't shortly after that I was like stealing my grandfather's car he was senile the keys were in our house so I would take the car I got arrested in the car like joyriding and I was I was given the option to go to a juvenile rehab as opposed to going to jail and I had been

[00:52:27] I had been in detention centers a few times too so then I go to this child rehab and it wasn't a bad place like I actually spend it decent amount of time talking to the kids who are in that same rehab now and I ran away from it after like two months and it's it one of the interesting things kind of a time lapse story is I was sitting at a table with a bunch of these kids one day and one of them was giving me all these reasons why he wanted to go home I want to see my girlfriend I want good food I miss my family and I literally heard myself saying all those exactly like I'm sure it's happened to you but I heard it playback and me saying that and then I remembered what did I do that day and I couldn't see it I was blind to it then but the first thing I did I had like $10 in my pocket the first thing I did was go to a corner store get a 40 ounce beer and a pack of cigarettes and I drank the beer and then I went looking for my friends and the pizza and everything else and as an adult sitting with those kids it was like cheese like really it was it was like addiction back then even that was the first thing you went to mm-hmm so I ended up going back my parents talked him into letting me back in and not getting arrested and I went back to the rehab and I almost finished it and I broke into a teacher's desk to steal the answers for somebody else right so that was like one of those things I saved I was just trying to help somebody you know in my head like why I was a good guy so they asked me to leave and I left and at that point my parents had split up while I was in the rehab and that was pretty impactful too because the way they did it was kind of terrible and

[00:54:10] I'll joke with them to this day like they sat down on either side of me my mother said we have something to tell you my dad cried for like the second time in my life and was like your mother doesn't love me anymore you know since I what the [ __ ] like pardon me and there's a 16 year old it's funny because you like I laugh about it now but as a 16 year old I really went hold on so you don't love him but you've known him longer than you know me how do you just do that so so all those times you've told me you love me so anybody can walk away at any time right mm-hmm so there's your abandonment right like [Music] so I got out and I kind of bounce back and forth with parents and lived on the streets and a friend of Mines mother took me in I love this woman to this day she has five sons one of them was here in New York now he's like massively successful as an interior designer big shout out to Sammy but their mother still says the Rosary for me every morning right so there's your look how am i lucky I just saw her last week and she said it but you know I she had one rule cuz she had five sons no girls in my house like you can pretty much do anything I mean this woman went to work every day and she would come home in her uniform make dinner for five boys six boys clean the whole house and fall asleep in her she delivers the mail in her uniform and get up and go to work right like but she said she cried and said like I need you to go you keep bringing girls in my house I think we had a girl in the Attic for like three days or something that her father came I was a mess and then I ended up in the clutches of like a predator 15 or 16 something like the right around there and this happened to be a friend of

[00:55:51] Mines father right so I I mean he was like the cool dad you know like he was like he had been to prison and he was like all you can stay with me and like my son will stay there too and it I don't even like to talk about it right but he I remember I still hadn't done any real drugs just alcohol and tobacco and one night we were all playing cards and my friend went to bed and he says he ever do cocaine and no and he's do you want to it like kind of yeah sure and so he like within a few weeks he had me selling cocaine and like a bar I had dropped out of any schooling I was in you know he gave me the keys to the car he gave me a day job in his deli I mean it only last so long for an adult to like work a job and sell drugs at night and you know and then I was 16 so within a short period of time I was like really worn out and really sick and then you know like he one night it was just me and him and then like I said it was like a really comfortable situation he had made it that way and then it wasn't and it was really really uncomfortable but I had nowhere to go at this point and I had no none of my own money or anything because it's kind of like this is an ugly term but it's kind of like pimping somebody it's like here's everything you need in life but none of its yours right as soon as you walk out the door you're done and I think people do that in relationships and whatever else so there was nights there was a lot of nights where I was like sixteen and we'd go out drinking and we'd be looking for girls but I knew what he was like hoping for and I would just be like I'm staying out and so it before five six and I'd be walking around the street until I thought he'd be asleep and then I found out that like creepy dudes are on the street too you know like I remember the first time if you've never like walked the street as a teenager late I'd like early in the morning type stuff like you wouldn't know this but creepy dads and minivans will ask you where the party is right and like the first time I was like oh there's like a party don't you know and I didn't know like what the neat like looking back at the dude was probably like you [ __ ] idiot like but in those situations I had the courage to tell somebody like get the [ __ ] away from me but in a closed room in a house like I didn't and and that affected me beyond measure like it's just sort of amazing to me this the consistency in this idea that predators have like a sixth sense for wounded kids they have like wounded child antennae if you remember any of the sort of details from the the

[00:58:26] Catholic Church scandal I mean the one theme that was relatively consistent there because there was the ubiquity of the priests that were molesting these kids was unprecedented but it's like they always managed to pick the kid that didn't have a dad or that was living in a broken home or who there was always some problem and it's it's really it makes it that much more infuriating they've got like this discernment they can look at a person and realize that this is a person that could be exploited you give them something attention typically yeah it could be money it could be something like that you give them something that they are missing and then you can exploit them and it's it's such a it's so so painful to watch yeah you know the more I've like explored it and and to be honest with you I've never

[00:59:13] I've talked to one other person to at this point in my life about that kind stuff but again I think the more I can show the more I can help and so that's like and the reality of the situation is I think the more I let down any guards I have the more I can let people in and the more I can let people and the richer

[00:59:34] I'll be in people and that's all I really give a [ __ ] about at this point in my life and so that's why I'm doing it but I've also realized that these people do what they do very intentionally you know and then they do know what they're doing like there's a plan behind it and it's I'm still like not the person you want to put in a room with a pedophile

[00:59:56] I mean like you'll see the worst of me I would imagine my father prosecuted pedophiles for some time and when I was waiting to go to prison he would tell me like which guy like hey did you see such-and-such and I'd be like no but when I do and then I'd be in solitary for like beating them up I just don't have the stomach I don't know children are such like gifts and so vulnerable and I think like I especially in my with my history I I just can't see like anybody hurting kids it's just you do so much damage you know you break into somebody's house and he's still a sense of self security right but like if you if you like hurt a child like each steal kind of their life the life they could have had I suppose right yeah I mean I think that's what basically happens is you you take a kid who's seven and you you wound them severely enough that's when their childhood stops so whatever comes after that is not a normal childhood it's like I said it's this adoptive childhood at best so this adaptive childhood basically takes over when in reality you should be able to enter functional adolescence functional adulthood there's a lot of sadness there right and that was probably one of the last like major it's funny but I sat down with a therapist when I got out of prison to like work out some more demons right and do you do a timeline yeah and he was like Jesus Christ he was like dude your life is like trauma after trauma after trauma so that wasn't the last thing but like the real like the meat of this is like in a lot of ways like turning it around right like that's why we met like I mean the fact that I'm but how did you and

[01:01:40] Darden prison so no I'm not gonna like skip everything so at 19 so that was terrible I got away from that I like turn the shower on one day while my friend was there while his father was there and I walked out and I never went back and I like I hated myself for that too because again that was my fault right like I didn't stop any of it I'd like I continued to be there it wasn't your fault well no no I know that but in that you're you're sort of telling yourself at the drag that's your narrative so another thing that's kind of important is the only person I was listening to was me right and I created this narrative that was and one of the reasons I really believe in cat

[01:02:18] Hoke and her programs is because it's about changing the narrative and sometimes it's not as simple as that but that's one of the major things like what list are you reading from right and so at 19 this is like another kind of trauma I was at a and I'll be frank like I went to a high school hockey game with a bunch of my friends to fight some people some people had jumped one of my friends he was in their neighborhood they were coming to our neighborhood for this hockey game none of them showed up so we were there spectators watching one of our friends play a game after the game most likely provoked the opposing team came out in front of the rink and started hitting one of my friends with sticks with their hockey sticks right and I don't remember anything from this point on and I still don't but I was actually just with somebody that does and there's newspaper articles about it but we all ran back to help I ended up with seven I think fractures in my skull three in my face broken orbital blown and no bleeding like external bleeding right so my head was swelling like rapidly nobody knew what was wrong I wanted to go home I didn't know where home was and here's like the what list are you reading stuff my flight here I flew next to the cousin of the doctor who saved my life what she sat with me so this doctor rushes in to the emergency room and at

[01:03:47] Buffalo ECMC Hospital Erie County Medical Center and he's like the MacGyver of brain surgery right he gets there he bust me today I don't have ID on me he says I don't give a [ __ ] like the kid's gonna [ __ ] die drill a hole in his head so he gets going he saves my life does two brain surgeries I walk out ten days later he was pretty surprised right and on the way here I'm chatting like the lady next to me hey why you going to New York and like all right like I'll give why do you have those huge scars on your head yeah well I think she's in private practice as a drug counselor so we started like you know we hit it off I was like I'm going to talk about this experience I had with this guy and and she's like oh wow you know like that's what I do in

[01:04:30] Buffalo like I work with drug addicts and this and I was like all cool and I was like yeah you know what long story short that's the story that I look for today right that's the stuff that I'm like oh okay there's my light bulb right so she like I was able to tell her hey tell your cousin I wrote him a letter probably six years ago and sent it to the hospital like thanking him but I was like tell him that like my daughter set to graduate next week I'm flying in New York I own a business site like I have employees who love me and come over for Christmas like and it's because he saved my life that night you know that's like my days my days are filled with this kind of like wow stuff man they really are right it's no [ __ ] and it's it's like oh you should write a story like that it is like the whole thing is kind of an ongoing crazy [ __ ] story so I had this brain surgery for a while I remembered I was in a coma and I remembered the coma for a while and it was like I was back I was back in that home with that abuse with that guy at 16 and I couldn't get out of the hospital but like I couldn't get out and my father took me in after that he was like you're gonna come live with me and you're gonna get your GED and your license before you get any stupider I remember I'm saying like those words and

[01:05:53] I did and I got my GED you know that's generally equivalency I remember I scored like almost perfect and everybody was like you're such an [ __ ] like why like why couldn't have just gone like you just had two brain surgeries and you get this a great score like what did they do fix you but I also remember very vividly walking out of the house with all my friends and my dad looking like really sad and upset like he was gonna lose you again and I he was we went to a cemetery and smoke pot right and I remember that and I remember going to a bar and I still had like a stocking cap from the for the staples you know because I still had staples in my head so I couldn't have been home more than what three would how long do they take him up a week yes so I I was in a bar in a club with staples and probably cuz I thought it'd look real cool right like a like the white DMX of the time right so so I remember some girl like grabbing my head and be like oh my god you're alive right and like what the [ __ ] it like I still have staples in my head and now I look at it I'm like what an idiot like what were you like why not just get a little rest dude you didn't even have a job to go to but shortly after that I started to get in real legal trouble I got a couple thousand dollars from a settlement I was such a jerk that I like actually went to court and said I didn't like see anybody do it which I didn't right but like I had to be like you know but this was the sort of Street ethic yeah and honestly up until then I didn't have a violent street like people used to joke and be like yeah surfer Corey cuz I like really just wanted to like smoke pot have a good time and not think about how I hated myself right and after that it was definitely if you like if I think you're gonna hurt me I'm and are at you first because the reality is I literally almost died and it was by the hands of other people and it was intentional right and so I think I got like ten thousand dollars and I bought a couch a BMW and some cocaine and I was like set I was ready to take over

[01:08:00] Buffalo and I think I got arrested seven times that year and each arrest has its own sad story and its own kind of just kind of depravity and like maybe someday we'll will talk about all those but like well at least save that one for the book right yeah the saddest part about it was two things one was it always smelled like urine and kind of bumps right jails and I would wake up in the morning and I would know where I was because of the feel of the bench on my back before I opened my eyes and I wouldn't know why I was there and that was terrifying and I was like 19 maybe 20 and it was like what's happening obviously like it when we talked about out of control at 14 like this is like I don't control this anymore and the other thing was I woke up in my bed one morning and it smelled like the jail and I know that it wasn't the jail anymore right so it smelled like urine and you know throw up and I was like what like old alcohol and I was like well it's not your roommate you know it's like if this is you and those are two kind of impactful things from that time and then kind of jumping forward to 22 I had just turned 22 and I was selling a lot of drugs I was kind of uh in my own head I was like somewhat of like a big-shot we sold a ton of pot we had a lot of guns too and our house got raided but I wasn't in it and my roommate at the time kind of took the fall he went as far as to say everything in the house is mine and the stuff that like Corey doesn't even live here he just his name's on the lease because like when his girlfriend throws him out and so he was actually I like a lot of Buffalo cops I'll say that in case anybody ever hears this but some of them screwed up and they put the wrong number apartment on the warrant so the whole thing fell through and like they let my friend go but they found 13 guns in the house like things were now obviously way out of control but I still had this weird set of ethics and I would only I would only harm people that were in that life I started robbing drug dealers so like guys would come over and be like I got mushrooms and I'm homeless you have and they'd be like 10 pounds and I'd be like I'll take it all and then I would just take it and kind of by hook or by crook right so

[01:10:25] I grew up with lawyers and politicians and stuff so I like knew how to be sneaky is [ __ ] so I would do these sneaky things and I would also do it by like force I rob these guys who happened to be like a weird working for a terrorist so and buffalo and my father was like livid cuz he was like these guys were monitored like you robbed like their weed branch you idiot like they're gonna and they did they tried to kill me they stabbed me with a screwdriver like 30 guys I had a sneaker mark on my face for a week and a half like I got beat up really bad and then I robbed a guy because he was dating my girlfriend and

[01:11:06] I robbed him for some cocaine he was like dating my my mother and my daughter and I even say anything about my daughter because at that time it was like everything else right and so I had a daughter when I had the brain surgery my girlfriend was pregnant with her there's just so much in there it's like so much was happening I mean I ruptured my stomach at one point and got cleaned for a while and went to a homeless shelter for kids on my own and like there was a lot of like clean periods in there too and there was like a lot of trying and when I got the end of that like trauma and this kind of shitty story it was like if I don't play the game I can't lose alright so I stopped at the point that I ended up going to prison I had stopped trying my daughter's Godfather we sat down on a bar porch and he said like what are you doing like this isn't who you was before you went to prison right and he was like like why are you behaving like this and

[01:12:03] I said dude like I'm tired of trying to be good and failing at it and and I leave a lot of stuff up and I don't do it intentionally but like I had tried I'm trying to like get to like the the meteor stuff right so yeah I had I had a two-year-old daughter who lived with me at that time that I went to jail seven times in one year and her mother you know she would leave and then I talked

[01:12:27] I'd get sober and clean and but without any type of help just kind of on my own and I'd stop selling drugs and I go to work and she'd move back in and that like eventually we'd have some type of fight and she'd move out and then I get crazy again and were you still in touch with your parents much I mean your dad obviously you mentioned he was at least in the loop when you robbed the weed arm of the terror cell and your parents of course are at this point now divorced are you closer to your dad than your mom at this point so I almost don't talk to my mom at all the only reason from 16 to like 19 I barely speak to my mom at all she said when I worked at that bus terminals like selling coke that I would call her once in a while be like somebody needs legal helpful you talk to them and like put them on the phone and

[01:13:14] I think probably subconsciously I just wanted a like hear her voice and hope she would be like are you okay can I come get you but me and my dad I was definitely a big disappointment and my dad's kind of all by the way that's such an interesting point cuz you're telling that story I'm trying to imagine being your mom because listening to everything you're saying it's like I think a listener will put themselves in your shoes put themselves and your parents shoes put them in you know whatever and in that moment I was thinking about your mom I was thinking about being your mom and how frustrating that would be to get that call and it's so interesting to hear you say that all you wanted was to hear her voice and hope that she would say are you okay can

[01:13:53] I come and get you and as I'm thinking about it from your mom's point of view I'm thinking how pissed would I be in this situation like and I realize like oh my god that's that's the problem right it's like I wouldn't think at that moment to be vulnerable to put my guard down to put my feelings away and say how can I help you even for your own even for your child yeah because look it's and I'm saying this trying to be empathetic to the pain your parents are going through which is what the hell happened here you know because they with the best of intentions they probably cannot figure out at this point that this all goes back to what happened to a seven-year-old boy in a bathroom yeah and I don't I mean obvious and I'm not saying that either to say that that but now that I've become highly obsessed with this topic and and these stories and this is kind of like all I read these days like I mean I mean I read scientific papers in the day but the evenings are basically reading about trauma and addiction and all of this stuff and your story is such a poignant example of that I mean it's an extreme example let's be honest I mean most people fortunately will not go through 1/10 of the trauma you have experienced to date in their entire lifetimes but that doesn't mean that the trauma that they're going through doesn also dramatically alter the way they interact with the world as adults and I don't know I mean there was this movie once with what was it called geez somehow like the movie was basically about doing history over and over again like you could redo life but you could see like how one small change would lead to a dramatic change right and it's like when

[01:15:34] I hear these horrible stories and you know I think back to the stories of the people that I know when I was going through these sort of recovery paths you always had those moments where like almost everybody had this inflection point where something really really bad happened and it doesn't have to be bad or you know as we used to tribe it you got capital T trauma and small T trauma ok you have a lot of big T traumas but sometimes it's just an accumulation of little T traumas that sort of bend somebody but these big t traumas they they are the ones that sometimes have these profound effects in a relatively short period of time and I don't know it's just it's really I think it's just sad I get sad for you but I get sad not that that's you know the purpose of the exercise but but I guess that for your parents too because I can't imagine how helpless they'd feel watching someone who they loved unconditionally self-destruct yeah as a parent myself now and then like as a step parent you know I think about that stuff a lot and

[01:16:35] I like deal with a lot of people who are addicted and like who one guy I was trying to help I like hung himself and it was because he didn't want to quit his job to go to rehab and my son lives with me and I got to pay the rent and I said look we'll figure that out but you're gonna die you know and he's like no any hung himself it's like but like for your child you know like

[01:16:57] I'm so so lucky so blessed that my daughter is on her own a very amazing young woman like on her and when I say on her own like she she was the driving force of any success she's had in her life how old was she when you went to prison for that long Stan yeah so she she was three and so I was up until then

[01:17:23] I was like a dad but I wasn't a good dad in any you know like I would her mother worked in the mornings and so I would take I was with her every morning which was great and like I have some really cool men like we had tea time you know so I wasn't like I think of a lot of this stuff and I wondered why people would still like come see me in jail and write me and like all this stuff and it was because I wasn't a terrible person right and as we learned in Kern a maximum-security prison

[01:17:51] I didn't meet too many terrible people there either no no right yeah correct so she was three when I went to prison impactful things about that were like I spent a lot of time with her before that it wasn't it was obviously not caring about myself but she told me I robbed this guy he was a drug dealer he told me was gonna kill me he actually like it sounds stupid but he like set me up he paid somebody to put me in a car and bring me to a place and like unbeknownst to me he called me a bunch of times told me he's gonna kill me I told him like really frankly a number of times like please leave me alone like I have a gun in my pocket I'll shoot you and he'll go to the hospital and I'll go to jail and like I just a terrible way to end the day and that's what happened like he pulled up he jumped out I jumped out and

[01:18:45] I shot him in the chest he ran away I ran away later that night I called a friend of mine he told me to turn myself in I did and I was December 21st 2003 and Christmas I called my father's house my daughter was there and I remember very vividly him saying McKenzie do you want to talk to your father and her saying no he'll be here and thinking no right meanwhile she just wrote her like acceptance letter to college based on that like experience like starts with that experience I said she knew how to grab people I think then the next one was I called one day and she said I thought you were never gonna leave and she was for maybe right and it was true like I had told her that and I had meant it you know thankfully so I got sentenced to eight and a half years in prison first shooting a guy first salt like pled guilty to assault when you shot him did you I mean do you think he was gonna die maybe what were you were you thinking like I'm I want to make sure he does not die but he gets the message I mean was there any know the reason I asked this by the way is when I was at that Hopkins I mean yeah it was a very busy trauma center and so I think the numbers back then were more probably 16 penetrating traumas a day on average 16 gunshot or knife wound a day on average it's probably less today but probably not much less call it 10 a day even but what you realize is 95% of it is drug-related but what I couldn't believe was the ubiquity of death I mean I just couldn't believe how many people could kill each other and of course it's quite random like you know the bullet you know

[01:20:30] I see guys that came in that were shot 16 times that would live clearly that guy wasn't intended to live no and then you see guys that get like this one random shot that like happens to cross their pelvis and that's the one that kills them because it hits like their iliac vein and you know that's an almost lethal injury and yeah yeah like we'd get guys with single gunshot wounds to the chest that got so lucky you know like they'd be out of the hospital in three days this guy again medical like medical miracle they said I think I don't know because it wasn't any of my business to know but I think it bounced off his sternum and deflected down but like right in front of his heart never reached terminal velocity of if you had been 2 inches to the left of the sternum if you know a bullet going through the heart is a lethal injury there are lots of other ways to kill somebody shooting him in the chest but there's another example of like you could you could add up the ledger of all the things that went against you and then all the times the wind was at your back yeah in a lot of times in the same instance yeah exactly you know that gets even crazier too like how that played out but that continues to happen did you know you had hit effectively your rock bottom at that point like when did the gravity of that situation I wish I had believe it or not so I didn't screw my head on straight the next day no no I get it but did you

[01:21:57] I guess what I'm asking is because it doesn't mean that you can I was relieved you were relieved to go to prison yeah I knew that this was gonna end like what was happening was gonna end a major change was gonna like happen think about how sad that is it's terrible think about how sad it is I didn't realize that that the idea that you could finally go someplace where there's structure you're probably safer inside than you were outside a lot less choices yeah I wasn't gonna like he can't you can't continually disappoint people if you're already like a I joke today but

[01:22:30] I'm like people have such low expectations of me because I'm an ex-felon that like I say please and thank you and they're like what a [ __ ] gentleman he is yeah you got it let's eat up when he pees I was amazed in the same right yeah so yes sentenced to eight and a half years and it wasn't the end like I slept for two weeks when I first got there I spent were your parents with you when you were sentenced yes so here's a real kind of funny one my parents were with me the whole time this first one's not funny my mother came to see me and like it like the amazing mother she is she said this is what she says to me I think the first time she visits me in jail after I shot somebody okay honey you need to start thinking about what you're gonna do when you get out of here and how you're gonna put the pieces together and to her credit she didn't slap me because I said mom the sooner you realize that this is

[01:23:21] Who I am that I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna Rob people and I'm gonna go back to jail and I'm gonna do drugs and this is my life the sooner you'll feel better about this and I'm sure I I think she probably just said oh okay honey basically you're not there yet but we'll work on it you know and like came back with a good attitude the next time and that's what I believed and that's that self-talk and that's that [ __ ] like you know like it's my fault I stayed I you know and that's what Kat Hoch in that program that's what Kern that's a big part of their curriculum it's like now let's turn that around like maybe there was some things you did but like what are we gonna do now right and so they were both there with me both of them are attorneys my father was a prosecutor for 30 40 years my MA was a defense attorney right my mom was like a hippie my dad's like a just kind of straight shooter he's not a politician he's not he's just kind of a good guy right they get this fantastic lawyer obviously he does it for free like one of buffalos best lawyers is like no I'm gonna do it for you guys because you're good people or whatever and he gets me this deal for eight and a half years so they pull me in and I have to agree to it and I'm like okay but it's like I agreed to this on the spot right like trials what was the alternative so tri pled to assault pled to sock plead guilty to assault I was charged I see you're gonna be charged with attempted murder attempted murder assault and possession of a weapon and there was a 50-50 chance that I could have won because I had brain damage because he came after me because there was a call record because there was witnesses however I still had a gun in my pocket like I got up that morning and put a gun in my pocket so even if I did win at trial I'm gonna still be found guilty of having a firearm and intending to use it and that carries a minimum of like seven years or something like that it was like if even if I win and I get the best possible outcome at seven years right so it was like okay or possibly more so they they work out a deal you know like backroom deal like eight and a half years in like it is and keep in mind another thing that we saw at Kern which is how many of those guys would have never had the opportunity you even had there right right yeah you know like a good lawyer I wouldn't have a good lawyer they wouldn't hurt the parents there they wouldn't have had somebody looking out for their best interest and that's how those guys are going to like those guys end up on a path to life in prison oh yeah yeah it's it's they need like an advocate right so my mom my mom says take the deal my dad says no and that's kind of a funny story it's like so here's like the two people I probably respect the most on the planet they're split yeah and they're split debt like to come on like an agree hole in the back room and argue and come out with a unified answer yeah like and the funny thing is like as far as advice and intelligence and stuff like not that my I don't think my mom smart boy I feel like my mom's emotional and I feel like my dad can separate himself from that better and make more informed decisions

[01:26:25] I went against them I was like nah because in this instance and this is kind of indicative of my father and mines relationship he was like no like you're special like you're not supposed to get eight and a half years like you're somebody supposed to come in at this point and say he's a good kid give him five or something you know and I could see it in his eyes and I was like I'm taking this deal so I did and you know I went downhill in there for a couple years like I still had some it was what happened your first night in there the first night or like first night in prison or first night in jail my first night in prison first night in you when you when it's all like the worst day I think I had it was repeatedly was like the first day because they have us being in New York state presidents called the draft and they they pack you up they tell you they say mr. Richie you're on the draft pack all your stuff up you'll be going on a bus tomorrow and you have no idea where and every time I mean like prison is like a new high school right and so new cool kids new cool kids new bad kids new good kids new you know teachers to impress new you know what I mean like the whole thing but with like knives and you know what I mean in heroin instead of like pot so it's like okay this is serious business like there's like there's a bunch of first nights because you you go through a real dehumanizing process of the whole shaves ahead thing the whole naked shower thing like that's real like it's not [ __ ] and then you don't you have like one pair of pants one pair of underwear and you have no idea where you're going then you go to another jail and you stay there for like two months until you end up at the place you're gonna go and I had the place I was gonna go was a

[01:28:04] Supermax Correctional Facility in New York and it was it looks like a spaceship from the inside looked a lot like not like current because it's only there's one hallway that connects everything mm-hmm but it looked like a like a spaceship in some ways man that's like this huge bubble and this one big really big like Aryan type looking dude

[01:28:25] I could see it and he was like yeah you [ __ ] up because I was just like kind of stuff like why'd I did like what what's the like what's happening you know dragging like a potato sack of my clothes and he was like yeah you [ __ ] up dude and I was just like I mean I don't know if I was like terrified but I was just like what's around the corner like gotta be aware yeah do you remember the first night there at your ultimate destination no you have a roommate yeah so me yes I'm a coach coach was a piece of [ __ ] he'll be here is that yeah and he was actually a good guy to me then but he was high he was like a pedophile that was hiding and like told this great story about how he had like smashed some guy with an ashtray because he tried to rob a restaurant but he ended up in jail for it because he hurt him so bad and he was the next military guy and he was the coach of football and and it really he was like a coach because he had no kids and he was a creep right but how did guys tell their story in there because if you're a pedophile I'm guessing you don't want to advertise that at all no so they typically hide and they they hide in different things they hide they hide in religion all right like the

[01:29:45] Catholic Church kind of thing or like a black pedophile would most likely be like in a religion like a black or a religion like a Muslim right like in jail that's how things are kind of segregated unfortunately but and then like the chaplains like assistant is most likely a pedophile who spends all this time with like the

[01:30:05] Chaplin trying to reform his soul or whatever but they tell a story you know they come up with a story everybody's got their story right and in jail it's kind of like Facebook nobody knows you from home you know like what's the chance that you're gonna see your buddy from like Ontario Street you know like really I mean like so like everybody's got their own like no I didn't steal purses I was like I was like a car thief for the Albanian mob like no okay but you don't have any cigarettes like all right like sir you need to borrow a stamp like it's kind of a common joke like oh yeah you need to borrow a stamp but you are kingpin status in this now it's [ __ ] so how did you navigate those seven years I mean I know that it would take us another seven hours to get through probably everything you went through emotionally and probably physically and spiritually for that matter but what's the general arc sounds like it went down before it went up it did I was reading a journal on the flight here of when I got clean in jail like I kept a journal off and on for the whole time and I have them on they're kind of interesting sometimes frightening to read but first you know continued drug use this is my sound like a naive question because I remember being surprised to see how much drug use there was in prison but given how much can be controlled in prison I was sort of surprised at how easy it was to get drugs in there a lot of it comes in through like visits a lot of states I guess don't have like contact visits what they call contact visits where you can kiss and hug and stuff but a lot of stuff comes in from guards too like one of my buddies who's successfully released from parole a couple weeks ago in Rochester New York I still talk to all the time he had a kitchen worker a civilian they call them bringing em in drugs for money because it's it's what's the best currency in prison because cash does cash have a lot of value none cash has no value really because you can't do

[01:32:08] I mean you got to get it out it's like a job you know cigarettes cartons of cigarettes the comb crates stamps and like books to stand like a hundred stamps there's a lot of gambling in prison like football gambling and stuff like that and they use stamps and then you can send money to somebody's family loved one whatever so that's that's the real currency beyond like inside there's people that are selling like a good amount of heroin or now it's probably suboxone and stuff like that in prison and that's what they do you know send your girlfriends gonna send my girlfriend $150 ten times right yeah yeah that's the drugs yeah so it went down like I was in and out of solitary a bunch of times for like I you know I didn't have a lot of problems in jail a lot of I think the scars on my head and like I don't know what it was but a lot of guys didn't give me a lot of trouble and that was I'm grateful for them I'm really grateful for do you have to or did you feel pressured to become affiliated relating the gangs presumably they would have loved you in the Aryan

[01:33:16] Brotherhood yeah I hated those guys so here's a it's kind of a goofy so I'm in this jail called Elmira correctional facility it's one of the New York state correctional facilities real old Shawshank Redemption II know it's like the big kind of corridor forty four cells long yeah I can paint you the picture but unless he's seen like a movie like yeah so so they have a porter that like delivers food and brings you water to like wash your body with and stuff like that and and the one of them was a guy named Leroy Brown I remember because they write a song yeah and he was big and he was black and he was but he was cool as a fan too but he said and then the other one was like this Aryan dude right and and he was like big and bald and white and so the Aryan dude sells me three cigarettes for three stamps but he never brings me the cigarettes but I gave him the stamps so

[01:34:06] I'm thinking I got eight years to do like I can't allow this to happen right and this was my attitude so this is kind of how I got through the first four years and so they opened the doors for Chow or whatever and we're all supposed to come out in that line and line up and I go running to where he is and just jump on him like a rabid I was probably like 150 pounds to write like I have stretch marks from pull-ups because I was so skinny when I got to jail and I'm not a big guy right so I like jump on this guy and like start attacking him and the cops come and they pulled me off and like Leroy comes to my cell later he's like to put them like what the [ __ ] is like why would you do that and I was like he played me for three stamps like he and Levi kind of I kind of gave you the cigarettes to like you didn't have to do all that crazy [ __ ] and I remember telling him like nah man I got eight years to do like I can't and so ever since then I really didn't like a lot of those I don't like gangs are really an ugly ugly it's it's more pimps it's more pimps of hurt people and the other thing that's really impactful is a lot of the people that were in those detention centers with me when I was a kid and stuff are all in jail right they're just her kids man and gang leaders are pimps they sign kids up who are scared and afraid and don't have anything and they tell you we'll give you stuff we'll give you somebody to talk to we'll be your friends will walk around with you and then honestly what most of them do is they get drugs from somebody else like the leader will get the drugs and then they'll tell the kid you got to go cut that guy he's a snitch and if you don't cut him we're gonna cut you it's like what the [ __ ] like why are you I was amazed at how often I heard that story all the time right we were together when we got to Kern remember how they said the day before we got there I was a huge attack on the guards complete lockdown was a couple of guys that were a day away from getting out yeah like they were working in the front of like yeah yeah I'm secure pie right they could have walked out and they probably got hurt but like and I remember talking to the warden and saying you know like I sort of naive idiot I'm like I don't understand how a guy who's been in jail for 15 years there's three days away from getting out would attack the guards which 'men you know the only explanation is the guy doesn't want to leave prison and he's like yeah or the other explanation is he was basically told he had to do this or he was gonna die or yeah exactly where someone he cared about was gonna die and it's like they just didn't want to let their gang member go you know what just hit me as you were saying that it's like if because it didn't make sense to my mom either right and it didn't make sense to my dad and it doesn't make sense to people like so if it doesn't make some sense like instead of getting mad something's wrong you know so like one of the things that like may help is like what's wrong or you know and that said a lot but like what can I do I know something's wrong you know because because if it doesn't make sense it's obvious like something is wrong here like you don't that's it's so unnatural of an act to hurt yourself in that way right to stay in the environment to hurt somebody that's gonna give you more time and that's just know so during the first four years your daughter basically is going from the ages of three to seven yeah how often did you get to see her again thankful to my parents I got to see her every month and I think one of the major reasons that I started to turn things around or one of the things that was most impactful to me as I was I was calling her every Wednesday and my she would go to my father's house every

[01:37:41] Wednesday night and I would call home and I would talk to her every Wednesday and every time this kid how long were you allowed to talk 30 minutes about I mean I could call back again and and thankful today now in today's prison system it's so overrun with gangs that a non-affiliated guy has a hard time even using a phone ever like just you can't like unless you're you know back at the prison where you spent the majority of your time what percentage of guys would be unaffiliated a lot here's a funny thing so since 14 to 25 25 is after the first four years of my incarceration I didn't live in one place for more than six months right including prison like they moved me from prison to prison because I was acting up every six months or eight months maybe you know I didn't stay in any place for long and my daughter what was impactful to me was that somebody would hand me drugs on a

[01:38:37] Wednesday afternoon and I would forget to call her and the thing is with with me I don't know about anybody else but I wanted to be a good dad right and I wanted to be a good son and I wanted to be a good brother but when it came time to choose those things it didn't a choice between one or the other it just became like well I I had I've come up with a list of reasons why I should and why it was okay and a lot of times I would it was momentarily it was like somebody say hey here's 25 of these right and I'd say okay give them to me and I'd eat them all and then I'd be coming back from the yard at 10 o'clock at night and I passed the phones and I'd realize I hadn't called and then I went to solitaire and

[01:39:22] I wrote my father and said can you tell her the phones are broken and he said no I'm done lying to her for you like if you want to lie to her you can lie to her and I couldn't how long were you in solitaire the first time every time other than 130 days and I think it was probably like six times one time was 48 days or something we met these guys who had been in solitary for years at a time including one guy who I think had spent 12 or 13 years in solitary and he was only thirty years old he was only thirty

[01:39:51] Anna yeah what's solitary like I mean first of all what are the dimensions I mean what are the rules of engagement in all honesty I think the worst part about solitaire for me was getting there so you're kind of like marched through a compound or through a prison handcuffed and you're not treated like kindly or softly in any way right like you're a threat at this point you're you know you're handcuffed behind your back and your arms are up and probably rightfully so right but when you get there the odd thing to me is it's like reminiscent of the abuses that I've suffered over my life because it's a very very tight rope to walk like you're in a room with probably five guards they're all gassed up and you have to take your clothes off like piece by piece while you're facing a wall and it's directions like take your left sock off with your right hand which in that instance become very charged right and it's like Jesus Christ I hope I don't do this with the wrong hand and if you do like your head goes off a wall and then you're like and then you're on the ground and then you're back up and then you're trying to do it again and like it's like somebody slapping you in the head telling you answer a question answer the question like and so for me that was like really difficult I just like I said I think it brought me back to like abuse when I was a kid but being in the cell wasn't the worst thing for me how big is the soul she's maybe 8 by 10 6 by 10 something like that it wasn't I don't know it was big enough that you could be on a bunk which had to be at least six feet because I'm six feet right so probably seven feet long maybe five feet wide so you couldn't put your arms out in the width of the cell in one or two I had been in one where I couldn't and that was in Buffalo that was like a an extra special solitary room really and you're in there 23 hours a day yeah most of the time too I mean like if it's in New York your rec is outside so you'd be a damn fool to go out the funny thing is if you go out if you ask to go in Iraq in the winter they get mad and they leave you out there for two hours and like literally you're jumping jacks like you're doing jumping jacks just uh just to stay warm but like you don't have enough calories and you to be doing jumping jacks to stay warm either the food was an issue but like I read a lot

[01:42:14] I probably read a thousand books or more when I was in prison I don't know I'd say more I just read and read and read and the thing is when I read these journals to like even in those first couple years I was trying to be better but I wasn't deducting that like okay to be better maybe you need to subtract the drugs and alcohol like that just can't be an option anymore like maybe you've abused that right and so interesting that you say that my brother is also a prosecutor and he has a couple of boys he's always toyed with writing an article called everything I learned about the criminals I prosecute I learned from my son's because he's like basically like we're all kind of born as criminals were born right yeah yeah like we're you know we have to learn you know once we develop a prefrontal cortex we have to learn the boundaries and the rules and things like that and so I was telling him this story about my older son who's like almost four and he's uh you know if he were an adult he'd be a sociopath but you know he's just a he's a he's a cute little four-year-old who's problematic I was talking with a grocery store the other day just to get him out of the house and I mean he's just he's like such a little dick sometimes you know I mean like I know he goes and bites apples and he takes one bite of an apple and throws it takes one bite Apple throws it and it's like I'm like Reese yeah I know I need like and he takes this shopping cart and rams it into other people and he's just like it ended the day like you can't even take the kid grocery shop so

[01:43:41] I'm that the part that I told my brother that made me think of what you just said as I said you know the funniest thing that Reese says is sometimes I'll sit him down and I'm like buddy why are you being so bad and he's like I want to and then other times I'll say Reese why don't you just try to be good man and he's like I don't want to yeah so then there are other times like when I'm putting him to bed and he's in a better space and I'll be like ricci man it was a tough day today buddy he's a tough day hey man you really created a lot of problems do you think tomorrow could be a better day and he's like and he he'll cry and it just breaks your heart he goes he goes daddy I want to be good I just don't know how to and I like I thought of you my second ago with what you said it's like you want it to be good I mean you didn't want this you didn't want to be sitting in solitary confinement and I want to not be able to call my like let this girl down like like you got to be able to do better than that but I didn't know yeah I mean that to me is like part of this mystery of this cycle of shame because all that trauma is long behind you but now what you're dealing with is just the complete morass of shame that has engulfed you and I had owned it at that point it wasn't even it was like you're just a I used to say like I feel like I'm born bad and that's all there is to like it wasn't a feeling anymore was the truth yeah and I'm sure that biologists will debate it forever and sociologists and criminologist or whatever I'm not sure I buy that people are born bad maybe but I I think Occam's razor well I don't know what Occam's razor would say here maybe it would say that there's enough random permutations that some people are just born bad but I

[01:45:25] I have a hard time believing that I think that there are lots of bad people out there there's no doubt about are people who something bad happens and they just go down a path and they're unrecoverable errors but I think that more quote unquote bad people more those guys that we were meeting yeah I mean I don't I didn't get the sense any of them wanted to be bad I got the sense that a lot of them wanted what you wanted none of those guys until death I was in there had the playbook right or the beliefs like so my parole officer came to my house when I had been released from prison and we we got a good rapport and and he said Cory why do you think like nobody makes it and I said because there's like a fear of failure and a lack of hope and then those don't aren't like factual things and they fluctuate there's more to it obviously than that but like when you are in that position and you don't like I don't I don't want to be a failure either like I all right

[01:46:24] I'm a loser fine but like let me be a good loser like we're people like I got my own TV time in jail like all right well and I got cigarettes and nobody [ __ ] with me yeah I'm at least and so these guys they go there and like one of the guys we were with he he was the warden had talked to us about him and he was like like a mastermind in jail selling drugs right and so in here he's like I think it's it's hard to even understand the risk he's taking by taking himself out of what he's like a master at right and saying like okay I'm gonna try this other thing even though I don't believe it right and like everyday telling himself that there's a possibility that this could be real for me there's a possibility yeah and I think as you said

[01:47:07] I like the way you described it which is defy gives these guys a playbook I was gonna say it much less eloquently which is the guys know what the objective is I don't want to be here and I want to live a better life but they don't have the strategy or the tactics to do it because why would you I mean if you had the strategy in the tactics the probability that you'd be there in the first place is probably quite low and so I mean I do take some comfort in knowing that perhaps one of the most well it might be one of the only major bipartisan things that seems to be relatively uniformly agreed to on the right in the left is criminal justice reform yeah whether you come at it from the standpoint of social justice or fiscal responsibility nobody wins there you can take the case for anybody winning in this situation that makes sense so what turns you around four years into this so it'd be silly to say that one thing did just like one thing didn't get you in there no and you know I spend a lot of time thinking about this too and it was a culmination of a bunch of things there was this one guy from Queens this crazy guy he was like a biker from Queens and he always say you don't have to live like this right but and you'd be like come to the AAA meetings and I believe this [ __ ] nut like leave me alone you weirdo and he was a cool guy but then there was a southern kid who was could have been me another white kid who had just finished doing eight years and was back to do five and he was telling me how happy he was with his life and he would walk by the mirror and when he was home right and he'd feel good and look good and then he went out and he had a drink and then he had two drinks and then he did some coke and then he knew he was gonna go back to jail and all he had to do was stop and he couldn't stop any committed a crime and he ended up back for five years and then there was this girl who I had given mouth-to-mouth to when I was like 15 or 16 who had like overdosed from coke she she came to visit me out of the blue and she had brought me like an a a book and she was like here and I'd like used it as like to prop my bed up you know and she'd she came like continuously like every six months eight months she would be like hey how are you how you doing and her life was like she was like selling insurance in Maine and had like her picture on the side of buses and she's like pretty right she's like a really pretty girl I was like how the [ __ ] did you end up in Maine selling insurance and I ended up in here and she was like well I stopped doing drugs dude and she came to see you yeah and that's huge right like and made it a habit to when I wasn't listening even more right like if you're listening it's like all I'm selling something and they're buying it but like selling green piece on the street in New York is like a hard sell and she was doing that and you know and I wasn't I wasn't able to call what I should be calling and I could see it and my life wasn't getting any better and I could see that like

[01:49:57] I was putting this thing or these things in front of the growth that I really wanted right I'm reading all the right books I was reading like Carlos Castaneda and The Four Agreements and all this stuff and it wasn't sticking why isn't it sticking like because you're still hurting yourself and you don't believe that like you can be different so those two girls came I'm like here here you go with like the stories they came on the same day that some guys were coming to bring me some drugs the girl who was coming to give me like this message of like hope and stuff and she comes with another girl who I grew up with and who I'm still friends with to this day and they didn't like like you got to get clean you got to get sober you got to go to like AAA and you got to pray and like they didn't do any of this they just loved me and they were like add like we're not selling ourselves isn't that great like and I was like wow like good for you you know like and they were like dude you look like you're kind of like torn and I was like yeah I'm afraid and they're like what are you afraid of and I was like

[01:50:50] I'm afraid that this is the rest of my life that in and out of here the sad I just kind of want to not go to visits anymore I just want to hide in here and never and they were like dude if you don't drink you like in do drugs like you won't come back here like you're a good guy you're just buried and [ __ ] and like I think I bought it for like a minute and it happened to be Father's

[01:51:11] Day and it happened to be 11 years ago and I haven't since then had a drink or a drug and that I think has like in a lot of ways allowed me to save my life and allow me to receive a lot of help from other people and so I started doing like real work like I have i was reading the journals on the way here but i like started reading rereading some of those books and like thinking how can i apply these to my life and like in those journals there's stuff like okay like i had like an outburst today and how can I see that outburst coming like not in the moment but days ahead right like how does my attitude shift before I punch somebody in the face or challenge a guard to a fight like and it was real it was like okay like you start complaining about your circumstances instead of appreciating your circumstances right like and and then very soon like it's okay to do these things right whereas if you appreciate your life that's not and and obviously had bad days and I had a ton of support right like I went to a halfway house upon release I worked with counselors in jail I went to solitary like clean and sober to like I still I thought it was like okay to like steal from the commissary I think I had you guys about that Ellie we're like embezzling funds while we're in jail yeah I had lessons to learn I still think that like I had I not been in there for the like first four years of my change that I did that change may or may not have happened like we talked about like one thing can kind of switch the course of the life and I needed to get like really grounded in who I thought I was and I think one of the biggest things Peter and I was talking to this guy this morning about it in

[01:52:53] Queens was that I had to stop caring about what other people thought so much I would I learned to do like some yoga and some stretches and some meditation stuff from books right and I would get up at 5:00 a.m. to do it cuz nobody else was up in this guy I knew got up one morning and he like made a noise as he went by like of shame and I jumped in my bed like I was seven like I jumped in the bed and like put the covers and I was like what the [ __ ] why am i afraid to be good right like why am i afraid to like take care of myself right like I have to be tough like [ __ ] dumb like and the funny thing is that the less tough I am like today dealing with these guys in jail like I told one of the guys in jail about like some of these abuses right and and he was like the minute I told he was like dude thank you like at me too right but like I can't tell anybody that because like we're bad we're supposed to be bad and tough and defensive and but anyway I had to like learn to love to like fight for myself when I was going through some stuff I was in a place where we had to you know go to a 12-step meeting every single night so even if you weren't you know they were all open meetings so you'd go even if you weren't to if you weren't an alcoholic you'd still go to the AAA meeting or the NA meeting or the

[01:54:11] SA meeting or all those things but you know the part of the country we were in which is super rural I mean I saw things I just couldn't imagine and I gotta tell you I never said a single word at any of these meetings you know but I I took something so powerful from it I was so moved by some of the the things that people admitted to in terms of like awful things that had happened to them in awful things that they had done and that you know I know that people are quite critical of 12-step programs and I don't I mean again I think part of it comes down to like assuming that one solution works for everybody and that's just you know obviously Peyton Lee incorrect in any walk of life addiction shouldn't be an exception to that but there actually is something quite powerful about that process and I have many patients who maybe there's some of the most successful people I've ever met they'll still spend four days a week going to their meeting you know whether it's na al-anon a lot of them they'll go and they'll say you know I haven't spoken in four years but that's you know for me it's it's not about being the smartest guy in the room it's about being grounded in the struggle I have like mixed emotions about 12-step programs but I generally like the steps and so like the old school minnow down or whatever steps are like admit fault clean house and help others right that's like the the old school like one two three and and it's funny because in defies like in the podcast where they with Tim Ferriss and Kath Hulk they got through some of the actual curriculum and a lot of that curriculum is stuff that's in different 12-step programs right it's like taking like saying hey I can't handle this first right and then saying I need some help and then saying like I believe that I can receive that help and change this and then saying okay what's my fault mm-hmm and then saying here's the things I've done am I really that bad and then saying how can

[01:56:17] I fix those things and then saying okay I need to take an inventory and then how can I help other people and that's fantastic but I think once you put a name on anything it gets a little yeah I think I guess I think once people become so anchored - maybe every single rule every single religion about it once it becomes a religion it becomes problematic really but the interesting but but it's sort of like I'm I've you on these things is you've got to take a Bruce Lee approach so you know if you know if you understood how well how Bruce Lee created jeet kune do-- he said look every martial art boxing wrestling all these fighting forms each of them has something to offer and each of them has things that are utterly useless and will get you killed in a street fight

[01:56:58] I want to absorb what is useful discard what is useless and create this perfect thing jeet kune do-- and in many ways what you might extract from AAA might be different than what I would extract from it but I do think that there is value in these steps and you just articulated it you know really well yeah it's it's kind of the the interesting thing and like I said I've kind of got mixed emotions about it because I I still go to AAA on a fairly regular basis but the interesting thing is I all ask myself because I don't want to ever get stuck in one thing right and I always want to stay open-minded and like I said I think it allowed me this time and space to extract one thing from the mixture and then learn how to handle life again a gave me a curriculum whereas I didn't have a curriculum like the guys at defy do and gave me a playbook for getting morals back right like you shouldn't lie you know I was like okay well that could get me in trouble and then don't do the things that'll make you feel uncomfortable or to lie you know and like get you in trouble and again like there's once it becomes a religion it's like there's a lot of interesting or just you know to say it plainly like weird and kind of creepy [ __ ] in a a and a si right there's people in those places that are looking to sell drugs over so I asked myself why am I here and there's there's like one group I go to that's like like a straight up tribe of really cool men right like good men and I love going to see these guys like 7:15 and the funny thing is it's like in a it's in a temple like a Jewish temple and it's like there's a group of guys that in the morning and we all kind of joke and it's good you know there's like good people there we all help each other in life around the community everything but then I go because I like I like the humility of the situation right I like to realize that I've been there and I can go there some really important things for me in life are like gratitude right like gratitude and humility and then like there's a really good group of people that I can help and I have the capabilities of trying to help and for me again like the values there like the value and my life is there like money is good but I've been really really broke and ate like noodles like college kids for years and years and like I don't really give a [ __ ] as long as I can I don't look at prices of food thankfully these days but like I don't have to worry about a lot of stuff so if I can help people with my spare time other than my own family like all right cool

[01:59:36] I'll go find some guys that like have the same issues as me and and that's a great place for it but again it I'm not an allegiance kind of guy like I don't pledge allegiance to anything you know so how long before you were released did you find out you were gonna be released because it sounds like you got a lot got out a little earlier than you were I did

[01:59:55] I got seven years have you impressed me with your intelligence and your like memory but I just I I it's funny you know I was a math major so I was able to go eight and a half - seven and a quarter yeah and know that that was like a number bigger than one that's all yeah but you remembered it from an hour or so ago but so you get determinate and indeterminate sentences right and like an indeterminant is three to six right or one to three and then a determinate is a set sentence but in New York State you can do 85% of your time unless you don't satisfy certain requirements and get into trouble and I happen to satisfy those requirements and all the trouble I got into wasn't serious enough to take any of that time but I think they were still possibly gonna take some of that time which was kind of nerve-wracking I remember I had to go like see somebody to make sure that gonna give me that time and that was nerve-racking because like I didn't want to tell my daughter yeah Sutter expectations I don't know yeah when you have that hearing where they said yep we're gonna commute your sentence to 85% how long from that moment until you are out the door probably three months three months six months it's the longest probably three months 90 days so was there any period of time in there when you were actually afraid to get out terrified yeah like I almost sabotage I got I was playing soccer and it was a perfect storm like some guy was picking on some kid and like slammed him into the bleachers and like heard I'm pretty bad so you can win on both counts because you can still honor your code of being good but still get what you want which is you know a longer sentence it's like still it's crazy because it's like my girlfriend jokes like it's my fantasy to like catch the bad guy like that's beating up like some kid or girl and it's so it's so obvious based on what happened to you right like when you look back okay it's a Hodel sense right it's like you want to go back and catch that guy you want to catch that [ __ ] before he does it yeah you want to be there to protect the 7 year old you yeah I joke around about like wanting to like beating somebody up but like that's why when I was growing up there was a really really famous case a guy called the

[02:02:18] Scarborough rapist his name is Paul Bernardo eventually taught but he ended up living about three streets over from me I went to the same grade school and everything like that he was several years old or I'd obviously didn't know him but he really terrorized Scarborough which was the borough of Toronto I grew up in and eventually you know he and his wife got caught after they'd killed three girls including his wife sister being one of them I mean it was a the most ridiculous fucked-up situation in the world and you know certainly one of the most infamous cases in Canadian legal history for reasons I won't get into actually but during the sort of four years when he was at large as the Scarborough rapist you know a lot of these assaults took place really near where I lived and I actually only admitted what I'm about to say now for the first time about six months ago in a sort of group setting because it didn't make sense before and now it kind of made sense but on Friday nights after

[02:03:18] I'd come home from boxing or martial arts like I would dress up as a girl and go running in this park hoping that he would attack me so I could like you know get the back yeah so you could yeah and I remember telling the story to like my roommate and and he was like he couldn't believe it and I was sort of telling it like it's not a normal thing to do wouldn't anybody do that like on a Friday night and he's make sense to me yeah yeah yeah you're looking over there going yeah yeah that's a good idea he's looking at me like that that doesn't make any sense but I but I get it I mean I understand what you're saying and so how did you fight the urge on that day to not go and correct the unfortunately I really didn't like I yelled at him I knocked him over right so he knocked him to kill the other guy over I knocked him over and then I yelled at I'm like what are you gonna do like you're not gonna do anything and he didn't and then the next day I was like worried cuz this is prison and like you know heard he goes hurt people so I was like oh [ __ ] like so I had some people I know talk to him and tell him like just don't go near him like don't even go near Korey and thankfully it I like he didn't and I didn't have to worry about it but really it was like preparation is what ease the fear you don't like getting busy kind of like you said earlier about addictions or whatever but like getting busy doing the work to secure yourself I think helped a lot but there's I just picked up a guy the other day devs little brother and and one of the things that connected us like he has this huge smile on his face right sweet kid named

[02:04:53] Edgar nice guy 24 years old big guy but he's got to smile on his face and this kind of like glow like it like a father that just had a like a baby coming out of a hospital but if you look deep enough in his eyes he's like scared sure and I said it to him and he was like oh yeah that's right you know that's another example just by admitting it to him it's now he can talk about it yeah so I was afraid and there's not a lot you can do I was afraid when I after I got out I went to I went to a halfway house six months like and I didn't want to go there either I had a laundry list of reasons why I should go get laid and stay with some girls or whatever and that was just stupid and so and it was like well you don't know how to live really dude so you need somebody you know what I mean and it was that like simple admission and so I went there and

[02:05:40] I stayed there but I was terrified remember like being terrified that when when score are you gonna come home and the other thing that I gotta mention is when I first started like going to these meetings or doing this yoga or doing all these kind of like explorative Noomi type stuff whatever you want to call it right there would always be talk self-talk that followed like what are you [ __ ] doing like dude stop like you're you're a like feeling feeling like you're an imposter or yeah and like like you're wasting time why are you entertaining yeah exactly you can't change you're like you're a [ __ ] just admit it like all you're gonna do is hurt everybody again don't line it up like this just [ __ ] get high the narrative right oh my god dude it like I it's why I like cradle like new guys to this because it's like dude like I know you're your biggest enemy right now like all this [ __ ] that like and they'll be they'll look at me again and they'll be like how the [ __ ] do you know that you know like how do you know that I just told myself why are you talking to this [ __ ] weirdo because you want to succeed that's why I asked so like you because you'd want a better life you know what I mean but like it was terrible and it was terrible then and I got out and I was terrified and it was like you're like when's Corey coming home I kept looking for me so what about that day you went to the this is one of the four stories that I remember you telling that day is your first day out out out you know you got a report to the parole officer the next morning at 8 o'clock in the morning what happens so really again with the this is that kind of duality situation the wind at my back in the in the crazy situations right so I my mother picks me up and kind of show you the time she had a bunch of CDs like brought CDs like what do you want to listen to right so she brings me to Buffalo and the first thing I have to do is check in with parole like I'm here I'm in Buffalo so

[02:07:32] Goo Goo Dolls yeah yes that's the first CD I was the Goo Goo Dolls on a 4th of July in front of the jail they did a big concert in front of the jail fourth of July no way and I'd like watch the fireworks and listen to it yeah 2004 maybe or three so we go to parole and I walk in and I have to check in and the way parole works is your parole officer works on a specific day whether that's the day you got out or not you still have to go there right you may not see your parole officer but you're gonna see a parole officer and they're gonna give you stipulations they're gonna give you a day in time to come so I check in with his parole officer and he's like a large athletic built black guy right and

[02:08:15] I'm looking at him and and not the situation you want to stare anybody in the face right like and I'm staring him right in the face and he's like like well he gives me this look and he's like like what's up dude and I'm like I'm sorry man like I don't know you just looked familiar not the thing you want to say to your parole officer - right like yeah I know you yeah I visited your daughter before like just not where you want to be but I don't know why I'm like stepping out my tongue either right and because something else was pushing me forward right that wind at my back and he he looks at me and he's like well would you play sports and I was like yeah but I've been in jail for eight years so like I like I don't know how I would know you from sports and he was like hold on like

[02:08:54] Cory McCarthy and I'm like yeah like oh [ __ ] Kelly like Funderburk so it's he worked in that childhood rehab right he brought us to a a and n meanings he like he this dude actually taught me a lot about hygiene as a 16 year old kid right like or a 15 or 14 year old kid right I remember that he's like because there was some dirty kids and he brought us all in a room and he like taught us all about hygiene and how to be like hygienic and he's still bringing kids to meetings from that childhood rehab but he he looked me in the face and he was like oh man and it was funny cuz he says all right so I guess you relapsed on something well a little bit you know and he said he said dude as long as you as long as you stay clean this [ __ ] will be a breeze like you won't have any problem and not everybody like going back not everybody gets that day right that's nobody's day really like that doesn't happen to everybody where it's a familiar face and he's kind and he says like you can do this right I mean then I went to breakfast with my mother and then I picked my daughter from school for the first time ever and then we was 10 years old 11 yeah she was 11 years old and you know were you able to keep it together no I mean no I wrote her school a lot too four copies of her report cards and to see how she was doing and to see what I could do if anything and it was really embarrassing but at the same time it was like well like you got to try anything right so like I knew some of the people that were teachers there and like one of her favorite teachers was that woman who says the rosary Fermi's sister and like

[02:10:34] I mean that's Buffalo - right but small-town stuff but yeah I wanted to take her to school [ __ ] you know six years ago and I never could so no I wasn't able to keep it together but she was happy you know and she wasn't afraid or nervous she may have been nervous that's her story that's all yeah but that was those I mean that was pretty much my first day and I checked in at the halfway house and I remember I couldn't sleep on a bed I couldn't sleep on a bed for a couple of months because it was too soft like a mattress was too soft felt like I was falling all night every time I turned so I slept on the floor how long probably three months it was just more comfortable are there any other habits that have kind of stayed with you or anything absolute ease so that fear when I got arrested when I was 12 I continuously cracked every bone in my body in the cell like my wrists mine my knuckles my neck my knees my ankles and I still crack my neck kind of repetitively and I think that's from that and I also how I battled that fear was I talked to some people about it they told me it was normal they told me it'd be more abnormal if I didn't have that fear but then they also told me well like you've been home a couple months and you were in jail everything was going well liked wanting to just keep doing those things and so today I still do pull-ups dips and push-ups on a regular basis I still run on a regular basis I still get up in the morning and take time to like take time right like it whether it's stretching or yoga or meditation I still try to read instead of watch TV I still try to help people want to listen to people like those things got me through those last three and a half years and have gotten me through the past seven years and I mean to like you know I like I have employees you know what I mean like so I mean when we arrived at Kern it was kind of interesting situation because you meet Tim Devon Jason like we kind of went up on our own and we got there a few hours ahead of the whole bus of volunteers and in many ways that was kind of amazing because they had to improvise you know they weren't gonna start the program until everybody showed up and so it was like we did a bunch of stuff but one of them was you kind of getting up and just really briefly telling guys a little bit about yourself and it was it was amazing to watch the faces of everybody as you said hey look today I run a small company I've got this many employees we're busier than I could ever dream of being we're turning away people I mean it was just these guys were looking at you like really how was that possible man like it seemed so far from where they were in that moment but yet you being able to explain what you did and how you got there is infinitely more interesting and relevant than you know me standing up there saying whatever the hell you know cat was like yeah just tell them what to eat or some [ __ ] like that and I'm like cat

[02:13:48] I'm not gonna [ __ ] stand up there and he tell us by a nutrition with these guys like it just strikes me as like the [ __ ] least interesting thing to talk about right but I mean was there a point when you stopped feeling like an impostor and stopped feeling like a bad person and realized that all the good stuff in your life today your daughter the relationship you have with you parents your girlfriend your employees like the people you are helping like all of this stuff you're not gonna wake up tomorrow it's gonna be gone you know there's not someone around the corner waiting to [ __ ] you over yeah I'm not worried about anybody else

[02:14:31] I don't even know like literally as a person no I know there's no dark force that's gonna like no I think so so bringing it right back to Kern one of the last exercises we did not even step to the line right but the one where we kind of gave a blessing and hands and like forgiveness yeah right you know I feel bad for a lot of things I've done in life but the most is like my daughter like leaving my daughter right and there's days I cry about that today you know like if I start thinking about it and like how beautiful she is and like I like she deserved [ __ ] better right like that so there's those no matter how good today's is like that kid deserved a father when she was 3 2 when she was 11 but it's more like there's moments there's a lot of moments where I'm like that like I do deserve this I've worked for this this is nice this is good and I deserve it right and I deserve there was a moment where I realized like I deserve somebody that will support me as and in a relationship and like as opposed to like somebody else is a gift to me no no like I'm I bring [ __ ] to the table today right like in all areas of my life and I see that but it's more moments than it is all the time and there's still moments where I'm like I don't deserve this and like moments where I where like you know I still doubt myself you know it's it's kind of like the sliding scale right like so those moments have gotten smaller the ones where I doubt myself and like all that self-talk like I barely ever hear that [ __ ] anymore and now what I hear is like no like you deserve it you've worked hard you've gotten a lot of [ __ ] gifts and you've had a lot of support that other people don't have so maybe you should try to support some other people you know maybe you should try to get some people there to you know pay it forward but yeah like now I feel like that voice has really gone away what was the hardest thing for you when we were at current and I my girlfriend and I we we lost a baby like she was pregnant you know it's funny minimized right like it wasn't like a baby that I like I had but I had it in my head right once I believed it I like you know I was in California at devs house like on a surfing trip and like looking at like clothes and [ __ ] and I knew it was gonna be a girl and and I as a man or as me or whatever I pushed it to the back of my head I tried to be strong for her and I just kind of went to work and and they asked if he had lost a child and it like it [ __ ] shipped mice to my socks you know it's like Jesus Christ like I lost it like I did like I lost what I thought I had you know and that hurt and that was hard and then the forgiving myself for my daughter those were the two I think hardest things for me there yeah that was um I know Kat was sort of looking out for me that day she really deliberately paired me with somebody there who she knew that what he and I would sort of share in that moment of what we what was our biggest what is our biggest regret what is the thing we were most ashamed of and what is the thing that we want forgiveness for the most that he and I would have such a strong overlap there I couldn't believe that experience I I don't want to use his name I guess just to protect his privacy but I think about him every day and I think about you know like you know I even called Kat a while ago nasai can I just send him money like I wanted me to be able to buy stuff easily and not have to freaking trade cigarettes and [ __ ] and she's like no volunteers aren't allowed to send money and you know I just and it's like he's the one yeah so of course is he the only guy in that room that was that special no he's just the guy that I got paired with because

[02:18:30] Kat knew there would be this connection and I don't know I just I even now sitting here it's hard to talk about it it's hard to put in words what that experience is like I mean I certainly came away thinking I can't imagine the world not being a better place if every single person would go and spend one day doing that all the people on the outside you know just go and spend one day just you want to talk about empathy you want to talk about compassion you want to talk about understanding that we're all not that far from each other which is an easy thing to do it's such a gift it was such a gift for you and the guys I went was I mean like I can see it on your like face now right and it was it was such a gift for both like that one of the most unique things about it I think it I don't know if she created it or if what what created it but it's it's you're selling things to everybody in the room that cannot be bought right like no matter how successful you are you can't buy that experience right you can't send them money Yeah right like you can't buy that like in no matter like they can't get enough cigarettes to get that either and they can't even believe it right so you're giving them a gift of like a possibility which is an amazing [ __ ] gift right like it's like I can create a future I can create anything and then like what we got was I feel like what we got is more than what we gave but you've never been I've never

[02:20:02] I know I was just about to say I can't I can only say that as an outsider so you're probably the only person who could and not that it matters of course like who God gave whatever but like I remember thinking when when when it was all said and done I was like you know I've never been around another person who's been so grateful for my existence as I was with some of those men that day yeah but didn't yet I you know like I got way more like I left with something that was I mean what you know like I didn't give enough sorry I I apologize because you that's what you were saying like I was saying didn't you feel like you left with something because whoever's devised the way that this works the whole thing gives yeah right it doesn't take and it takes a time it takes time that's all it takes is a day or whatever right but like like that experience gave you what you just I mean like you're like for lack of a better way of saying it or cute or way of saying it like you're a fairly successful or wildly successful person and everything that you've done right and you could probably get you know some things that you could create in your mind like are like that I could go get that but you can't get that like you can't get what you left there that day with you can't get that form of appreciation for your life like what I saw you guys get and what I got to write like in all honesty like what I was able to leave there with I may even be more powerful than what you got because in its own way it was like I found for me like why I [ __ ] suffered for so long right like I mean it makes me a more like this is why I [ __ ] this so that

[02:21:40] I could be where I am so I could be here talking to you like I'm fired you could hear it rightly so that I could help these guys so that they could have somebody that they could believe in right and like that lady gave me a gift you know that girl gave me a gift that jail gave me a gift that I've never never been lucky enough to have and now

[02:22:01] I have and I ain't giving it [ __ ] back house report coming it's good I mean I I'm not a I'm a writer but I'm not a writer so it's it's coming my sister was an editor for a while yeah but my guess is those journals are gold yeah yeah yeah they are I mean they're golden they're also kind of scary because I was [ __ ] crazy and it's funny too cuz stuff's in code like I realized it while I was reading it and like certain stuffs in code cuz you can't write it you know but it's gonna work out it's gonna come together I mean you don't it doesn't happen by chance you don't get on a plane and sit next to the lady and like the guy who did your brain surgery on your way to go do a podcast aren't like on accident like it just it's not a [ __ ] accident like I didn't help dev with his brother six years ago on accident right I don't I don't that's [ __ ] I don't believe in accidents I didn't you didn't send that to dev and like you said like the here the other side of us or you bumped into him seeing his body work I and said hey like oh you know this is on my brain right now yeah and it's one of those things like you know you can say that to a million people and they sort of forget about it by the time they get to their car but like defens not that guy like when

[02:23:15] Devin's in he's all yeah he said yeah let's do it yeah and then he thinks of me and it's like yeah I'm in let's do it like yeah but Kern man Kern and defy and I want to talk to you more about like the directions that's going and everything but yeah i think i think it's a profound experience that we should all have in a lot of different you know i think it should be happening at use facilities i think it should be happening and in other places too probably in the corporate like world or you know like somehow someway we've got to find a way to connect to each other as humans or else we're kind of [ __ ] or would just kind of keep enduring and overcoming which isn't bad but like I'd rather be connected one of my best friends is a psychiatrist and I emailed him recently and I said Paul let's I want to do a podcast where we talk about suicide and I want to talk about it in great detail and I want to understand how much of suicide could be you know evolutionary versus sort of an environmental disease environmental meaning you know a disease of civilization if you will okay and I do wonder again I say this knowing nothing and looking forward to talking to someone who has more experience around this than I will ever have but I wonder how much of what you just said factors into that you know I've heard people say that you know you can be in the most crowded place and yet be the most alone so I what you're basically saying is look it's that connectiveness that sort of undoes that and that's not necessarily about who you're around or not around part of it I guess comes down to a lot of what we saw at Kern which is that vulnerability and I'm amazed at what they can do and you know I think probably by the time this podcast is out

[02:24:59] I don't even know if there will be a defy anymore but the good news is you know defy was just a name sort of irrelevant right there will be a cat Hoke and there will be all the things that she continues to do and it'll be even better than what defy was which was already a man yeah it's nice I need it like we it's gotta happen yeah hit a little it'll happen you hungry I am I am and I need to use a bag yeah alright well let's go get some Greek food nice hey thank you so much happy than anything to be able to hear your story thank you so much for sharing it thanks for asking you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter Adia MD com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
