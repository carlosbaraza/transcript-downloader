This clip is from episode #366 ‒ Transforming education with AI and an individualized, mastery-based education model | Joe Liemandt

In this clip, they discuss:

- Paying Kids for Performance – A proposal is shared about paying middle school students $1,000 if they reach the top 1% academically
- Beyond Knowledge – The most valuable change may be how students view themselves, not just academic gains
- Self-Limiting Beliefs – Many kids enter school believing they can’t succeed in subjects like math or science
- Power of Motivation – External rewards may provide the motivation needed to unlock student potential
- Shift in Self-Image – Once students experience success, their confidence grows and they begin to see themselves as capable

## AI Summary

Based on the provided transcript, I'll analyze the content focusing on the educational aspects discussed, as many of the requested health-related categories aren't covered in this segment.

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a discussion with Joe Liemandt about incentivizing academic achievement through monetary rewards. The main focus is on a program that offers middle school students $1,000 to reach the top 1% in academic performance. The conversation explores the controversy around extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation in education and presents a case for using strategic monetary incentives to unlock student potential.

2. **Key Points**:
- Schools currently spend approximately $20,000 per student per year [00:01:28]
- Program offers $1,000 to students who reach top 1% performance [00:00:00]
- AI technology is used to create personalized learning paths [00:00:29]
- Success stories indicate lasting positive effects on student self-perception [00:04:01]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
- "What's even more important than the academic knowledge? It's their internal view of themselves that changes" [00:00:00]
- "Once you take a middle school kid who's top 1% as they go into high school, they're not going to give it up" [00:01:06]
- "You don't need kindling indefinitely. Sometimes you need kindling." [00:06:43]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the long-term effects of monetary incentives on academic performance?
2. How does the AI system determine personalized learning paths?
3. What metrics are used to define "top 1%" performance?
4. Are there any negative psychological impacts observed in students who don't achieve the goal?
5. How does this approach compare to other educational incentive programs?

Note: Many of the requested categories (Supplements & Medications, Exercise & Movement, Nutrition & Diet, Biomarkers & Testing) are not covered in this transcript segment as it focuses exclusively on educational motivation and incentives.

8. **References & Resources**:
- Mentioned but not specifically cited: Research papers on intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation [00:02:46]
- Reference to "alpha families" and their experiences with the program [00:00:29]

The transcript primarily focuses on educational methodology and motivation rather than health and longevity topics typically covered on The Drive podcast.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] We'll pay kids, right, coming in middle school $1,000 um to get to top 1%. And the point of this is, you know, what's even more important than the academic knowledge? It's their internal view of themselves that changes that kids come in and say, "I'm not a math science girl. I can't be top 1%. I can't do this." Whatever limits they have. And a lot of education when you talk about it is, you know, holistically you're trying to take limits in kids and release them, right?

[00:00:29] And have them understand you're limitless. You can do all this. And this is the best way academically we found to do it. And so they come in and the AI is going to say, "Here's all the lessons you need to do to get to top 1%." And just go through them. And that motivation will get all these kids to top 1%. And the number of stories we have, you know, I have one of my own daughter, but all, you know, the alpha families where their student is like they come back and they're like, I didn't realize I could be top 1% and my personal self-confidence and view of myself that I had to do hard work, right? You had to do the work right now.

[00:01:06] I'm, you know, I I And then once you take a middle school kid who's top 1% as they go into high school, they're not going to give it up because and there's this mental view of, oh, I guess I am a smart kid, right? Or I'm a capable kid, right? And that unlock is so valuable. And so for us, that's when, you know, we think, you know, juicing it with money.

[00:01:28] I mean, we spend 20 grand a kid in this country per student, right? and you're like in middle school give a kid $1,000 in order to have them realize there is that the height there's no limit. Why does why would most people I assume listening to us have sort of an uneasy feeling about that? like they can't reconcile what you just said, which is, well, wait a minute. On the one hand, I know we're spending $20,000 per year per kid on these kids, and we're getting nothing for it, and you're proposing we give them a couple of those thousands of dollars strategically to incentivize half of the equation, which is them having the motivation to do this. And yet, that's going to make a lot of people feel uneasy. Why? So there's a view uh that there needs to be an intrinsic love of learning for it to be pure and that if you it has to be intrinsic not exttrinsic and that if you're buying it it's sullied and not good right it's just it's wrong it's fundamentally wrong and you know and that is a common view are there any data that would support one view being favorable to the other how would that be studied there there is a set of papers that have been written that show that you know if somebody is not intrinsically motivated or is intrinsically motivated and you pay them they lose intrinsic motivation.

[00:02:46] Now that's not the case that we're sitting with. We have kids who aren't motivated who aren't intrinsically going through it, right? They need the boost. Um, and if you actually ask alpha kids, and maybe we'll do a study someday, no parent who has their kids at alpha thinks, "My kids lost their intrinsic motivation." If anything, it's the opposite because now they think they're capable. And those papers don't talk about is how much of the issue was, I didn't think I was capable. I now realize I am. And I get this crazy intrinsic boost around it. Right? I my youngest daughter again would be this example which is you know she came in to middle school you know at uh she hit top 10%. And by the end of 8th grade sorry this was before this is going into seventh grade.

[00:03:41] Okay. She was top 10% coming in. So she had been there but she's like dad I'm not like my older sister. I'm not top 1%. Right. That's just not who I am. Right. I'm Tik Tok girl. you know, if we're going to And I was like, you know, uh, you know what I know, you know, love more than anything is shopping.

[00:04:01] And I'll bet you $1,000 that you can't get to top 1%. And so she literally would fill her Amazon cart with $1,000 of stuff. And in the morning, she'd then look and look at the lessons she had to go through and she'd do it, right? She'd just grind through it. Now, back to this thing. It's, you know, we had a lot of family discussions around this cuz my wife, right, she was like, "Wait, there's two things, and this is most parents are are like this. There's two things here. One, you're setting 1% top 1%." And most parents are like, "That's too hard, right? And, you know, why are you putting that pressure, you know, for on on the kid?" And number two, it doesn't feel right to pay a,000 bucks to get this. This is just We're all brought up that there's something wrong. And so, and but back to the thing. So she does it. She gets top 1% literally buys everything. But then she sits down right with my wife and she's like, "Mom, I know you didn't like us doing this, but you need to understand what this has done for me, which is I never thought I was as smart as my older sister and now

[00:05:07] I realize I can do everything, right, that she can do and it's totally changed my internal view, right?" And that element there of right her and now back she's also the one now who's top 1% on the SAT trying to decide if she wants to do the extra work to get a perfect score right that their that change in their view of their capability that unlock is so valuable and I believe we should do this for every kid in

[00:05:34] America right that but that's the dynamics of why people don't like it and it's you then just have to decide if you can use exttrinsic motivation whatever it is buy them concert tickets buy them right go shopping, whatever, whatever motiv screen time, video game time, whatever it takes to get the kid to realize I can go be and learn all this and be top 1% when I previously didn't think that, right? And I go through that struggle, fail, sometimes cry on the road to success loop. That then unlocks my human potential and right the point of education beyond academics, right?

[00:06:10] You're trying to unlock human potential and this is just a great easy way to do it and it it's not available system. Yeah, that's the thing. You don't it it's not necessarily something that has to happen indefinitely. It's it's it's what I what I think makes sense here is that it's it's an unlock that then creates a new state of awareness that therefore becomes self-perpetuating. So in many ways it's like the kindling that leads to the fire. You don't need kindling indefinitely. Sometimes you need kindling.
