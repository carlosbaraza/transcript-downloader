## Description

Full title: #46 – Chris Masterjohn, Ph.D.: Navigating the many pathways to health and disease – NAD and sirtuins, methylation, MTHFR and COMT, choline deficiency and NAFLD, TMAO, creatine and more

Original release date: 3/25/19

In this episode, Chris Masterjohn, entrepreneur, independent researcher and doctorate in nutrition, elucidates the latest research on the risk and benefits of NAD supplements, and shares his personal intuition on the topic. We also dive deep into choline deficiency and its role in the rising prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. From there, Chris enlightens us on the importance of methylation, a simple yet profoundly important biochemical process affecting our physical and mental health. He also describes the variations of the genes MTHFR and COMT, enzymes which play important roles in methylation and which have profound impacts on our well-being.

We discuss:
-Chris’s background, falling in love with biochemistry, and decision to pursue research over medicine [7:45];
-Choline: what it is, why it is important, and how a deficiency can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [11:45];
-NAFLD: increasing prevalence and potential causes [25:00];
-TMAO: Should we be worried about the TMAO content in choline and our foods? [39:15];
-Types of fatty acids: How they may predispose us to different types of illnesses [53:30];
-Why don’t we see low VLDL in patients with NAFLD? [59:45];
-Understanding flux, and how machine learning may affect medicine in the near future [1:03:15];
-NAD: How it works, supplements, sirtuins, and the central role of the liver [1:09:30];
-Intravenous NAD [1:33:00];
-Oral NR: Is it the optimal way to get more NAD? [1:38:30];
-What is the possible harm of taking an NAD precursor? [1:47:15];
-The MTHFR gene [1:49:45];
-The methylation pathway [1:58:15];
-The COMT gene [2:04:30];
-Creatine: The uses and benefits and it’s important role in methylation [2:10:15];
-Dietary strategies for MTHFR: choline, creatine, folate and glycine [2:16:45];
-How to mitigate the negative effects of NAD supplements [2:23:45];
-A case study of a person with high homocysteine [2:28:00];
-What is the level of evidence that you need to take an action? [2:32:15];
-Does Chris supplement with NAD precursors? And can it improve symptoms of rosacea? [2:35:45];
-Decision making in the face of inconclusive data, and trying to disentangle the placebo effect [2:39:00];
-What does Chris believe to be true that very few people would agree with him about? [2:43:15];
-How to follow Chris’s work [2:48:45]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Chris Masterjohn:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on several key biochemical pathways and their implications for health, particularly:
- The role of choline in liver health and fatty liver disease prevention
- Methylation pathways and their importance (MTHFR, COMT)
- NAD+ precursors and their effectiveness as supplements
- The interconnection between various nutrients and metabolic processes

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Choline deficiency can lead to fatty liver disease [00:13:00]
- Liver requires ~1200mg choline daily for optimal function [00:23:36]
- MTHFR variants affect methylation capacity across population in quintiles [01:52:33]
- NAD+ metabolism primarily occurs in liver with nicotinamide as transport form [01:17:21]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consume adequate choline through eggs and other sources [00:24:27]
- Consider phosphatidylcholine over other forms [01:43:58]
- Match NR supplementation with methyl donors [02:28:05]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- NR (Nicotinamide Riboside): 150-1000mg daily [02:36:39]
- Creatine: 5g daily [02:24:58]
- Glycine: 3-6g before bed [02:20:25]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
Limited discussion of exercise, mainly in context of:
- Creatine supplementation for strength training [02:18:27]
- Collagen synthesis timing with exercise [02:20:25]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Eggs as primary source of choline (130mg per egg) [00:23:36]
- Bone broth for glycine content [02:20:25]
- Importance of food-based sources over supplements [01:43:58]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Homocysteine as marker of methylation status [01:55:22]
- Liver enzymes (ALT/AST) for NAFLD [01:00:37]
- NAD+/NADH ratio [01:11:31]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Cleveland Clinic TMAO papers [00:12:44]
- Rabinowitz group NAD+ metabolism papers [01:24:16]
- DRI report for niacin (1998) [02:46:25]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The methylation cycle is not just about homocysteine, it's about the whole system working together" [01:54:15]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Relationship between MTHFR status and NAFLD risk
- Long-term effects of NR supplementation
- Optimal timing of choline supplementation
- Impact of different forms of exercise on NAD+ metabolism

The episode provides deep biochemical insights while remaining practical for health optimization. The discussion of methylation and NAD+ metabolism is particularly valuable for understanding how these systems interact.
