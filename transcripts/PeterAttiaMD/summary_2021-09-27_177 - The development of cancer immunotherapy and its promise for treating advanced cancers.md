## Description

Steve Rosenberg is the Chief of Surgery at the National Cancer Institute, a position he has held continuously for the past 47 years. Steve is a pioneer in the field of immunotherapies for cancer and a recipient of nearly every major award in science. In this episode, Steve discusses his inspiration for devoting his career to cancer research and describes his keen observation of two cases of spontaneous cancer remission, driving him to learn how to harness the immune system to treat cancer. Steve’s personal story essentially serves as a roadmap for the field of immunotherapy, from the very non-specific therapies such as interleukin-2, the discovery of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cells, and adoptive cell therapy. Perhaps most importantly, Steve expresses his optimism for what lies ahead, especially in the face of some of the more recent discoveries with respect to tumor antigenicity. Finally, Steve discusses the human side of cancer which helps him to never lose sight of why he chose to become a physician.

We discuss:
00:00:00 - Intro
00:00:10 - Steve’s childhood and inspiration to become a physician and medical researcher
00:11:05 - Patients that influenced Steve’s thinking about cancer and altered the course of his career
00:17:42 - The discovery of antigen presentation, Steve’s first job, and why he knew he wanted to study cancer
00:25:42 - Cancer treatment in the early 1970’s and Steve’s intuition to utilize lymphocytes
00:30:56 - Cancer cells vs. non-cancer cells, and why metastatic cancer is so deadly
00:37:50 - The problem with chemotherapy and promise of immunotherapy
00:43:00 - How the immune system works and why it seems to allow cancer to proliferate
00:52:00 - Steve discovers how to use interleukin-2 to mediate cancer regression
01:04:56 - The immunogenic nature of certain cancers and the role of mutations in cancer
01:18:09 - The improbable story of how CAR T cell therapy was developed
01:30:07 - The discovery of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and engineering of T cells to recognize specific antigens
01:38:40 - Steve’s experience treating President Ronald Reagan’s colon cancer
01:44:05 - Why Steve has turned down many tempting job offers to focus on his research at the National Cancer Institute 
01:46:24 - The role of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy and the promise of adoptive cell therapy
01:50:07 - Optimism for using immunotherapy to cure all cancers
01:56:18 - The human side of cancer and the important lessons Peter learned from working with Steve

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. Steven Rosenberg:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This landmark interview covers Dr. Steven Rosenberg's pioneering work in cancer immunotherapy over a 47-year career at the National Cancer Institute. The discussion traces the evolution of immunotherapy from early experimental treatments to modern breakthrough therapies like CAR T-cells and checkpoint inhibitors. Dr. Rosenberg shares insights about his groundbreaking work with Interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and the discovery of cancer neoantigens.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Cancer is defined by two key properties: uncontrolled growth and ability to spread/metastasize [33:22]
- 90% of cancer deaths are from epithelial cancers, 10% from hematologic cancers [35:22]
- Approximately 80% of patients with common epithelial cancers have mutations that can be recognized by the immune system [49:15]
- First successful immunotherapy treatment occurred in 1984 after 67 failed attempts [56:09]
- Melanoma has approximately 400 mutations per tumor, among the highest of all cancers [1:07:05]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- None specifically mentioned for healthy individuals

Context-specific recommendations:
- For cancer patients, seeking clinical trials when standard treatments fail [1:59:14]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Interleukin-2 (IL-2) for immunotherapy [1:31:04]
- Checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1) [1:47:42]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Success consists of moving from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm" - Abraham Lincoln quote referenced by Dr. Rosenberg [1:01:24]

"Cancer is a holocaust" [24:16]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the current limitations in scaling personalized neoantigen therapies?
2. How might future combinations of immunotherapies improve efficacy?
3. What role might artificial intelligence play in identifying targetable mutations?
4. How can we overcome the current barriers to sharing research data between institutions?
