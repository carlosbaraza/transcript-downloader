# #129 - Tom Dayspring, M.D.: The latest insights into cardiovascular disease and lipidology

**Channel:** Peter Attia MD
**Upload Date:** 2020-09-21
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svYYprvlL_U
**Duration:** 120 minutes

## Description

World-renowned lipidologist Tom Dayspring returns to give an update on the current thinking in lipidology as a follow-up to his 2018 five-part podcast series. In this episode, Tom discusses the growing consensus that atherogenic lipoproteins are essential drivers of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Tom further emphasizes apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). He provides insights into risk assessment, including which lab metrics to use, how to interpret them, and the appropriate therapeutic targets. Additionally, Tom discusses the most recent developments in lipid-lowering drug therapies—from the continued evolution of PCSK9 inhibitors, to the latest understanding of EPA and DHA, and the most recent addition of bempedoic acid to the list of  therapeutic agents.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with Dr. Tom Dayspring:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on updates in cardiovascular disease and lipidology since their last conversation two years ago. Key areas covered include:
- The growing recognition of atherogenic lipoproteins (particularly ApoB) as central to cardiovascular disease
- Updates on risk assessment methods
- New developments in lipid-lowering therapies
- The diminishing importance of HDL cholesterol as a metric

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- ApoB is now considered a more reliable metric than LDL-P for measuring atherogenic lipoproteins [15:30]
- 90-95% of ApoB particles are LDL particles due to their longer plasma residence time [22:45]
- HDL cholesterol is no longer considered a useful therapeutic target [45:20]
- Average HDL particle contains ~45 cholesterol molecules vs. 1500-2000 in LDL [48:15]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Get Lp(a) tested once in early adulthood [1:12:30]
- Focus on ApoB reduction rather than just LDL cholesterol [25:40]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
New Medications Discussed:
- Bempedoic acid (Nexletol) - new cholesterol synthesis inhibitor [1:35:20]
- EPA (4g/day) showing significant cardiovascular benefit [1:45:30]
- Fibrates still valuable for specific patient populations [1:55:15]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
Key Tests:
- ApoB as primary metric for atherogenic lipoproteins [20:15]
- Lp(a) testing recommended once in lifetime [1:12:30]
- VLDL cholesterol as proxy for remnant lipoproteins [1:28:45]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Lower is better when it comes to ApoB, and with current therapeutics, we can often attain physiologic concentrations under 50 mg/dL" [1:32:15]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What role will genetic testing play in future lipid management?
- How will new Lp(a)-lowering therapies impact treatment strategies?
- What is the full explanation for the failed EPA/DHA combination trial?
