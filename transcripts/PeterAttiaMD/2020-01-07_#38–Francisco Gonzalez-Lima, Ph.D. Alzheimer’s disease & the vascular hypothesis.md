In this episode, Francisco Gonzalez-Lima, a Professor of Neuroscience and Pharmacology & Toxicology, explains the vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease which says the central problem is a progressive neuronal energy crisis of impaired blood flow to the brain and impaired mitochondrial respiration. He walks us through the ways we can intervene in this process and also shares details of the exciting future of Alzheimer’s treatment and prevention.

We discuss:
-Background and interest in the brain [5:15];
-The unique nature of the human brain [9:15];
-Why we’ve made so little progress in Alzheimer’s research [23:00];
-The amyloid beta hypothesis [28:30];
-Hypometabolism in the brain leading to cognitive decline [39:30];
-Early signs of AD, and deciphering between age-related decline versus something pathologic [47:45];
-The vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease [54:00];
-The relationship between mitochondria, cytochrome c oxidase, and Alzheimer’s disease [1:08:00];
-Chronic inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase leads to chronic neurodegenerative disease [1:22:45];
-Major risk factors for AD, head trauma, and other forms of dementia [1:33:45];
-Methylene blue for treating and preventing neurodegeneration [1:38:15];
-Current standard of care for AD, and the reasons for a lack of advancement [2:01:45];

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Francisco Gonzalez-Lima:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the vascular hypothesis, challenging the traditional amyloid-beta hypothesis. Dr. Gonzalez-Lima explains how late-onset Alzheimer's disease may primarily be a progressive neuronal energy crisis caused by impaired blood flow and mitochondrial respiration. The discussion covers potential preventive approaches including methylene blue, near-infrared light therapy, and metabolic interventions.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Original Alzheimer's case from 1907 was likely early-onset disease, different from common late-onset AD [38:00]
- Cytochrome oxidase (Complex IV) is more inducible than other electron transport chain complexes [1:19:30]
- Brain consumes 20% of body's energy while being only 2% of body weight [55:16]
- Chronic hypoperfusion leads to approximately 20% decrease in brain blood supply between ages 22-60 [2:07:36]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Regular fasting periods (14-16 hours) to maintain ketogenic enzyme function [2:22:49]
- Blood pressure management below 120/80 [1:02:00]
- Cardiovascular health optimization benefits brain health [1:08:20]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Ketogenic diet may be particularly beneficial for brain function [2:18:09]
- Transcranial near-infrared light therapy targeting prefrontal cortex [2:07:36]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:

Methylene Blue:
- Low dose (1mg/kg) for neuroprotective effects [2:26:27]
- Different grades available (pharmaceutical grade recommended) [1:54:40]
- Can be administered orally or intravenously [1:37:00]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Morning workout can help accelerate glucose utilization during fasting [2:22:49]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Ketogenic diet benefits for brain metabolism [2:18:09]
- Importance of periodic fasting [2:22:49]
- Mother's milk naturally contains medium-chain triglycerides [2:18:09]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Near-infrared spectroscopy can measure oxidized cytochrome oxidase in vivo [2:24:50]
- Blood pressure monitoring [1:02:00]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Book: "Alzheimer's Turning Point" by Jack de la Torre [1:49:57]
- Multiple NIH grants mentioned for near-infrared research [2:24:50]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The amyloid-beta hypothesis is completely, absolutely false." [29:32]
"If you have a brain, you're at risk." [1:02:26]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What is the optimal dosing protocol for methylene blue in prevention?
- How might combination therapy with methylene blue and near-infrared light work?
- What role might methylene blue play in acute traumatic brain injury?

Let me know if you would like me to expand on any of these sections.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination and obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and

[00:01:05] I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because

[00:02:09] I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Francisco Gonzalez Lima a professor of neuroscience and pharmacology and toxicology at the

[00:04:18] University of Texas Austin in this episode we talk about Alzheimer's disease in particular Francisco explains the vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease hypothesis that his colleague and collaborator at ut-austin Jack dilatory introduced to the field about 25 years ago he makes the case that the central problem in late onset Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neuronal energy crisis meaning impaired blood flow to the brain and impaired mitochondrial respiration if the problem is an energetic crisis Francisco argues then we can improve the supply of energy and blood to the brain we could probably make progress in the prevention of

[00:04:55] Alzheimer's disease we of course get into great detail at about all of this stuff and to paraphrase my friend and my colleague Richard Isaacson who I've already spoken with on the podcast a while back as you may remember and who directs the Alzheimer's prevention clinic at Cornell if you have a brain you don't want to miss this episode so without further delay here is my conversation with Francisco comes on asleep so how are you

[00:05:21] Lyons thank you thank you so much for making time to see me on a Friday afternoon my pleasure this is actually my first time to the University I've been to Austin many times but I never seem to be north of downtown so it was beautiful to drive by the Medical Center on the way here it's kind of amazing I haven't even been to a football game which I hope to one day do at some point so only been in Austin I've been here as a tenured professor for 27 years Wow yes and during that time I started out in our pharmacology and toxicology and moved to psychology just added that then the recruiting institution was the

[00:06:05] Institute for Neuroscience and now I'm a faculty also the Department of Psychiatry at the new Medical School and we were talking a little bit earlier you describe yourself as a behavioral neuroscientist yes tell me a little bit about what that title means why behavioral my original training as obesity was anatomy and neurobiology and then as a postdoctoral fellow I try to understand how the brain related to behavior and I did that work as a humble fellow in Germany and that was my introduction to the study of functional brain mapping and how we could see behavioral functions reflected in brain activity this was a time where we developed the fluorodeoxyglucose how to write a graphic method in the German group in Russia that later became the key to who develop fdg-pet the first functional imaging technique in humans it's interesting you say that because I noticed that a number of patients when I talk to them don't understand sometimes the difference because I don't think physicians explain the difference between functional studies and imaging studies and I remember feeling very fortunate in medical school during a radiology rotation where one of the residents sat me down and explained the difference and the pet of course the FDD positron emission tomography being a great example of a functional study it's not giving you an atomic resolution it's giving you functional resolution with respect to glucose uptake and similarly you have that you now have functional

[00:07:45] MRI which is doing the same sort of thing and so yeah that's a very important distinction and especially important if you want to be able to determine a disease in a very early stage in which there are no structural changes in the brain that can be seeing at least at the microscopic level and having functional techniques you're able to identify these functional changes even before you have any other signs of the disease so I know you you're a gentleman who has spent time all over the place you were born in Cuba you left

[00:08:22] Cuba when you were quite young you spent time in Costa Rica Venezuela I mean where did where did you and my Puerto Rico of course all of those things at what point did it become clear to you that you were interested in the brain I think my father was a veterinary doctor and originally my interests have to do with working with animals but soon I realized the nervous system was so important for the entire health of the animal and the behavior so I started to move away from just more general interest to something they had to do more with the brain but I would say my key influence happened as an undergraduate at Tulane University in

[00:09:07] New Orleans when one of my professors dr. join King this sector of rain in one of our classes and this was an undergraduate honors class and it was fascinating to me and I joined her lab to do an honors thesis working on the relationship between the brain hormones and behavior in animal models it's really so interesting I think back to my own time in medical school there were clearly a subset of my colleagues who were so captivated by the brain which in gross anatomy really doesn't depict a fraction of its brilliance right unlike the heart we're certainly microscopically there are things about the heart that are relevant you can't see the Purkinje fibers you can't see the a v note or the sa no there's so much that is invisible to the naked eye but for the most part you can appreciate the brilliance of the heart at the macroscopic level but then there are other organs that you know on the other end of the spectrum get no attention like the liver

[00:10:09] I mean microscopically it's just a lump of whatever but of course what's happening inside delivered to me makes it one of the most remarkable organs but the brain is an organ that has such a unique look right grossly it looks so distinct the tissue looks so distinct from all of the other tissue outside of the central nervous system and also to this day I would say our knowledge of the brain must be far far behind that of any other organ at the sort of physiologic signaling level I mean is that I mean is that a fair assumption or yes I agree completely and I was using the same analogy so you have the heart you can think of it as a mechanical engineer pump a hydraulic pump whereas the brain is more of an electrical engineer or you have lots of circuits and delivery for that matter will be a chemical engineer where we break down all of these the bully consumes I actually love that

[00:11:08] I've never thought of what you just said and that is a great way to explain that different types of engineering the kidney would be some sort of sanitation filtering engineer I mean we could really empowerment pool yeah and so in many ways the brain is probably not only electrical engineering but it's computer science engineering course it's there's so much going on there right you hit in a very important point one cannot simply look at the brain the same way that you look at other organs because of that sort with property here allows the development of computational power so the brain uses the circuits not just for communication which is the most obvious function but to determine and compute outcomes that they are used to get the other tissues in the body for example the musculoskeletal system cannot do anything on his own without the commands the result of computations from the nervous system so all of our behavior results from how the nervous system process our experiences and our current situations and it's become not in the same way he has a computer works there is a serial device the brain is a very redundant parallel system what they have to be a lot of converging see between different regions are computing for that to be acknowledged as the way to go in in behavioral point of view so for a person listening to this who might not have the luxury of knowing some of the the nuances about the brain that you do when you're talking to an audience that is presumably most people are interested in the brain because of brain pathology it's you know once once a disease strikes the brain everybody becomes well aware of how much it's doing because the absence of that function leads to such an obvious downside how do you describe for people this notion of convergence and redundancy and overlap I mean obviously there's a very strong evolutionary reason what are some examples of those and how those things are these processes are preserved in terms of because you use I like the use of I'm an engineer so I do like the use of talking about serial versus parallel processing maybe expand on that a little bit in reality all of the anatomy is redundant and parallel at least for example we have bilateral symmetry you know everybody knows we have two hands two legs two eyes we probably could have done it with one eye but the way the system works is that it creates redundancy and in for example this circulatory system is the same you have parallel blood vessels where you can get the blood from one point to another in more than one way and of course when you sit when you put your elbow down you can compress a blood vessel but there is still another route that can be used it's like coming from the University to the downtown area you have many options to get from one point to the other so in the brain this is maximized to its extreme is an organ is specialized for this large amount of communications in other words having so many highways and avenues where information can go through so in that sense differs from other organs where you have a pattern that repeats itself and the redundancy is only on that pattern here in the brain the redundancy is combined with the acquisition of new networks or circuit auctions there are not possible if you only have one design so you have multiple designs if you want an analogy for example when NASA was sending the man to the moon they have like a hundred computers doing the same computation and then they look at the output and they see which is a output that is repeated more often and that's the one that those coordinates are the one that they're gonna pass on the brain uses their strategy and that's what I mean by converging C in other words you have all these multiple parallel system and they are doing these computations for all the ones a converge on the same solutions are the ones that are acknowledged and move on for the next stage and when you look at other species beyond humans how much of that redundancy do you see as you go down the evolutionary chain or down the food chain maybe is an easier way to think about it I mean at what presumably you know chimps and cats and dogs are very similar but is there a point at which it very suddenly stops or does it simply diminish to the point where you know when you're looking at a simpler organism like a worm for example I don't even know what the nervous system of C elegans looks like well definitely mammals and primates in particular where basic plan is the same and most of the differences have to do where which of the networks are more developed than others so in primates we have the cerebral cortex becoming the dominant component in the ring this is to a certain degree the same thing in all the mammals but then other regions of the brain have more similar contribution when you go down to for example reptiles or amphibians the midbrain the mesencephalon is the largest part of the brain not the portion where we have the cerebral cortex and what that means basically is in addition to this parallel processing that we have information goes through several hierarchical stages and at every one of the stages similar processing is done and you add an additional piece of information when you move it on for example you can respond at the level of the spinal cord that will be the lowest level response that would be for example a reflex like if you tap somebody's knee you transiently lengthen the patellar tendon the knee kicks out to straighten it or reduce the length and that is happening outside of the brain yes however when you tap the knee the information also goes to all the levels of the nervous system in that case you saw the spinal

[00:17:47] Lexx be manifested but the person still knows yes I felt the sensation and when I know what happened so the same was happening a different hierarchy level processing so behaviorally speaking when we respond to a stimuli add very basic level like what you indicated like the spinal level we call it a reflex so we the most basic behavioral response but that means that you are not seeing what is happening at the other levels but for example in a frog that is following an insect a worm has is moving the Frog with orient to the movement as long as the worm is moving in the same direction as the long axis of the body you have the same warm that is a fake worm where he's moving in a direction perpendicular to the long long the the frog will not follow so the pattern isn't recognized so if a frogs is a worm moving in the normal direction of worm moves it knows that pattern if it sees the exact same food source standing up and walking on the side it's not going to pursue it's not pursuing it so but in order to do they had a new computation then you needed the level of the midbrain so the midbrain becomes now the point where the decision is made and with it to follow and then eventually snap and capture the worm so the super mailing species primarily operate at that level and they have well-defined instead of being color reflex we would call this light release stimulus release the stimulus creates that generates a pattern there is a parent generator that recognizes it but then then in mammals we have to move information to the level of the thalamus there is in the middle of the brain but higher than the midbrain and then from the hair the majority of the mass of the brain is in primates and humans in particular is in the cerebral cortex so we have to pass that information to the series cortex and then feed that back down do they help put systems so it might be a way of oversimplifying but one could think of it as the brainstem and spinal cord are responsible for these reflexes for example we breathe without thinking because our brainstem allows us to we recoil from pain without thought because of these things the midbrain took it up a notch by basically allowing for that stimulus response but the thalamus then becomes the Gateway to the cortex where we can do this higher process and that's probably an oversimplification but and the main contribution of this thalamocortical system is to allow us to inhibit behavior in other words not to respond in a more immediate short-term matter so the ability to delay and respond and to try to compute what are the consequences if we were to make that response this is what really is brought up by our more elaborate cerebral cortex so the majority of the influence of the cerebral cortex on subcortical levels its inhibitory it's not excitatory no and and engineers actually don't stand this very well when they for example try to create a prosthetic device to have somebody send neural impulses to move a leg that is paralyzed they try to create this as an excitatory type of phenomenon but what the brain is doing is not like that what the brain is doing is inhibiting all possible vectors of movement in space and then selectively releasing some of them by sending an inhibitory signal to them yeah it inhibits the inhibitory signal thereby selectively releasing activation yes and when you do that you have more control because you are actually for every movement you're not just working as a puppet were you trying to only emulate those vectors you're controlling all of the other possibilities so you sort of curve a tunnel in space which are the only factors are allowed to be manifested so the the engineer of the brain in this sense requires this more effort in order to achieve something a good being achieved by a more simplified system because it wants that control so is it safe to say that more of the pathology that we see in the brain occurs in the cortex than in the midbrain for example Parkinson's I guess would be partially midbrain right primarily yeah other other great examples of common pathology in the brainstem yes but from the point of view of the main chain and neurodegenerative disorders with the section of Parkinson disease these are primarily cerebral cortex this is where you see especially the initial functional deficits and later on the atrophy and loss of tissue but most of the diseases of all age that affect the brain primarily target these cortical regions and that's obviously the thing that I most wanted to to chat with you about because you and your colleagues you have a different point of view on

[00:23:24] Alzheimer's disease and in many ways it's when you you know read your work or hear you guys talk about it it doesn't sound that hard to believe it's actually quite a reasonable hypothesis let's start with the conventional thinking on Alzheimer's disease which needs to be caveated with the fact that there is no disease for which we have had a greater failure in our ability to treat it than this one even cancer which one could argue we're not exactly hitting it out of the park on we at least have some success we can point to very very specific successes not only in terms of prevention for example simply the recognition that something like smoking could cause cancer led to an enormous reduction in a continued enormous reduction in the onset of that disease but also very specific chemo therapeutic regimens for a subset of cancers particularly liquid cancers and now more recently we've seen some real breakthroughs with things like checkpoint inhibitors on even solid organ tumors so at least with cancer we have some sense of we're making progress certainly with heart disease we've probably made the mo progress and yet with this disease it appears we have not made a shred of progress what is the typical explanation for what causes Alzheimer's disease and therefore by extension what the path should be to prevented or treated you're completely right we have not made any significant progress in Alzheimer's disease research this is the largest failure of the biomedical research enterprise in the world during my lifetime and the main reason is we have remained faithful to an initial observation that was done or publish a list in 1907 by Louis Alzheimer's that indicated that his oldest are normal depositions in the brains of an individual after their individual died this individual was 51 years old when he died but Alzheimer's was actually a psychiatrist not a neuropathologist like his pointed out in books he worked in a psychiatric hospital it was part of the original group led by crippling in Munich and they were studying mental illness and in those days it was believed that what we call nowadays dementia was a form of mental illness and he was surprised by this young patient that was showing these early signs of dementia you know in his fifties and already by the time he died that person had been suffering for many years so what Alzheimer's described has in the brain of that individual has Alzheimer's disease is not the same disease that is happening in older people it is not the same disease there is the most common type of dementia and this is being the most basic misunderstanding from the beginning historically there was a competition between two groups one in

[00:26:34] Prak in Czech Republic at that time was under German rule and Oscar fee sure published studies were for example he looked at 16 brains from patients ahead what was called senile dementia that is the type of dementia that was showing up in people after the world 60 70 80 years of age not these younger individuals and he describes some of these same uh normality that later there are diamonds published but for that single case however crippling was rival that grew especially about feature who was Jewish and so he published in the first book that talk about Alzheimer's the first textbook of Psychiatry that was published by crippling and then he say Oh what we're seeing in these old people this type of dementia is what

[00:27:32] Alzheimer's described in that younger individual and from their own there was moving away from factors that were related to aging and to say this is a disease that is invading somehow and it's not something that is building up over the years of course this is actually not the case so nowadays they try to have a compromise and say

[00:27:58] Alzheimer's disease there is early onset or familial which is primarily familial there is some evidence for inheritance but nine out of ten cases of what is referred to as Alzheimer's disease there is absolutely no inheritance or familial component which is one of the greatest fears of people when they have patients with dementia in their family and not only that is aging related and because it develops very slowly over the decades it provides an opportunity to intervene to determine what are the risk factors that are behind and to do an intervention if you take the other approach that this is a disease of these are normal proteins and it can happen early on then you have a very different strategy so the whole feel has been dominated primarily by what is called the amyloid-beta hypothesis this is hypothesis completely absolutely false he has no relationship whatsoever with what we see in the older people that develop dementia he has a relationship with some of these early cases that like the one that Alzheimer's described and they have a familial component and that there is a somatic genetic component let me just didn't represent to make sure

[00:29:32] I'm understanding this is obviously such an important point that I want to make sure I'm clear and that the listener is clear now the case that Alzheimer's found in 1907 I have to assume that was a PSE N 1 or 2 mutation that was what we now see accounting for less than 1% of Alzheimer's disease but it is probably the closest to a fully penetrant gene that results in Alzheimer's disease has that ever been confirmed are there any biologic specimens remaining from that particular individual who was so young there are slides available body has never been confirmed and the patient died in 1906 after many years with this chronic dementia in that hospital in Munich and he was deteriorating every other respect by that time he unable to move and carry on own activities of daily living so he's been suffering from this for many years which is not unlike what we can see in the rare patients do have the PS en 1 or 2 gene which is it can easily take hold in the 40s I unfortunately have a patient whose mother is you know debilitated in her mid 50s now it turns out she doesn't have the gene which was a surprise to a lot of us we assumed because it had taken hold so early but the autopsy the pathology that they could see which at the time was limited to very gross things relative to today gross for the listener I don't mean grosses and disgusting I mean gross as in visible through a microscope it was this the first time that amyloid beta was observed no the first time was done by oskar feature in this inhale the main so Alzheimer's was basically describing a phenotype but without a pathologic explanation or characteristic yes but because it was happening so early then it moved the people away from the idea that distance do with senility with the older deterioration that happens the function of aging so say or know this can happen early on so aging cannot be a primary contributor so even the whole very small percentage of people there are described as having Alzheimer's belongs to these early onset over 90% of the research is focus on the group and they their reasoning is because it's the same disease which is a false premise if we find out what's happening in the early onset and we model the hurting animals by doing this genetic manipulation then we can fix the more common say mile older age late onset dementia and that false premise is what has been driving all these failures because yes they have been able to detect genetic changes they can manipulate this I was able to work examine the brain of the first amyloid precursor mouse model that was developed and one of the first things that I noticed in the brains even before there was any amyloid deposition in that model that they had inserted they had it was a transgenic mouse model they had taken away the native gene from the mouse and replaced that gene we wonder with Ag normal for on a patient with early onset

[00:32:54] Alzheimer's but even before the gene could store any any observable deposition of amyloid these brains by that very manipulation were abnormal they had severe atrophy in for example the corpus callosum and all that communicates to Hemisphere and the region of the hippocampal formation has lost one third of his volume so the intervention it's of may have altered the resilience if nothing else of the brain and of course then these animals show all kinds of behavioral and or maladies but these things were happening even before there was any amyloid deposition so it was clear that having a gene with these enormities even before you can see the product building up is enough to distort how the brain develops so this is being the main problem and because biology just like when I started studying biology my major was called cell and molecular biology and that became the dominant orientation in biology so people who do this research oftentimes don't have a really good understanding of the brain as a whole and they just focus at that molecular level and in a way they're trying to find the answer with the light is there is the light that they can use and trying to ignore that this is really a disease of all age that involves a long development and that there is absolutely no correlation nor relationship between the amount of for example amyloid beta deposition and the onset of memory deficits cognitive impairment or the progression of the disease there are brains of individuals that I have the fortune to examine here in

[00:34:52] Austin Hassam primarily and neuroanatomy the functional errata means I collaborate with the narrow pathologies here and the brains of these people who were cognitively normal after they died they couldn't differentiate them from they ones that were diagnosis Alzheimer's based on amyloid and never fillory tangle depositions that's an enormous statement it doesn't call into question the causality of amyloid it just calls into it the necessity and sufficiency of it in other words it could be that you have to have

[00:35:28] I mean I'm making this up but to illustrate a point within logic it could be that you need to have a Molloy betta deposition to cause dementia but that is not sufficient it is only a necessary condition and that you might need other factors to coalesce around that the obvious example that comes to my mind is LDL and a PO B which is necessary for cardiovascular disease but not alone sufficient you still need an inflammatory response and an immune response I go beyond that point what I'm saying he's against adult month you're saying one step further than that you are saying that not only is the deposition of amyloid not correlated strongly enough it might not even be causally related not not even it is not causally related to what we call primarily Alzheimer's disease with is this majority or late onset that's not true for the early onset what I'm saying is that there are two different diseases the early onset there is a role for these amyloid deposition you can demonstrate these in other words if you take autopsies of 50 year olds that die from heart disease cancer or accidental death and you examine their brains relative to 50 year olds who die from early onset dementia the relationship is more clear it is clear the amyloid beta is playing a causal role yes there is no question and you can find genetic mutations and you can induce it in the animal but that's not the case in the late onset and the neuropathologists will tell you if they don't know what the clinical picture was they wouldn't be able to say that this was what they referred to as a probable Alzheimer's disease so when they see this act to the same pathology and there's no evidence of cognitive deterioration they just diagnose that brain as possible

[00:37:27] Alzheimer's disease so this created a circular definition to be clear to close the loop on that analogy with heart disease you would have to know that there are cases where patients have significant dementia that by all other metrics is consistent with Alzheimer's dementia not Lewy body or some thing else and there is an absence of amyloid-beta deposition yes and what percentage approximately I know it's hard to know these things because we don't always get autopsies but in your experience what percentage of patients who die with or from

[00:38:06] Alzheimer's disease that is late onset do not have the histopathologic features of amyloid beta the majority of patients there are diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease Pro Alzheimer's disease when they die have the same level it's not that they don't have because this thing age-related deposition the same level of all the patients are comparable age and the only reason that their label has

[00:38:37] Alzheimer's is because they had dementia the pathology cannot really tell them apart if you give this to pathology is blind to the medical diagnosis or clinical examination they won't be able to tell apart which are the ones are actually demented and which are not if you do it in a match there is a large degree of variability in pathologies are not quantitative pathology is an approximation you look at only a few sections through the cortex and then you give a certain proportion of the findings that are found that you see as categories but even when I have done this personally in 2001 we polish in the general neuroscience and study where we use brains from people who died from

[00:39:29] Alzheimer's the main difference from my study from what's been done before is that we were able to obtain brains we'd only have three hours after the individuals had died we call the very small post-mortem interval and I was able to do this by collaborating with the Institute in Arizona there is a city called Sun City

[00:39:54] Arizona and they have a Sun City Health Center which actually ascribes to this law there Larry tangle ideas but what we did with them was we were we travel there and with my PhD student we collected his brains control brains and brain so people have that died of Alzheimer's some of them we were able to collect him fresh right there and were you and your team also blinded to the circumstances of the death prior to the autopsies being performed no what we did is we collected all the brains and they were i-section them into pieces and these pieces they were frozen and then one sample would remain there I see I see so you did everything in parallel yeah will be shipped here to

[00:40:46] Austin and once the samples were cheap they were coded but when we were there no we knew when somebody died because I had a pathologist with me what certify they were dead so that we could immediately but when the the pairwise results were evaluated the evaluator was blind to the clinical circumstances of the patient's death yes what we did in that study was we were not only interested in just looking at amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles been done we were interested in seeing is there any biochemical change that could account for this so-called hypometabolism this decrease in energy metabolism that is seeing early in

[00:41:35] Alzheimer's is it generally well regarded bringing it back to some of your earlier work in pet I assume it is generally agreed upon the patients who are in the stages of cognitive decline have type-o functioning metabolism so their PET scans show less glucose uptake in the brain is that generally acknowledged and not only fdg-pet when you do also cerebral blood flow you find the same when you do a femoral arterial spin labeling to look at blood flow every technique that have been used has demonstrated that first it was with mild

[00:42:13] Alzheimer's cases but more recently also with them so-called mild cognitive impairment that nowadays also referring to was a mile neurocognitive disorder and in those cases there is hypometabolism and they hyper metabolizing is primarily not in the regions that become a trophic later on in the disease like in the temporal lobe it's primarily in the posterior cingulate cortex one region of the brain that is in the medial bar in the center of the brain this area is the one that you can see having early sign of hypometabolism and from a phenotypic standpoint what does it control in the normal brain this region provides the major input to what is called the inter anal cortex which is the part of the temporal hope that then feeds into the hippocampal formation so what essentially is happening is you have a functional disconnection between the main input to the entorhinal cortex the internal cortex is the primary source of inputs to the hippocampal formation so when you functionally generate a region in the brain eventually that leads to atrophy from the region that is receiving the stimulus he was receiving that just like happens when you denigrate a muscle in the periphery there is a trophic action and action that that region survives because it's being stimulated by the other one so people have missed when you study pathology you don't study these functional changes and you don't look at the system as a network of pathways or influence functionality you're seeing the end result what has happened after all these processes are taking place over the years so by doing that you cannot in fear this all the phenomena if you take an animal like a mouse and you just take out the it's the posterior cingulate the procedures if you lesion that in a rat or a mouse acutely which is not the same as what's presumably happening in this diseased state what is the immediate phenotype of that animal or behavior well you don't have to live in it you can functionally deactivate which is more similar to what it's actually happening in Alzheimer's is not that this region is damaged structurally right it's just functionally not allowing the conduit yeah it's a signaling affecting that network that is providing the main input to the hippocampal formation you get the same kind of memory deficits there are characteristics of the initial stages of dementia and is that because of the role the hippocampus plays in the consolidation of memory or is it to do more with this the target in the temporal lobe it is because it's a network not a single region in other words for example long time ago in the nineteen thirties there was a circuit that was defined by an American never

[00:45:31] Anatomy is called Jane's Pappy's also pronounced apes' and he describes the connections between the cingulate cortex this parahippocampal cortex that we now primarily referred to as the internal cortex and then from the hair to the hippocampal formation from the hippocampal formation the main output goes to region called the mammillary bodies and then from the mammillary bodies he goes to the anterior part of the thalamus and then from the thalamus it fans out the projections back into the cingulate cortex so it creates a circle and this is often being referred to as the limbic circuit of papers and we know he has to do with emotional memory formation because events that have a large emotional signature are the ones we store we create the greatest memories from the yes so if you affect this system anywhere in this system you get a memory disease and they just have different names so for example people have chronic alcohol they developed sometimes referred to as a where Korsakoff dementia mm-hmm also known as korsakoff's psychosis I can get this from B vitamin deficiencies as well b1 deficiency diamine deficiency particular you look at the pathology of the brain where is the damage the damage is primarily in the mammillary bodies well the mammillary body is the main output from the hippocampal formation so whatever the hippocampus formation is contributing if you were knocking down his main output target you get the same thing then the in a second place is the hippocampal formation itself then the entrant cortex and so on all you have damaging any part of the circuit system there's also something called diencephalic retrograde amnesia that happens with tell'em equations well this is when these lesions interfere with these anterior dynamic areas so really in order for us to see the memory problems that we have linked usually with Alzheimer's dementia you have to engage this system because that system is part of the forebrain regions in which this is operating you use the term retrograde therefore the listener we should explain the difference between retrograde and antegrade amnesia I'll let you do that quickly but of course my follow-up question will be in the earliest stages of dementia is the bigger issue the inability to form new short-term memories which would be a form of antegrade amnesia that that would happen before the the retrograde amnesia which is later lemmie is playing in the early

[00:48:19] Alzheimer's disease the main problem is not in this limbic circuit when that happens is when I when you can see the hypometabolism that's when you can see the behavioral changes in the individual as well but before that in the prefrontal cortex especially the lateral we call dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex you have a functional deficit that is interfering with what we call working memory so you can think of memories as having three more or temporal stages an immediate memory mode where you can remember sayings for only a few seconds tell me your phone number and I have to write it down that's all right that's just a perfect example a clinician will do this by giving a string of numbers to people and people will be able to remember approximately seven numbers so it is usually seven plus or minus two items and this is the reason why the telephone numbers have seven digits because most people after reading seven digits turning around to try to punch those numbers in the phone if there are more than seven they drop some of them is this immediate memory mode but for memories to happen they have to move from this immediate memory mode to a more recent memory mode so they mediate that movement from immediate to reason is done with these prefrontal cortex so the initial deficit that you see in

[00:49:57] Alzheimer's and all of these types of dementia of all age is in this more immediate memory more and one way we refer to this is also working memory so for example you come out of your house and you will lock the door but after a few seconds you work into your car then you ask did I lock the door or is it unlock and then you have to go back and check so this is the first thing that you're gonna have any happens physiologically as a function of aging and this is the first one these were the memory things are so the prefrontal one is the initial signal that there is a memory problem this is before and this is an anti rate memory in other words it's a new memory that you want to form so this is the first thing that is affected but once the memory are in their recent memory mode this for example would be your phone number which yes is one of the easy seven digits to remember because you're so familiar with it that it's now quote-unquote permanent memory by repetition by exposure to the same items these reverberate in that limbic circuit that I just saw you and the hippocampal formation has an inner circuit that is crucial for that so it is crucial for that forming and then you being able to retrieve that number again so when that circuit becomes engaged at any point then you start having this retrograde memory problem you cannot remember your number which is interesting that's the point at which the family members tend to really notice what's happening you become concerned yes but the patients tend to become concerned much sooner the patients become concerned with the antegrade memory deficits you are absolutely right how do you distinguish between something you said a moment ago which was this slight deficit of formation of new memory is on some levels not necessarily a pathological finding as we age but how do we differentiate between the pathologic or the appropriate age-related versus the potentially you know the harbinger of something pathologic it is difficult to draw the line this is one of the main reasons that is the Ignacio of mild cognitive impairment has been elusive I have asked this question to all the researchers and I get very many different opinions and the main reason is that the only way to know for sure is to compare this to your own history to compare it to yourself so in this case the patient and their immediate patterns they are more knowledgeable whether there being a change if you just compared to standardized age population you may not see any difference but they the patient will tell you know I know

[00:52:49] I'm having more difficulty with for example this working memory task so it is a challenge but they the beauty of this is you don't have to wait because everybody goes through this cognitive decline is just to different extent and will start out at a different level of cognitive performance so it's very difficult to have a standard so my approach is to try to intervene at that point and therefore the main target at that point is to interbeing in the prefrontal cortex the region that is just behind your forehead and that one engages we call on a central executive network that for cognitive processing that is involved in working memory there is involving problem-solving there is involving sustained attention vigilance those are the things that are gonna be seen first having a decline as you grow older just like all kinds of teachers decline as you grow older this is a reality but it is possible to intervene then before you get into the limbic system problems and that's the approach that we have done and in our interventions and I think this is what's gonna make the biggest difference so let's go back to now this revised hypothesis if I can summarize the actual nomenclature of Alzheimer's disease might be a bit of an unfortunate artifact and that it was first observed in a subset of what would become this disease that really isn't representative of the epidemic that we're seeing today absolutely right and so we'll put that aside for a moment because despite how tragic those early onset cases are and they strike me as among the most tragic things I've ever seen in medicine by the way you have more experience with this the thing that's running amok right now is this sort of late onset dementia that it seems to me that we are probably diagnosing it much more than we were before but it also seems to be increasing out beyond just the rate of diagnosis and it also seems to be increasing at a rate disproportionate to the increase in our longevity which is really not that significant I believe that human longevity is increasing at about 0.4% per year in the United States and yet the rate of growth of

[00:55:16] Alzheimer's disease is growing much more than that so if you discount that somewhat for the rate of for the diagnostic acumen or urgency with which we seek it there's still a gap which means on a real level not just a perceived level this disease is becoming more common in your research you talk about five areas of study that help you think about this the epidemiology of the disease the imaging of the disease the pharmacologic response to the disease the pathologic findings in the disease and then the clinical course of the disease you and your colleagues have a different hypothesis that pertains to the vascular system yes this is actually the original hypothesis that was associated with sanaya dementia I don't want to take credit for the people who gone after that because in the early the AC which was an idea not well formulated but what seems to be happening is if you compromise circulation to the brain you're always gonna get a neurological deficit however in the case of we seeing has late onset dementia that I may refer to as features dementia as both to the early onset Alzheimer's dementia which is what should be named there is a chronic hypoperfusion that is the brain is receiving less blood supply and for example it is known that between 22 years old to 60 years old there is a decrease of about 20% on your supply of blood to the brain so some people are calculated are approximately half of a percentage per year in statistical terms do we have a sense of why how much of that I mean he's I think a layperson might understandably but I evilly assume that is just due to a gradual and gradual narrowing of arteries or something like that but it's it strikes me that that's very unlikely the case and that it's much more related to something within capillaries and or other metrics because you know paradoxically as we age we're seeing an increase in our blood pressure typically so when you're 20 versus 60 you're generally running with a higher blood pressure so if anything you would think that should increase cerebral perfusion not decrease it but of course we're not seeing that so what do you think at the level of vascular biology would explain even that observe yes unfortunately the answer is all of the bulb in other words the vascular changes happened at the macroscopic and microscopic levels but it is the case if you for example only look like we have done for example the carotid artery the one in the neck that supplies the blood to the head this is where most of the blood is going to the brain from this and you can use ultrasound imaging knowing basically and are able to look at the layers so even the intimal thickening of the carotid artery which would presumably get a little more and more and more as you want ages is gonna play a role in this potential that there is a linear relationship between what we call the intima-media thickness they lie the layers of the artery and the decline in cognitive function now while I mean this sounds silly but why in linear relationship given that it should be nonlinear shouldn't it given that with increase in intimal thickening you would see exponential change in diameter or in cross-sectional area wouldn't that lead to a nonlinear change in perfusion no which I realize you were talking about cognition fusion but not the future the reason there is not a linear change with perfusion is what you alluded to we have an outer regulatory mechanism as I get it that basically can start to autocorrect at least try to dam in it dampens it from an exponential problem to a linear problem that's a beautiful beautiful example of biology so has has the artery becomes stiffer with the thicker walls he's just like if you imagine somebody having a hose that is releasing water and then you stick your finger in front of the hose and you can see how the water is coming in a faster plate so this is one aspect that but this is the outer regulation the body's trying to achieve that it does that when the walls becomes stiffer because of their thickening when you have this systolic pump that they're supposed to comply for arterial compliance they don't do that so even though you may see the lumen being the same size in other words the hole being the same size but it's not the same size when you have the pulse the bottles of blood going through that he has to open up however when we increase blood pressure we have a constant process of trying to increase blood pressure to maintain that same level of perfusion these now leads to problems with the capillaries because these capillaries so the compensation for the macro vascular disease may actually be driving part of the damage at the micro vascular you're pushing now with a higher blood pressure through capillaries and these creates a pathology and this boundary we call the endothelial walls and these endothelial walls are now subjected to mechanical pressures that they were not designed to do and you have extravasation and you have cells and normally are only engage when we have like a hemorrhage like the platelets to try to coagulate now they start sticking to these endothelial walls and compromising some of the micro circulation as a consequence so they the outer regulation cannot compensate it and it creates additional problems as time goes by and that's why you are actually better off with less blood pressure by controlling your hypo pressure than with more even though you're trying to make up for the decreased blood supply and this has actually been borne out in very recent clinical trials every five years or so we see more and more data revising how we think about blood pressure regulation and the most recent results seem to indicate the best outcomes occur with a systolic blood pressure below 120 millimeters per mercury a diastolic below 80 formerly this used to be 135 ish over 90 was accepted so that's a significant difference because many people walk around many adults walk around with a blood pressure above 120 over 80 you're right and and that is an index of this pathology that is developing in the large arteries like in the carotid here but I'm using the karateka as an example when this happens at the level the carotid if you know what's happening at the vertebral arteries and into the

[01:02:26] Circle of Willis and the main basically is happening more in the arteries that have the largest flow because we get like about 1/3 of the blood going into the head for the primary for the brain function so there is a much more blood flow that is going through those arteries then they want for example going to your arm your brachial artery however in the case of the heart the same thing happens you have this small coronary arteries they're feeding the heart itself as soon as you he pumps so they have greater flows and the other thing that happens these walls are only thicker but they become irregular especially the inner walls are no longer smooth and when they are no longer smooth you start creating turbulence that is if you look at the flow of liquid when they hit an irregularity in the walls there is a little turbulence so these turbulence creates a system in which deposition is gonna be favored like when blood is going or in the blood the is usually the white blood cells is it usually a macrophage that infiltrates as well yes but even before infiltrating they identify this area of turbulence as an area of up the venturi injury and a star I agree I hit him there and because of the turbulence cells they start then dying out against the walls and unfortunately cholesterol levels then can add to it but they are not the problem the high total cholesterol is not the reason again they're confusing causality here with a consequence of this problem so lowering your total cholesterol is not gonna really make a major difference in this progression which is I think one of the biggest misconception that is happening in medicine right now but in any case you have a number of phenomena that are taking place that are contributing to the rescuer hypoperfusion on the other hand you can have a similar type of insult to the brain not coming from this address chlorotic process if the heart muscle itself is compromised in his function because of a process where it weakens his ability to operate as a pump you're gonna have hypoperfusion that is gonna be developing and in that case there will even be less likely that you're gonna have an outer regulatory mechanism for that so you can have heart disease that is affected the pumping you know the the force of the pump that can lead to the high perfusion you can have arterial disease like arteries currency that is causing similar kind of phenomenon with some more complications that are detected by this high blood pressure in the cardiac case you will not see the high blood pressure burning the other one you will see that and so all of these things can be detected it is possible for cardiologists to advance and measure these things and once you detect is the health of the heart and the arterial circulation in particular is very closely related to the health of the brain so if whatever you do that improves cardiovascular health will also help the brain but there are some differences for example the brain in some ways seems a little bit more exposed because the brain is perfused during systole at a higher pressure the heart is the only organ that is actually perfused during diastole so in that sense the coronary arteries themselves are less susceptible to hypertension than the arteries in the brain or the kidney for that matter which would be the two organs that seem to be most damaged by hypertension more so than the heart yes the other thing that I'm hearing you say that creates a bit of a differentiation between the heart is you know in the process of atherosclerosis and the heart cholesterol does play a very important role but so you still have the initiation of the endothelial injury which is necessary but once the lipoprotein can get inside the sub endothelial space and becomes oxidized that's what elicits the immune response which is what does the damage which you're describing in the brain is two different processes if I'm hearing you correctly the first is cerebral vascular disease that leads to strokes occlusive or hemorrhagic which that's a separate disease because it tends to produce an acute event goreck that is the result of an acute hypoperfusion that usually produces a much more functional deficit so it's almost like you can think of that as a quote-unquote brain attack the way we think of a heart attack correct but what you're describing that is now sort of unique to me is a different type of much more indolent chronic hypoperfusion that actually seems to have a slightly different pathophysiology from coronary physiology yes that doesn't produce an acute event but rather a chronic disease is that and I did I summarized that you summarized that really well it is this chronic brain hypoperfusion regardless of the particular cardiovascular cause because I told you with heart failure you can have you can simulate that aspect but without some of the other components right so it is possible nowadays to pick this up and to intervene to try to resolve this vascular problems or cardiovascular they involve the heart so the epidemiology states the first and most obvious relationship which is so obvious that it's not almost not helpful which is there is no greater association with

[01:08:20] Alzheimer's disease than age just as there is no greater association with cardiovascular disease than age so that's stating the obvious but it's very difficult to draw a clear hypothesis or at least confirm a hypothesis so the next layer of thinking on the epidemiology is what is it the association with hypertension or is it the association with cardio metabolic disease how do you then continue down that line of thinking on from just just again before we get to the more interesting stuff which i think is the

[01:08:51] Sala G and the pharmacology just based on epidemiology what else can you infer what would be ideal to me will be what is the main purpose of that circulation from the point of view of energy is to bring oxygen to the tissues tissue oxygenation it is only to this process of reducing oxygen to water that in mitochondrial this process is linked this cellular respiration is linked to the production of chemical energy so the more direct measurements would be measurements of oxygen consumption but also could be the enzyme that is responsible for that oxygen consumption and that's where it comes to our work and what we found in the brains of those

[01:09:44] Alzheimer patients we found that the enzyme called cytochrome oxidase or cytochrome C obviously the complex for in the electron transport chain the electron transfer is the the last trail the last and the rate-limiting enzyme and the one that actually reduces oxygen to water that is linked to oxidative phosphorylation the creation of ATP let's pause for a moment to make sure people understand this it's so important that even though I think I've talked about this before it's worth reiterating the mitochondria has an inner and outer membrane and these have four complexes three of them span both the internetter membrane what believe it's one three and four complex two is only on the inner membrane these things are about the most essential elements of life interrupting their activity for even moments at a time is the end of life I would say is the key to I had öbut life on the planet yeah you can't overstate the importance of the electron transport chain as you pointed out it is basically yeah we can't create energy out of nothing we simply change its form and so when we eat food we're eating stored potential energy that is in a chemical form that is generally between the carbon carbon carbon hydrogen bonds as these things get reduced to simple and simpler molecules this specifically within the mitochondria takes these units and it by breaking apart the chemical bonds creates an electrical gradient by shuttling electrons outside of this membrane as they go from complex one to three and of course they each come with their own reducing agents I spend my most time thinking about complex one George is the nadh nad shuttle but I believe complex 4 is NADPH isn't it is that what it's using is the electron acceptor donor yes

[01:11:36] I I need to emphasize from what you're saying so people understand the whole purpose of that chemistry that is done with the foods that we eat is to generate electron donors electron donors are gonna donate their electrons to the electron transport and there are only two of them the NADH and the faad age and the NADH primarily it donates to different parts of the electron transport system but the other one the

[01:12:08] FTA age only too complex too so you have like two entry points complex 1 and 2 and then that's why complex 2 doesn't spend a full membrane it's sort of sitting there only on the end it's much smaller than complex one is the largest one so this is a key this is about chemical key to this phenomenon because what we eat from an energy point of view he just become an electron donor so is can we donate electrons to the electron transport if we could do that we can accelerate respiration because they ultimate electron gas sector in nature is oxygen and that's what we call oxidation the process of removing electrons and so making in water out of out of oxide of oxygen and these protons that are being donated is the ultimate byproduct of respiration that's why we breathe out water vapor and of course all of this is in service of creating an electron gradient to then fuel the generation of adenosine triphosphate ATP yes what they mitochondria have done is coupling this affinity of oxygen to take these electrons that are coming from the food that we eat into system in which the electrons when they are moving from one complex to the other they are releasing what is called a proton there is positively charged and this is trap in that inter membrane between the two membranes that you mentioned the outer and the inner one and the matrix of the mitochondria the more inner portion is primarily negative in electrical charge ions are negative so these protons are trying to move they are attracted towards this negativity just like when you have the poles in in a magnet the positive and the negative pole this is what we call electro-motive force there are only very few forces in nature like gravitation and this one is electro-motive force so the system was designed in such a way that the protons will leak through a hole and that hole or pore is this complex v and complex v is designed so that when it the proton is pushing through to get from the inner excuse me from better inter inter membrane space to the matrix it clicks changes the confirmation of that enzyme and that movement generates the energy for a phosphate to be bound to ADP and the phosphate will inorganic phosphate when this is what in chemistry is called an endothermic reaction in its energy in order to happen and it's because the movement and then later on when you need some other enzyme to work all of these chemical reactions I have to do with life are catalyzed or mediated by enzymes what this means is that you may have the reactants already in place but nothing is gonna happen in terms of products unless you provide energy to the system so these are so-called reaction that when you remove that phosphate from the ATP it generates it and this is what we call calorie and you can then have a relationship a quantitative relationship with how much food you eat how many electrons are donated how many of these phosphates can be broken and generate the heat and that heat is just like in chemistry when you have your reactants in a in a beaker and you have a catalyst and nothing was happening and then you apply heat and then all the salting and reaction happens it changes color for example and when that phenomenon happens then we call that an exothermic reaction that break it and he feels so the key to the system is to be able how can we facilitate the mitochondrial respiration and this illustrates of course the most important point here what you're saying is the whole purpose of eating is to convert chemical energy into chemical energy from one form to another but to do it you need an intermediary to translate and that intermediate has to turn the chemical energy into electrical energy that then facilitates a conversion back to chemical energy that is the key to life yes and that is what the mitochondria do however there is a way at least aerobic Li we can obviously do this inefficiently an anaerobic Lee later but correct correct you can do these special in other tissues not so much the brain you can generate ATP without using oxygen and this machinery but every organism including single cells on the planet that uses oxygen to obtain energy relies on cytochrome oxidase they may not have mitochondria but at least they need to come on wait I didn't realize that so red blood cells for example don't have mitochondria do they have cytochrome oxidase C yes I didn't know that yes if they use oxygen to generate ATP they have to have cytochrome C and silicon C exceed ace this is the minimum requirement that's why you can look at cell lines from microbes and song and you can identify these proteins as long as it's aerobic it's the only way nature found how to solve this but the interesting thing is that when the circulation is compromised you have less oxygen you're creating a situation where these events can no move on it doesn't matter how much do you eat and this is happening older people doesn't matter how much they eat in fact their brain is telling them that they should be hungry because they are not able to train for those electron donors into the electron transport and produce energy so they feel their energy deprived so they increase food consumption especially they are attracted to carbohydrates simple carbohydrate can quickly break down and produce these electrons oh so do you think that this is the first insult then because you talked about this slightly different type of micro vascular disease that is much more chronic and insidious then doesn't lead to acute changes like hemorrhage or occlusion how does that change ultimately impact the ability of the mitochondria to do its job and facilitate electron transfer you put your finger on it this is what links this phenomenon regardless of whether the chronic hypoperfusion or the more acute one of the things that happen is when we have a hypoxia situation cytochrome oxidase is an inducible enzyme what that means is that our body only maintains as much as is needed as much as is demanded is a complex of 13 different subunits three of them mitochondrial DNA derive and the other time from nuclear DNA and you can regulate it at many different levels including both the nucleus or mitochondria but essentially within minutes if for example you have an area of ischemia you occlude the blood vessel half an hour later you'd lost a significant amount of cytochrome oxidase from B and that's irreversible then no it is not it reversible that's the the advantage of the system the system works on the main it may not be immediately reversible depends on on the level of regulation in other words you can simply inhibit the enzyme and the enzyme is still there or you can disassemble the catalytic units of the enzyme the ones from

[01:20:02] Cornell origin and then you have a partial M sign not this whole holoenzyme or you can eliminate the other components and throughout the mitochondrial in a membrane you have all these variations of a stages that can be used for regulating this so you can regulate in a more immediate way or eventually you need you know proteins transported from the cytoplasm to be cheap or the mitochondria are and incorporate into this why was this done because mitochondria have a symbiotic relationship with the cells that they live on and this was created to develop a dependency the mitochondria are doing this but they cannot do it on their own the cell has found a way to obtain the energy but is conditional on them contributing a component that is necessary for the entire machinery to work the important portion here is that these phenomena are coupled as soon as you have hypoxia it's came here you reduce then this machinery goes down regulated is that true of complex one two three as well are they also inducible the way complex four is not as much as conflict for they are to certain degree if you keep taxing the system it's going to happen but the one that has the more flexibility from more immediate to long-term because of this role has really limiting is complex for and that's the reason it is preferred model later of the system that's why I love doing these podcasts every single podcast I get to learn something new in biology that I didn't know I had no idea that complex four was inducible to a greater extent on the others has it ease for example you may have her for sure during your training about all the usable in science yes of course the cytochrome systems yes in the liver so the labor is p450 the people so it's a perfect example you know if you have more talk if you drink more alcohol you're gonna build up more of these cytochrome enzyme so these are the most inducible in somatic complexes that we have you just never think of it in something so important not that the liver is less important of course but the e.t.c is so fundamental for everything that we do it's so interesting to think of that and it's also interesting to hear you say that at least in transient periods of ischemia this is not irreversible no he's not reversible is an inducible citizen just like your stops like delivers you thinking alcohol these enzymes are gonna be down regulated but if you start challenging the system ain't they they are inducible they're gonna go back of course you're gonna suffer somewhat in between because at the beginning you're not gonna be able to meet the demand but it they aren't useful and this is the key that I have understood from our investigation of the Alzheimer's brain in those fresh frosting Alzheimer's reign the main problem was cytochrome oxidase innovation the levels of the protein levels of the EM sighs were not compromised but you could see that the enzyme was not in his catalytic functional state and you could demonstrate these doing enzyme histo chemistry if you were able to extract at the moment those patients died their cells in culture and now they're perfused would they have still been hypo functioning in other words would you still have been able to measure a deficit of oxygen utilization yes yes and and this has been done groups have taken actually what they taking is mitochondria and they can then see that these mitochondria are not performing this cellular respiration from

[01:23:52] Alzheimer's patients give me a sense of what is the magnitude of the deficit to result in the phenotype that we observe clinically yes this is a very good question because if you inhibit cytochrome oxidase after about 40 percent in in an organism the organism dies you cannot cut B this is as but presumably it's a nomogram of duration and degree of suppression right so maybe you could have a 40 percent reduction for two seconds but oh okay but not a 40 percent reduction for two minutes or something I mean I assume that's correct for example the classic poison cyanide okay what the cyanide does cyanide is complex for a cytochrome oxidase inhibitor it gets into the circulation getting here is cytochrome oxidase and minutes later did you die so if that happens is not compatible to life however you can have many degrees of this reduction because the enzyme is so inducible you not only change the catalytic activity of a particular word cyanide is not binary in its ability to kill it seems functionally binary because it's so potent that even a trace amount of cyanide will kill but presumably if you dilute it enough and enough enough you could give enough cyanide to somebody that they have a chronic illness would you it almost like it's a thought experiment you could induce Alzheimer's had a low enough dose of cyanide to create a functional hypoperfusion Yai inhibiting complex 4 without killing the organism and we did this I like when I think of things 10 years please thought experiment was dawn and in fact dr. Jack dilatory the one that wrote the book Alzheimer's turning point that I highly recommend yeah will link to that for sure and we collaborated in their study so it works both ways in other words if you compromise the circulation by partially occluding blood vessels to the brain you get a down regulation of cytochrome oxidase and therefore mitochondrial respiration and ATP production and so on and the animals whole cognitive picture that is analogous it's not the same or it's analogous to what you see in cognitive never never cognitive disorders and the only way around you can directly suppress the electron transport and in our solid we decided to use sodium azide because it's less potent than cyanide and when you do that yes you have an animal that are a very low level of decreasing you can decrease up to 30% without seeing any neurological evidence change the animals appear to be eating and behaving normally but when you test than we kinda need memory tears they cannot perform well in other words a 30% reduction in the oxidative capacity of complex four shows cognitive impairment when challenged even though behaviorally at the gross motor level the energy are still fine just like an Alzheimer's patient that you will appear they will appear to be generally okay until you test the system for us yes so these animals and in fact that was proposed as a model for Alzheimer's disease it's that very same approach by colleagues of mine the one that comes mine it's pros

[01:27:17] Bennett rose and Bennett however because of the influence of these amyloid and tangles hypothesis all of these models were based on biochemical and physiological phenomena were really not developed fully all the attention was in you know the genes and the product normal proteins but yes you can do this in animals you can test these hypotheses in animals and does this lead to any change in the amount let's assume you had an Android model where you could do this for a long enough period of time before the animal would die and you had a control animal in which it was you were not doing this would you in those two situations side by side see a difference in amyloid beta accumulation no the amyloid beta would not be a good reflection of these processes the amyloid beta is primarily a process that is compensatory when the cells are showing atrophy so when cells are showing signs of atrophy we have a lot of amyloid beta that is released embryonic lis during the development of the nervous system and it's because during development of the nervous system you have faces of a large proliferation of neurons but then you have other phases of dreaming where there is a lot of neuronal death and in those situations there you see amyloid that is formed so as you know probably the major signal for a cell to die in anaerobic organism is for the mitochondria to release cytochrome C cytochrome C is a protein that carries the electron to cytochrome C oxidase if that machinery is not working and cytochrome C leaks out we say they mitochondrial permeability poor has been modified so that small cytochrome C leaks that's a big signal for apoptosis apoptosis or programmed cell death in other words if a cell might occur that's the surrender of the cell that's the white flag here's my cytochrome C so so what I'm telling you is if you compromise the system you're gonna happen out of the generation you're gonna have cell death and not just in the nervous system it just happens that there is more critical because in all the systems we have all the ways to get

[01:29:37] ATP but in neurons we don't have any significant amount of alternative ways to get it yeah that's exactly the point I was gonna make is we're having this discussion and it would be easy for a moment to say Wow why is this all isolated to the brain it's not it's just the brain I think has two problems the fir you know if you're gonna be critical at the brain the first is an energetic problem which is it is simply the most demanding and therefore it is the most susceptible to a reduction in total available energy the brain weighs about two percent of our body weight and yet consumes about 20% of our total energy expenditure so that's a grossly disproportionate amount of energy and the second by the way would be the kidney which by the way is the second organ we tend to see great ischemic when we see hypoperfusion clinically we see kidney damage and myocardial damage so the more energy demanding the organ the bigger the problem and then the second issue with the brain is this seemingly over-reliance on oxidative phosphorylation without an anaerobic escape route yes you are right on target and this is what makes it so vulnerable and this is why we see these changes more has cognitive deficit before all the tissues are really damaged or the brain itself but as you continue with this process that we just talked about if down regulation of cytochrome hoxsey reach certain level cytochrome C is can start release there is a this permeability change goes out and cells are dying so it is the the direction of causality is completely different from the amyloid ideas that the amyloid comes there because of the gene that is abnormal and then it creating this cascades that are leading to these changes know what we have it's his problems with supply of oxygen that happen to the brain and it's high energetic demand and they could be due to the circulation or a be due to a cardiac effect on the circulation but unfortunately the best cooler hypothesis of the manger is not exclusionary because you can have toxic insults that affect the mitochondria the world for all physiological purposes will do something similar to this cardiovascular insults in other words they're gonna lead also to down regulation of cytochrome oxidase and your inability to use oxygen to generate energy so that's why I have used that entry point into the system because it is completely consistent with the vascular hypothesis of dementia but it also provides room for other insults the brain that are gonna be reflected at the level and East only when they're reflected at the level that end a because this energetic demand is vulnerability that you alluded to that then this is gonna lead to a cognitive why a cognitive problem and not something else because when we are engaged in these functions that is playing we these functions are not limited to one region of the brain they're relied on interaction between different regions so when you're reading something that information goes to racial system but then if you're gonna engage learning having to do with that they would engage or the system so the memory functions are more distributed so when you have a more distributed metabolic insult they're gonna be affected it's just like people know somebody may get a blow to the head and then all the sudden they may have retrograde amnesia they may not remember what happened the memory will remember who they are and you may not see any significant level structural or functional damage but you affected the way the systems were interacted in a more global way so this is one of the reasons we detect this primarily as a memory problem initially well later on it becomes a neurodegenerative disorder when when cells cannot longer work without this mitochondrial machinery so we have any insight into how much might hoffa G or itopf eg a toffee G is going on in the later stages of Alzheimer's disease in other words is it possible that so much of this damage is now due to defective cleaning up of the mitochondria because the more these mitochondria are damaged the more mitochondrial DNA is getting released the mitochondrial DNA itself is actually looks bacterial so it elicits an immune response this probably accelerates the process it would seem that anything that would increase my toffee jhiera Tov AG would at least be able to curb the progression of the feed-forward loop on this damage going and accelerating wouldn't it yes makes sense I agree however is too late if you already compromised the machinery for obtaining the energy is too late at that point so my focus on the focus of Jack dilatory and other people is how can we intervene for example one way is in the risk factors they have to do with the cardiovascular compromised try to intervene with the risk factors besides blood pressure what do you view is the most important risk factors then

[01:35:10] I sing at Rose chlorosis is a really important risk factor and the major blood vessels you indicated like the carotid the ascending aorta and their renal arteries they are the large blood vessel are the the main targets of these are drug lord processes especially the bifurcation points the other factors that I would see there will be generalized travel month to the brain yeah I was gonna ask you about this this seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to chronic traumatic encephalopathy where the difference is if you're a football player or a boxer you have repeated short bouts of hypoxia it appears from my reading of the literature that every time you're getting hit in the head you're having a transient interruption of blood flow and also it appears based on at least the animal models we're seeing transient insulin resistance at the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase so a blow to the head will transiently make it harder for pyruvate to turn into acetyl co a which is the opening substrate in the graph cycle in the Krebs cycle and so while the patients we're describing who presumably let's just make math simple and say they never get a concussion or a hit in the head they have this chronic insidious disease process the athletes who are suffering this type of injury are getting punctuated by spike functions of these and it doesn't have to be a concussion every time it could be each play on the field or something like that do you think there's an overlap in these processes completely this is what's called dementia put realistic originally and often nowadays this is confused with Alzheimer's disease and

[01:37:00] Parkinson's disease in the case of Parkinson is because when with the blows to the head there is a rapid twisting of the head when you get a blow to the head a rapid twisting bending of the head with respect to the neck and that's an angular momentum that usually causes that injury and this affects the midbrain and the upper bring a stem and actually that's what leads to the knockout that would feed more into a parkinsonian phenotype in the midbrain and you Sinagra isolating that region is more vulnerable for this but it is the same phenomenon all of these forms of dementia will have a common denominator at some point regardless of the many different ways that you can impact the system the most likely common denominator will be at the level of the mitochondrial risk and therefore another way for example the circulation may not be a good target for narrow trauma but if you find a way to facilitate mitochondrial respiration even if there is compromise hypoperfusion or some other condition and this is what I've been working on for many years and once we discovered that the main problem in the Alzheimer's brain had to do with this inhibition of cytochrome oxidase we set out to how can we intervene is there any way and and you have to intervention that you have now coupled that both work on cytochrome C but in a slightly different way yes cytochrome C oxidase cytochrome C is the carrier and suffer from C oxidase the large bit large complex yeah thank you for clarifying so the first one I use a pharmacological approach because I was more familiar with those approaches but

[01:38:48] I couldn't do it with regular most of what is called narrow pharmacology or psychopharmacology is really aim at narrow transmission three sectors and agonists and antagonists what's needed here something is acting at the level of mitochondrial respiration and previewing all literature from the 1960s I found out that methylene blue come on really use compounds in the lab was able to act as a electron donor and depending on the conditions but if you make in a very low concentration it acts as an electron cycler you will donate but you also get electrons from other compounds and it would continue to feed into the electron transport as an alternate route and in fact if you block for example complex one we're rotting on that you're interested still the electron transport can proceed going through methylene blue as a bypass because in a normal organism complete blocking of complex one would be fatal you're saying with a high enough concentration of methylene blue you can still get electrons past the bottleneck of complex we can preventing animal moral degeneration we shown this in many preparations with fur seal in the retina because it was more accessible and we could manipulate that locally as a model of the brain and then within the brain so so this has an interesting history right there's a guy named Paul Ehrlich who studies this right the only reason I remember this is one of my heroes really yeah well I remem and so there's an expression balls-to-the-wall which means like going very very fast all-out and and most people don't realize but it just refers to a governor and a train where the governor the faster that the train was going these balls that were hanging on you know basically cables would move further and further out as the centrifugal force goes and once they touch the wall that's the mechanism that would regulate the speed and slow it down but there's another expression that comes from erlik's work which is is it a magic bullet magic bullet and he referred to medellin blue as a magic bullet and early to poll early he worked and in berlin berlin germany and he was able to be part of a very progressive group at the time and before world war ii this was him yeah this is actually this in the late 1800s no no this isn't the late 1880 86 he was working on this and he injected at that time was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the first thing in the Industrial

[01:41:28] Revolution that was developed where the textiles being able to manufacture clothing and one of the important change was a transition from using natural products for dyes to develop chemists developing synthetic dyes and actually Germany led this process and methylene blue was one of these synthetic dyes blue dye and for many decades it was a blue dye I use in blue jeans and most of the other blue clothing so one of the things that intrigued Paul Ehrlich was that he injected methylene blue one of these new synthetic dyes into a la live rat and then he detected the animal after killing the enemy detected the animal and he found out that the methylene blue this was a large concentration intravenous injection was primarily staining nervous tissue the brain and peripheral nervous issue so he created the concept there of a magic bullet this is a chemical that remember this in the 1880s this is a chemical that I'm giving systemically yet it is somehow finding his way to the nervous system and it's becoming trapped there as you can see by this thing later this phenomenon was called super vital or vital staining and it works exploited for example by santiago ramon akahl one of my other heroes during this time he referred to this as the early reaction to be able to stay in nervous tissue when the animal was alive but what does it mean the animal being alive the animal respiring the animal using oxygen so methylene blue they didn't know this but methylene blue has affinity for these redox reactions that are happening in a maximized way inside the mitochondria in the electron transport chain and at specially a low concentrations it becomes trap for periods of hours inside mitochondria it can work as a mitochondrial stain does it become toxic at a high what does it toxic like at a higher dose at a higher dose instead of acting as an electron cycler it actually replaces oxygen in the you know it competes with oxygen remember that I told you oxygen was the one that was taking the electrons so he can be you wanted to have it in a low concentration that is giving electrons and taking electrons are the same rate but you're saying at a higher dose it becomes a proton acceptor little yes because it competes with oxygen and it oxidizes the tissues and actually that was in part the first application that early found for methylene blue so that's interesting because the only time obviously that

[01:44:25] I've ever seen it used as for treating met him of anemia in the emergency room so someone is exposed to carbon monoxide you know acutely or even chronically over long a period of time this basically breaks it apart so there you actually wanted to sort of out-compete oxygen a little bit right is that yes yes you know what is happening there in the carbon monoxide occupies they in the heme molecule the pocket were normally oxygen that's on so you actually wanted a competitor yeah you wanted to build and get the carbon monoxide out that will displace it and maintain in blue will do that but because you do this infusion so methylene blue can be used to prevent or rescue you from methemoglobinemia this inability to mine the oxygen but a higher concentration it induces met immigrant Amy yes the same compound so this is typical of all of these redox chemicals that I studied they have this they have bimodal functional joints we call this I facing dose response or hormetic dose-response --is essentially they do the opposite effects low and high concentrations now the color the other if someone's listening to this they'll remember the high school chemistry class how do you demonstrate this to your students yes well when you add the powder of methylene blue into water the water becomes very blue and then if you use a reducing agent and I use vitamin C ascorbic acid because it's a effective reducing agent but it's harmless when the methylene blue is reduced it becomes transparent reducing meaning it's accepting protons yes it's no longer acting has oxygen so when you'll turn that vial clear clear and this is then you refer to it as Loco methylene blue loco actually comes like the same route like leukocytes the white blood cells yes so you call it the Loco methylene blue that refers to the methylene blue being in the reduce state as opposed to the oxidized state there is the blue so methylene blue had major advantages one of the cosmetic disadvantage is that once he goes through this process that I explained that becoming trapped that was discovered by early to becoming trapped in the nervous tissue so he has affinity for nervous tissue inside mitochondria eventually it's really goes back into the circulation it takes half-life of our 12 hours with a dose that is a low dose that produces this redox benefit so it concentrates in the urine in the bladder and actually here in the US for decades before the antibiotics were available if you had a urinary bladder infection you who took methylene blue pills the methylene blue pills will start increasing the concentration of methylene blue inside the bladder until he became a pro-oxidant while it was there and he'd eliminated any bacteria or virus in a known specific manner and he was a very effective more effective way to eliminate urinary bladder infection for example older people have chronic problems that they go through round after round of antibiotics that they validate them or create resistance you could use nasty limb blue and is it because the methylene blue would add a dose that was not toxic to the human once it concentrates in the bladder it increases its concentration and therefore is toxic to the organism will become oxidative and they would be toxic for it oh so is it a Ross induced injury to the bacteria that all right so you dead your basic or after the mitochondria of the bacteria yes yes it does the opposite but it does it to the microorganisms that are inside the bladder they're producing the infection so he has the potential to do this in all the situation but here naturally concentrates there so that provides the advantage but there are many things about methylene blue hood I would not go into but air rich in self determined that the pen aside that produces malaria the Plasmodium falciparum had a name sign that was particularly vulnerable to not much large concentrations of metal blue were enough to affect the same time so Madeleine blue became the first for a long time their only treatment for malaria and this was a major breakthrough in in medical research was in fact the first synthetic chemical used for a medicinal application in the history of medicine and pharmacology was methylene blue and all of the first synthetic medicines were derivatives of methylene blue including in particular the late 1940s early 1950s the developing of chlorpromazine the first psycho pharmacological agent that was used for psychosis or what we call not schizophrenia in those days they will call it the main shipwreck cause because they were thinking that it was the same kind of dementia that was happening the older people happen in the Jang people now we make a separation between dimensions schizophrenia but promising is a methylene blue derivative and in fact there are reports as far as nineteen thirty's of physicians giving methylene blue mixes the problem was that in the original way the methylene blue was synthesized for textiles there were lot of intermediary products as a result of the synthesis and some of these were likely or promising so they were seeing and dizygotic effects from giving these methylene blue preparations as I found reports in the 1930s and 1940s and then they was picked up by pharmaceutical company and by the end of the 1940s they developed promising has the first anti-psychotic medication and that would change completely the face of psychiatry and it may have just been simply a chemical contaminant / intermediary contaminant within them from the assimilation of for the same disease so they thought the benefit was methylene blue it was actually from a byproduct within and they'd these go over what they by brother wass which is such a great story of chemistry in general right how easy it is to be fooled by something that you know seemingly makes sense now today the only

[01:51:05] FDA indication to my knowledge for methylene blue is is met him were ranked yes I mean there's a clinical trials that are going on to study this yeah let me clarify that because what happened is that Madeleine blue was being available for 120 years plus so methylene blue was grandfather by the FDA it preceded the creation of the FDA so the FDA has not been able to resolve well how they deal with this grandfather drugs being the first synthetic drug available so he was used for many things and I'm gonna go into all of them but malaria was probably the most important one until some Spanish and French explorers in South America discovered from the bark of the tree Queen 9 and then that happening he became the next generation after Madeleine blue nowadays they're bringing back the methylene blue especially in Africa because they're the

[01:52:07] Plasmodium has become resistant to wings so they are combining it so there's a comeback for methylene blue in that respect so it is used medicinally for that but the FDA never really got to have a saying on it so what you're referring to is what has survived in the what is called the u.s. pharmacopoeia these companions of medications with indications and in the US for my Copiah that indication of methylene blue for methemoglobinemia has survived some of the others has been removed like I told you for urinary bladder infections when the antibiotics became available but it's being used to protect the brain you mention cancer early before we started the interview many of the drugs that I use for chemotherapy have side effects that affect the brain in particular mitochondrial respiration so methylene blue given before or during chemotherapy interventions have been found to be life-saving one example is one called ifosfamide so

[01:53:18] I fought for my induce encephalopathy happens in this chemo therapy and there are many papers on these however the problem is the FDA will not acknowledge these uses because there is no pharmaceutical company who is bringing these materials I guess this is sort of an impossible situation to understand because the FDA can't really consider the approval for an agent or a use without an investigational new drug filing an IND there is no IND I assume for methylene blue because there's no economics in methylene blue yeah there is no company that wants to embarrass because it's not patentable they cannot protect their with a patent so anybody can manufacture methylene blue and prescribe it or use it in some countries like Canada it's freely available here in the US isn't clear what is the status is but you can get it through the internet the problem is there are two problems one you have different purities so you have at least three categories of purities for methylene blue the one that should be used by in humans like in them they for in emergency room it is called pharmaceutical quality or the US we call

[01:54:40] USP grade the Europeans have a similar but the one day the USP is actually more restraint than the European medium blue then there is chemical quality that is using laboratory for staining but that can go over for example the one produced by Sigma as about 15 percent impurities it should not be given to live animals or humans and is readily available so I always one warn against that and in many experiments with animals they use that

[01:55:12] Sigma product so we don't know for confounding the results of the experiments with the impurities and impurities are very toxic he has led he has mercury has cadmium he has a number of neurotoxic impurities and then the other one is even less pure is the industrial color the genes to color the blue genes and other things and that is even more than 15 percent impurity and nobody knows which now there was a company in Scotland several years ago that ran a compound LM

[01:55:43] TM and the trial which was announced results of this trial were announced about two years ago and it was a big hoopla because the study which I went back and skimmed the other day because I knew we would probably I was hoping we would talk about this the study basically took patients in early stages of dementia randomized them to various interventions but one of them was this agent this LM TM which they described as a methylene blue derivative I don't know how far a derivative it was it might have been not much of a derivative it's essentially you remember what I told you

[01:56:16] I added ascorbic acid yeah and he was methylene blue so they don't something like this they have reduced methylene blue but they don't use the name methylene blue they use the name of Mathilde Giannini own chloride which is more chemical name and that's where the MT comes and then the L is for the leuco because it's clear it comes and is used for me that's the form that is in the peel as soon as it's in the body it's oxidized it starts these redox cycles and those patients did void blue oh yes so it is clear that he's doing the redox cycles now what was very controversial about this was the primary endpoint of that study was a neuro imaging outcome and the primary output failed there was no difference on neuroimaging there was a secondary outcome on cognitive function and in a subgroup analysis which again the statisticians will say that's you they cry foul right and understandable you can't start parsing the data and I agree yes and but the argument was the subset in which this benefit was seen which was about 15% and if I recall it was only patients that received the LM TM in mono therapy so what we don't know unfortunately because this to me left a lot of questions unanswered right it certainly suggested there's something going on with methylene blue but are we being misled because the combination of methylene blue with other drugs obfuscates the results i I think that's the most likely yeah do you think that's the most likely yes however let me clarify these individuals have never presented methylene blue or on this tooth methylene blue from the point of view that are being presented to you as a metabolic enhancer or it could be metabolic poison too but in local drivers the low concentrations as a metabolic enhancer acting on the mitochondrial respiration they can have been present in these as an ante tau medication that's correct the entire company with whose name I forget now yes go tau it had how in the name yes X yeah yeah that's the other thing that interested me which way bothers ease is completely wrong they might have backed into something interesting potentially yes and I say this here publicly it is unfortunate that they have done this this way because they are undermining the potential benefits of methylene blue they came is always behind the hypothesis are not gonna name he found that in vitro relatively large concentrations - based on what I'm telling you about mitochondrial respiration it prevented the phosphorylation and agglutination of tau in vitro so they then infer oh this is an auntie tau aging if you test methylene blue with mediate different compounds depending on the concentration of methylene blue because it has producing or an oxidative action it will interfere with all kinds of phenomena there is nothing specific about me this may be true true and unrelated its effect on tau whether correct or incorrect may not actually matter and not only that they affect it's those dependent in other words in B throw the more concentration Madeline blue had you the more you interfere with the tau aggregation in other words you don't see this bimodal dose response no because they were actually working on the high end of concept so that does that mean they weren't even looking to see what the toxicity was in the mitochondria when they did the initial work they did some later work that to address this when they wanted to move this to the FDA but the point is in the first studies from this group the most effective dose was the lowest dose and it was in the mono therapy group no no this was before that stuff okay before that Stoli there your side oh this is the phased that was the first solid one in the first study they found some effect with the very low dose and in the higher doses that would approximate this anti telefax they found no effects and they turned this around in such a way that in one of the papers published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease that friend of mine is the editor they claimed that actually the highest dose there was a problem with adsorption and he's really was really hello those and the load lowest those was more easily absorbed and it was really then they hide those and then they changed the result to indicate all the low dose was the high and the high dose was low and that's why work so in other words they did not change their hypothesis that was contradicted by their data which is the same thing that's been happening with the amyloid people their results do not support the hypothesis and they keep blindly moving forward so now what you explained was because they have difficulties getting a patent for this compound they created this reduced version of methylene blue and it's similar studies but in that study they had the problem that the majority of the people if you are having

[02:01:59] Alzheimer's disease and you're in a hospital or being treated by usually a neurologist or sometimes like a dress they would prescribe unfortunately unfortunately drugs that have no benefit through the patients but use verse effects such as calling histories inhibitors and memantine and the idea being is well this is the standard of care it would be quote unquote unethical to take these patients off these agents even to allow them to enter another trial well that may be the reasoning that some people may have but that's actually the opposite or what's happening these drugs are ineffective and he's unethical to continue to use these ineffective dolls that are having this toxic and birth effects on people if you go back to the original studies that were used by the FDA to approve these drugs and the reviews that were done subsequently by like the crocheting groups meta-analysis they all conclude very clearly that these drugs are ineffective and they do not improve activities of daily living and that the disease continues and progress and people die in fact in countries were they have more elaborate longitudinal data like in the UK of administration of these compounds to patients with

[02:03:22] Alzheimer's they know that they die sooner if they're taking these medications that the ones are refused to take them and the UK made an attempt in fact they banned these compounds because they had evidence base they're not only they were ineffective but they were counterproductive and within a year the public demanded to the politicians because if they are used in the US they must be beneficial and so this is a decision that was not politically motivated to bring them back and make them available even though we we have all the evidence just like we have against the amyloid report is that they call energy hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is also irrelevant I actually it's funny I didn't realize people still subscribe to that hypothesis the most commonly prescribed medications are they calling histories inhibitors and then the FDA did not approve memantine for early Alzheimer's or mild Alzheimer's or my cognitive impairment approval originally only for severe and then later for moderate and severe which was very unfortunate the memantine is preventing some of the exciter toxicity that is damaging those hypo Campbell cells but it's actually what you're doing when when you do that you are rescuing from dying a cell that is functionally incompetent yeah so indirectly which is interesting because there was a study that came out about a month and a half ago on memantine and I remember you know this is obviously not my field of expertise so I my level of knowledge and the literature is so much less than other areas but the the problem with that could be that you're actually rescuing a cell that's gonna go on to send a signal that could cause more damage down the line it is completely counterproductive and it's based on the pathology but all you oriented that you can see more of these neurons there when the people die but it's not a functional assay in other words it's a neuro pathological which there's there's value in these things but they it sounds like they're real overarching challenge here is triangulating between neurobiology anatomy functional signaling and then of course ultimately clinical outcomes matter more than any of these other things in the end I agree and that's what should direct all of these in the first place and it's not what's happening now I know this is a little outside of the work you do but do you have a point of view on the recent excitement around herpes simplex virus 1 have you followed that discussion no I don't have a good point of view what I can tell you it's we found another way to try to intervene with mitochondrial respiration using light in particular infrared light that can go through the tissues and the photons in the near-infrared light are absorbed by cytochrome oxidase it turns out the cytochrome oxidase that's the name Saito cell but chrome color is because of his extraordinary and it reflects all there so it's a chemical in the cell that gives color to the cell and this property of photonic exertion we have used in conjunction with the laser delivery of knee infrared light transcranial II through the forehead as a source of photons that actually oxidizes photo oxidizes cytochrome oxidase and by doing that the enzyme has more affinity that's a conformation of the enzyme that has more affinity to oxygen for oxygen consumption yeah I just pulled out a picture that will make sure we link to in the show notes that comes from one of your papers actually where it shows in the same figure a close section of the mitochondria and you can see the effective methylene blue and also the effective near-infrared light now it strikes me as interesting that you can get the wavelength just right because you have to be able to get through not just the tissue but the skull itself actually this goal is less of a problem is easier because it's porous because of the bony matrix because there is less circulation through it one of the big

[02:07:36] Brahma force that we have is hemoglobin I see so hemoglobin can absorb and reflect much of this light before it actually reaches the neurons so what we try to do is we move away from this peak of absorption so oxy and deoxyhemoglobin to one that is still can be absorbed by cytochrome oxidase - how many nanometers then we use 1064 nanometers wavelength so around a thousand which is a wavelength that is not very well study in biochemistry most of the spectrophotometer in biochemistry they do not go all the way to 1,000 there in the hundreds usually yes they usually 300 to 800 or something yes but the longer the wavelength the more heat penetrates through the tissues how do we know how safe that is I'm sure somebody listening to this is gonna say wait that sounds like microwaving my brain like haha no of course it's a different wavelength no I understand but as the sort of layperson this sounds very scary right microwaves moving the other reaction but the longer the wavelength the less energy they carry so the less they can penetrate so they cannot really penetrate inside atoms like the ones that have chor wavelengths but they are good enough to penetrate through the tissues not very deep and only about one to two percent if we do it transcranial II through the head actually goes through to the surface of the cerebral cortex once in the cerebral cortex the white matter is also a barrier so the effect of the photons is primarily in the gray matter layer of the cerebral cortex and what it does is it you donate in these photons to the electron transport so you're bypassing the electron donors by the photons are not identical to electrons but they act in the similar way in the electron transport so the photons and the electrons are very similar the difference is that the electron can carry a very small mass the photon essentially do not have mass and by providing photons to the electron transport you keep the electron transport going because these same signs engage in the redox changes and the more photons you send to cytochrome oxidase the more of the enzyme quickly goes to the oxidized conformation and that works like confirmations the one that has more affinity to bind oxygen but I don't understand how is this actually making its way systemically to the brain through a transcranial stimulation when you aim through for example the forehead it goes through the tissue and reaches the surface of the cerebral cortex and that's how it makes its ways a more localized is different from it's not a systemic administration like methylene blue and is it enough to just be able to hit the frontal cortex to create a clinical improvement without impacting the mitochondrial function deeper in the midbrain or lower part of the cortex to create a functional improvement we don't know yet about clinical especially I would not say that in summary with the degree of atrophy that many of the cyber patients have we're gonna have enough so straight there to be able to stimulate and reverse the disease so this will have we tested we clinically are there clinical trials that are going to be looking at this near-infrared light yes strategy combined with methylene blue nope not combined you don't think of these as synergistic you'd consider these separate approaches yeah I consider in separate approaches the reason for this is the following methylene blue can affect these photons of course and this is actually used nowadays for example dermatologists if you have a melanoma cancer in your skin or any other lesion they can inject methylene blue into that region and then they just shine light and they light concentrates the light into methylene blue and the methylene blue oxidizes had the same thing that you see in the bladder and he kills those cells there and is called photodynamic therapy he has many applications because if you have a virus that you have no other way to kill you can always kill it this way so this is happening even people don't know methylene blue is injected into law that is used for transfer a fusion so that you can then treat this blood with these bright lights and by photodynamic therapy kill viruses like the HIV virus or they herpes is there a difference between giving the methylene blue orally vs. intravenously this purpose specifically yes they intravenous one the first target will be the blood cells so you had to be more careful with the concentration because you don't want to promote the methi Murg Romania in other words to compete with oxygen so it seems safer to administer or yes the oral administration produces slower release and in low concentration is very safe and is like I say is being done in thousands and thousands of people for malaria and his studies being published in the last few years primarily give it to children in Africa for killing the parasites and in that case the oral ministration at the Pantages many of these Paris in the gut as well yeah you know God soul you can have the higher amounts there so going back to this broader perspective and the clear theme here is which i think is that prevention matters in fact we shouldn't be focusing so many resources on the treatment of clinically evident apparent dementia for the reasons you've discussed so now what we want to do is prevent I was going to say preventing high-risk individuals but as one of my friends who's a neurologist would say anybody with a brain is at risk so sure let's stop stratifying is who's high risk versus low risk everybody should take a preventative measure yes definitely in addition to this idea of all the things that matter in the heart so lower smoking lower blood pressure better glycemic control better management of lipoproteins etc etc is there anything that you see is unique in the brain specifically that is maybe not unique or maybe not as important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease the only one that I would say will have to do with the ketogenic diet ketogenic diet will facilitate mitochondrial respiration in a different way but these will contribute to targeting mitochondrial respiration so that the brain will benefit more than the heart the heart will benefit of course all of these tissues will benefit but because of the brain reliance on I had all week metabolism for example you alluded for example an insulin resistance one of the problems that happens as the brain ages even in normal people is that the transport of glucose is affected so even though we can increase glucose levels in the blood or what we're eating we cannot get that glucose being transported to the brain as effectively as in the jungle individuals that's why some of these studies with intranasal insulin administration show transient improvement in symptoms presumably because they're becoming resistant because now that's obviously not a long-term solution no but it illustrates a point and fortunately insulin primarily facilitates glucose transport in all the tissues older than the brain the brain actually doesn't require insulin he can boost his transport of glucose but the reason for that is that when you wake up in the morning that you have been fasting overnight whatever the levels of glucose are circulating in your blood then the brain tissue will be the only one that will be able to take that up and it's only when you have large glucose levels that then insulin is released by the pancreas and then all the tissues saying can use it can feast on it so the ketogenic diet so ketone bodies can act as an alternative source for energy in the brain and the important point is that even though glucose is a preferred so straight during aging this is compromised this uptake however the uptake of ketone bodies is not compromised therefore you could satisfy some of these nutritional requirements by adding the ketone bodies to the diet do you think it matters if a person is on a ketogenic diet or if they're on a non ketogenic diet but they supplement with exogenously tones I hope it doesn't matter as long as you have the ketone bodies available you don't require to have the ketogenic diet itself but this eventually were to be resolved empirically and there is no question that he's gonna promote mitochondrial respiration and we know as you know when we're born as infants we rely primarily for neuro function and everything else on on these ketone bodies produced by by the labor but because of the kind of lipids that we get through the mother's milk so essentially what we're trying to do is bring in somebody who is in all age to rely more on ketosis there is a process that we know exists under physiological conditions every day if we go beyond you know 12 14 hours without eating we we start generating this but it's something that we know in infancy is the primary source for the brain I didn't realize that is that more a result of their livers not being able to release enough glycogen via glucose and in pata glucose output I mean I know they have a very high demand for energy yes can you measure the ketone in their blood yes but it is because of the source of food that they are taking

[02:18:09] I see so they're basically getting medium chain triglycerides thread milk yes the immune change I glycerides being the main source there for energy conversion as opposed to some of the other triglycerides so the original bulletproof coffee is actually mother's breast milk before it is desperately and fancy coffe is that everybody drink yes so I do believe that that's another alternative so in essence you could potentially have pharmacological interventions that address mitochondrial respiration but they will not have to be classic pharmacology like never transmitted base for my golly they will be more of a metabolic pharmacology you can have near-infrared light by providing this photonic stimulation however that one is targeted is not systemic like you pointed out so one will have to find target luckily the forehead is more accessible we don't have hairs and we can target their prefrontal cortex that shows the initial cognitive difficulties as people become older and that's what we have been doing and then the third one we through the diet which you facilitate because as you pointed out the insulin resistance because our glucose levels are going up because we cannot transport it into the tissue especially nervous tissue which was a primary consumer has effectively and then we have these high levels of glucose for longer times so there's more insulin there is being released and then these desensitizes their receptors so there is a natural developing of metabolic syndrome as we grow all because of this phenomenon these manifests itself then has less so straight for energy for the brain and then you have account decline accelerated associated with obesity and hypertension and this insulin resistance or is all part of the same age-related picture and probably people eat more because they are trying to make up for this lack of energy that the brain is consuming and if any organ is more liable to influence our eating behavior it will be the neural tissue that's such an interesting thought because I've always believed as you've suggested that

[02:20:28] I think our appetite is driven by fundamentally important physiologic processes and starvation would be the most important among them and servation in the modern world doesn't look like starvation in the prehistoric world starvation in the modern world can be in the presence of obesity because we're not talking about the obvious we're talking about the cellular level and so if cellular metabolism is deficient which is often the case in insulin resistance an individual can be functionally starving and that can drive it now I've always thought about it through the lens of the liver but you're making an argument that says there's also a central starvation and it could be also driving these yes additive changes yes but there are also peripheral components like you say for example the case of the obese an individual that has obesity will buy almost definition who have downregulated the ketogenesis the ketogenesis enzyme will not be upregulated unless you're consuming your own fat and these are trainable enzymes like individuals as well so if you don't go through periods of fasting you cannot elevate this enzyme so somebody who is obese and suddenly stops eating is starved because this body cannot it doesn't presence of hyperinsulinemia it is a very painful transition into fasting you can use your body fat to to feed especially the brain which is the first one that is gonna give you these signs and symptoms so the first thing that somebody has to do is start out by having a periodic periods of fasting that in in my own case I do it once a week usually between Friday and Saturday I fans for at least fourteen or sixteen hours you know it's not difficult to do if you have an early meal in a late brunch you will have significant fasting and you can accelerate that process by consuming some of the circulating glucose if you do a workout the morning so by doing that I am allowing my body to build up these ketogenic enzymes and therefore then during a regular day in the week if

[02:22:49] I don't need anything between meals I don't feel hungry because I can consume my own body fat and people who are obese cannot do that they don't have the biochemical machinery to do it so I believe that's probably the third way of approaching this problem if those three things could be used and like I say it may not be possible to combine some of them like I will have two empirical determine how much methylene blue one can have systemically so that do not produce photodynamic effect when I do transcranial laser stimulation we hope in the future we may be able to do this with LEDs right now with the LEDs are commercially available we haven't been able to find the results that we get but we we are investing time in trying to change this so it would be safer and cheaper to do so right now the only ones so my bio engineering colleagues being able to collaborate with me and develop a device that we can transcranial II do imaging with near-infrared spectroscopy and actually measure the concentrations of oxidized cytochrome oxidase in vivo in the human brain and we published that last year and this allows us to directly have a measurement that we are indeed engaging our target and this also will allow us to find what is the optimal dose response for that particular brain because like you indicated different people have different heads and the transmission would not be equivalent so this is what we're doing and so we have obtained three major grants for doing this with the bow engineering group in the Dallas area for example professor Hanley Lu we are doing the developing of these devices to monitor the physiological changes and this is

[02:24:50] Grand by NIH that is called the brain initiative program and then here with my colleague andrianna Holly we have a grant from the Natural History Room aging to test this transcranial near-infrared light in older people and people with mild cognitive impairment and then the third has been a benefactor who's giving us large amounts of money so that we can pursue this line work with the transcranial lasers and I can show you the endorsement from some of the people in they feel oh yeah I'll take a picture of this and we'll put this on in fact it was actually Jack who directed me to speak with you maybe six months ago this is exciting you know I want to add one other thought to this which is I hope that if somebody's listening to this who's involved in traumatic brain injury that someone ought to look into a clinical trial of using methylene blue as a rescue agent during periods of traumatic injury because again mechanistically it's at least plausible that you could salvage and rescue some of the transient insult and the damage that goes through that and again there's another example of a disease for which we don't seem to have any solution other than the obvious which is avoidance of the injury the insult but there's still a lot of people out there that are being exposed to repetitive head trauma and you know as you probably know there's been some interesting hypotheses around the presence of ketones in the system before traumatic injury and potentially as

[02:26:27] Salvage after but it but it seems to me that this methylene blue story probably deserves a bit more attention in other areas given these properties you've described I actually agree with you and I would say because he's using emergency rooms I believe in a really ambulance you sure have methylene blue available and if there is any insult that compromises metabolic supply to the brain you're gonna be better off infusing methylene blue with a low concentration we're talking about one milligram per kilogram concentration that is gonna be neuroprotective regardless of the sources it could be transients chemica tract it could be any stroke we have done this in a stroke models in animals using the methylene blue and we being able to rescue the majority of the of the damage producing the import in animal models and animal models where we look at this longitudinally using fMRI so we know this working animal I just been able to convince emergency physicians to start doing this - there is chemic patients and not only for the brain but ischemia affecting all the other organs he is being also driving animals of neuro trauma with similar benefits so the problem is there is no interest by the pharmaceutical company because they cannot make money on it and unfortunately the NIH is also influenced by if you're using all drug essentially we're repositioning this old rock for these other applications and never protective engine or more generally metabolic protective agent they are concerned that their investment is not going to pan out because when it goes to commercialization you know we're gonna be able to patent that medication and believe it or not even though it works if there is no prospect that profits can be made they don't want to invest yeah that's a shame because I worry there will be in the state of limbo where we're not really gonna know the answer and we can't know the answer without clinical trials this is about as easy an agent as there is to study given its long history it's relatively well understood toxicity profile and in many cases the speed with which you could see a response especially if you're studying ischemic events and I will tell you that just a couple of years ago was published last year the group that I collaborated with in

[02:28:59] San Antonio we were the first to show the effects of methylene blue in the human brain using fMRI and measuring blood flow measuring bold signals and also in those subjects we did memory testing and we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in their memory retrieval just after an acute treatment with methylene blue in a blind placebo control study the first time that that was done contrary to these all the groups that are doing it has an ND tau agent in healthy and older people we can improve memory and we can demonstrate using imaging that we can do this through methylene blue so the only problem is there's not gonna be any profit because I believe its own company will like to develop this purity form a surgical grade methylene blue there will be a huge market all the companies may imitate them but there is enough for everybody still the cosmetic aspect of having urine that is this color is a problem many people will not affect it yeah well
