## Description

In this episode, psychiatrist Paul Conti, M.D. discusses the impact of the fear and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stress, anxiety, and trauma it may impart on the population. Paul examines how this situation has highlighted the challenges we face at the societal level as well as the individual level, and stresses the importance of seeking absolute truth above personal truth and taking action as individuals as a means to combat many of these pervasive problems.

We discuss:
-Paul’s personal experience with a presumptive case of COVID-19 [2:15];
-Through the lens of trauma, Paul’s overall take on the lasting effects of this pandemic on society [4:30];
-The imperative to unite as a species given the isolating and suspicious nature of an invisible enemy [8:15];
-The indigent population and the affluent population—The commonalities and differences in how both populations have been affected [16:15];
-The prevailing feeling of demoralization spanning the population [25:30];
-Health care workers—What lingering psychological effects might they suffer from this? [35:00];
-Could this pandemic be a catalyst for changing the way people think about science, truth, and logic? [46:30];
-How our inability to deal with uncertainty exacerbates the problem, and the need for humility [58:00];
-What has been Paul’s recipe for self care during this time? [1:06:45];
-The forthcoming challenge of reintegrating back into the world when the quarantines lift [1:14:45];
-An urgent need for change which must come through individuals seeking absolute truth and taking action [1:19:15]; and
-More.

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features a deep discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Paul Conti about the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. They explore how the pandemic has highlighted existing societal problems, trauma responses, and the challenges of dealing with uncertainty. The conversation covers both individual and collective psychological responses to the crisis, while examining broader implications for society's relationship with truth, science, and emotional reasoning.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Discussion of COVID-19 symptoms from personal experience [04:08]

- Explanation of trauma responses in healthcare workers [15:57]
- Discussion of how isolation impacts mental health differently than other stressors [08:52]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on meaningful connections with family and loved ones [1:09:59]
- Practice acceptance of uncertainty [1:00:53]
- Maintain humility about what we don't know [1:03:38]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Acknowledge trauma rather than suppressing it [1:11:22]
- Find ways to create meaning during isolation [1:13:13]

**4. Notable Quotes**:
"Spring has come but inside of me" - regarding family connection during quarantine [1:11:22]

"I don't know is actually a beautiful answer" - on embracing uncertainty [1:09:59]

**5. Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can societies better prepare psychologically for future pandemics?
2. What specific mechanisms could be implemented to create the "alliance of common sense" Dr. Conti describes?
3. How can healthcare systems be restructured to better support mental health during crises?

The episode is particularly notable for its examination of how society processes truth and uncertainty during crisis situations, and the long-term psychological implications of pandemic responses. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this analysis?

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome back to another co vid 19 episode of the dr podcast my guest this week is dr. paul Conti some of you may recognize that name as Paul was a previous guest on the show about a year and a half ago when we spoke about mental health depression trauma a number of other things on this episode we kind of pick up a little bit of that thread but obviously talk much more specifically through the lens of the anxiety trauma uncertainty that many people are experiencing in the midst of the pandemic the quarantine itself the isolation the uncertainty that comes from it both economically socially politically etc Paul and I go off on a number of tangents here that I think you know on some level speak to societal problems on other levels speak to challenges that we all have at the individual level so I hope you'll enjoy this is a bit of a deviation from the normal flow of information as it pertains to some of the more technical aspects of this which will obviously continue to return to but I found this to be a very helpful discussion and frankly the type of discussion that Paul and I will often find ourselves having in the midst of situations like this but hopefully by being able to have this discussion and share it with you some of you may find value in this so without further delay please enjoy my discussion today with dr. Paul [Music] hey Paul thank you so much for making time to talk this afternoon I know you're even busier than you normally are but I know you appreciate that some good can probably come of us to setting some time aside to talk thank you very much and I so appreciate you having me back on it's such an important time and there's so much to think about and talk about and thank you for taking the time to have me on so Paul before we jump into some of the stuff I really wanted to talk about it it's probably worth you sharing with people your own experience with what has to be believed as a presumptive diagnosis of kovat 19 you got sicker than hell about a month ago as did one of your children and then as you've described those symptoms to me they are very classic for the diagnosis you're happy and you're no stranger to get in the flu and things like that but tell folks a little bit about what you experienced my wife and my two-year-old both just had malaise mild symptoms but my six-year-old who is were kind of like carbon copies of one another she had pretty significant symptoms by pediatric standards so I kind of knew it was coming and I had the malaise and just generally not feeling good and that was there for a couple of days and then I very rapidly got very very sick in a way that felt different than flus or food poisonings or other illnesses felt extremely hot alternating with really terrible chills that kind of took over along with it and awful headache and it's just deep nausea not like I've experienced before and interestingly I wasn't congested was strange to start to have a feeling of shortness of breath really having to catch my breath and start taking deep breaths and to be that sick but to not have any congestion it was scary I mean

[00:04:08] I remember at one point I was in the shower and I had the water turned up high enough to scald me like it should have been really painful and and I was just shivering and I had goose bumps and just things that I haven't happened before and I could really see the lethality did some one who has some of the medical comorbidities I'm fortunate not to have whereas older and you know it was scary it was scary well I think it also kind of gives you an interesting perspective to be able to talk about the stuff I want to talk about with you today as you know I've been spending the past month trying to figure out how to be useful and that's required more starts and stops and fits and starts than normal because there is this feeling of helplessness you and I were talking about this earlier which is like there you have this desire to do something but at the same time you feel like you can't really do anything and there are days when I just wake up and all I want to do is watch Netflix and play in my simulator and and literally have nothing to just forget that this is all happening but then there's days and I wake up and I feel really motivated and

[00:05:11] I think how can I help and I and I haven't figured the answer to that I suspect doing these podcasts is helpful the feedback has been great and I also think that people are probably at least as interested if not more interested in the kind of stuff we're going to talk about today as they are on the nuances of this type of RNA virus versus that type of virus versus this drug in that druggin and while those things matter I get a very vague sense there's a coming fatigue around the uncertainty of whether the case is gonna peak and what all these things and there's a little bit more of a sense of okay well what does this mean for me as a person and how have you been sort of struggling with the role that you play as an individual to your family and then the role that you're trying to play with your patients and then maybe even thinking more broadly as I know that you know and you and I have talked about on your podcast I see the world through the lens of trauma and I think part of what just frustrates me at times to just utter exasperation is I think the predictability of so much that has gone on around us and I think we've had an explosion of so much technology so much increase in capability and I think we've made errors as a society in how we're utilizing that technology and we've really paved the way

[00:06:37] I think for deeply traumatizing ourselves as a society as a country and also as a species and and I think I've said I'm a psychiatrist and one of the principles that's that's at times used in psychotherapy is this idea that everything is as it should be which does not mean morally right it means that the vast majority of things that a loss I mean some of them befall us but so often there's a predictability that we've gone 19 steps down a 20 step path and then are surprised when we get to the 20th step and I think that we have been paving the way for terrible trauma to happen both medically and also socioeconomically and what so disturbs me is that as the virus itself recedes in whatever way that ends up happening we're gonna have to make decisions and I think that those decisions have tremendous gravity to them I mean I try not to be inclined to hyperbole but I think that they are as serious as you and I have discussed in other venues I mean is it America passing the torch is really no longer being the world leader that we have been since the Second World

[00:08:01] War are we setting the planet on a reckless course that we can't recover from and and I think we have to learn from this and I think we're I wring my hands and gnash my teeth is the idea that maybe we won't learn from this and I'm worried that we may then we could then sort of traumatize ourselves out of existence what do we know about how humans internalize this type of stress versus other types of stress that are more potentially uniting so I know that this sort of there's a body of literature that would say look pandemics do different things to the human psyche than most other things like war terrorist attack even natural disaster because by their very nature they are isolating Sebastian

[00:08:52] Junger has written very eloquently in his book tribe about how post 9/11 suicide rates actually went down people United there was a common enemy and then there was something we can all do to stand together but the literature on pandemics actually doesn't suggest that to be the case what is your take on these sort of differences in the psychology and psyche of us when confronted with these different external stresses I think called the one hand it creates tremendous feelings of loss of control and tremendous vulnerability and it also creates suspicion we know that viruses are real but there's still that part of human beings that we can't see it we can't just stop it no matter what we're doing it can be lurking around invisibly and those are things really that terrify us the idea of an invisible enemy and we internalize this in a way that is more and more isolating and I think historically just makes people very suspicious of one another I don't know like the idea that hey if I meet you on the street I don't know if you're gonna accidentally kill me and I can't read I can't use what I would do to read safety to read control in order to keep myself safe and I think in addition to that we have a very big added problem which is that that feeling of vulnerability that feeling of loss of control is looking for an enemy

[00:10:18] I mean after 9/11 whether we ultimately were targeting the right enemy or not as there was there was an attack there was an enemy and Here I am very very worried that the social structure we have allowed to arise is a social structure that searches for an enemy and I see the xenophobia the racism that then makes us feel that there's an enemy that actually isn't our enemy instead of seeing look this is a human ailment and people who are suffering are suffering in the same way I mean as you and I know as physicians when you see someone who's really suffering nothing else matters who we're not thinking about like what's the color of that person's skin and how much education or money do they have like it makes us all the same but we lose that perception of people who are suffering in China suffering in Iran suffering in America suffering in Europe suffering in Africa and South America we lose that and we start to I fear further the processes that are separating us already to such a dangerous degree Paul if you could wind back the clock to January 12th so the virus has been now identified the DES scientists in China have sequenced it if you could if you had mind control over world leaders at that moment in time and you could have programmed everyone in such a way that there would have been complete cooperation and borders would have effectively dissolved not from the standpoint of interstate travel and things like that in terms of nationalism everyone said hey you know what we're all in this together this thing's going to be a potential disaster let's completely share every piece of information we have and we're all part of the same country so whether you're our enemy in Iran from a political standpoint or not no no we're all going to share resources of testing of data of medication etc is there any precedent for the world being cooperative and productive in a manner like that because I got to be honest with you the only thing that comes to my mind is these goofy sci-fi movies where the aliens come to invade and all of a sudden the Russians and the Americans are friends because they have to sort of fight the alien like so outside of goofy sci-fi is there any reason to believe we even possess the ability for that degree of cooperation I don't think we do right now I think we can but I don't think we do and this is because it is much much easier to ally around a common enemy how long has the expression oh my enemy's enemy is my friend I mean that's probably been around since people develop language in some form or another it's very easy to identify that is my enemy so now you are my friend hence the alien invasion even he looked during the

[00:13:16] Second World War nations that had a lot of adversity there were examples of unification around fighting the common enemy did the promise what is becomes much much much harder and requires different elements of the human beings ability to call upon the deeper parts of our brain the parts that don't just react with what I think of as traumatic aggression in order to ally around something that really isn't an enemy the virus isn't plotting against us this is enough intelligence it's invisible in order to unite we have to recognize our shared humanity and our ability to for people to cross borders our ability to destroy one another with weapons has so far exceeded our ability to do that I mean if you look at the reactions in various countries it's been the same reaction I mean I think to meet core principles here are the everything is as it should be if we make decisions 1 through 19 we're going to end up a decision point 20 and the other point is how much the middle school playground plays into all of this even it was a 3-4 weeks ago around maybe three weeks ago my my father who's in his 80s his girlfriend who's in her 80s we're gonna go out to an event with like 500 people my response is oh my god stay home and then he responds why would I stay home there are no cases of the virus in New

[00:14:45] Jersey where my father lives right sure if you don't test people then you don't know that there are cases and I think this is so part of the problem that we've reacted in this hey nah I don't have the cooties it's not mine it's a middle school playground reaction and when you combine that with how easy it is to just blame somebody it's someone else's fault and that we've I think socialized ourselves through how media in general let alone the sub component of media that social media has grown up around us to self indulge to that appeal it's not me it's somebody else's fault somebody's might me can't land here and then it's a combination of misguided aggression and sticking our heads in the sand and then look where this leads us

[00:15:36] I mean the scenario that you cited shouldn't have to be science fiction we should be able to collaborate in ways that recognize common threats to us but we don't do that we so quickly devolve into the first part of what we were talking about which is I feel insecure I feel vulnerable are you my enemy and I certainly don't want you to think that there's something wrong with me maybe you'll think I'm your enemy and then we all put our heads in the sand and look what happens down the road it's so clear how preventable this was and also how inevitable it was given that we did not set the groundwork in place to prevent something like this so you've been very busy obviously in the last month you're as busy as I am if not more busy generally but my guess is that the people you help have found themselves relying on you perhaps even more than normal is that a fair assumption in some ways I mean it's been interesting that has been the case for some people for other people there is some sense of safety in sort of hunkering down at home and that idea of circling the wagons so it's interesting how much it has really dichotomized in that way and also what I'm not seeing nearly as much of are the people who were so at risk socioeconomically before this now a lot of what I do bifurcates you know I'm I'm the medical director at a place and it provides drug and alcohol treatment for mostly an engine population that's part of the work I do and the other part tends to be with people of more resources what I'm not seeing is the gigantic and I mean gigantic swath of most of the country that were on a socio-economic precipice before so then not only do they have the medical risk the fears that I do think are pervasive and are perhaps temporarily sooth by holding up at home but they're not soothed by holding up at home if you don't know what you're coming out to we've known for a long time that the specific numbers vary by study but but the idea that like half the population in this country couldn't survive and move forward from $500 unexpected cost or a $500 shortfall so on the one hand we've talked but look how great the economy is doing because employment rates are high but so many people are living either in desperation or one step away from desperation and I think what we are doing is yes a lot of people are traumatized absolutely but that gigantic swath of the population that is most of us are traumatized disproportionately because they don't know what they're emerging too because we've set up a system that has essentially made that inevitable I mean how long was it going to be if half or more of the population can't survive through a $500 need or $500 shortfall something is going to trigger that and it's not a surprise that something triggers it on math and I think that's where this is a gigantic medical problem it is a social problem it is an economic problem when you add those things together those things synergize and it becomes a societally threatening medical socio-economic problem and we haven't had that before so let's take both extremes of the types of patients that you're most working with most commonly working with in the first group you said is the indigent population who you're helping with substance abuse presumably many other medical and psychiatric problems that accompany those how is that population doing in the presence of what's happened in the past four to six weeks and it's added desperation on top of desperation which is obviously not a good thing it's a element of the population that I mean I think in large part we've left behind because I see the world through the lens of trauma

[00:20:03] I see part of my reason for existing in fighting the shame that's created by trauma but there are ways in which shame is called for and I think as a society there are things that we really should feel ashamed of the ways we don't give people chances to get back on their feet and then we have a populace that's there's so much desperation in that part of the population that yes this makes things worse but it's not a change in how a lot of people in that situation are living day to day life and I think that's lamentable which is a sad statement yeah it's a terrible thing to say but that's even in the 20 years or so that I've been doing this right which is it's not a gigantic amount of time it's not a small amount of time but the change has been dramatic where there is a part of the population that we just leave behind they need more resources than we're willing to put towards them so we check a few boxes and we say we're doing things that we're not really doing as a society and we've written people off on mass now that is not true of everyone and there are people who of course work so hard and so selflessly to help other people but as a society we've sort of decided that it's okay if you can't navigate complex systems or if a couple of bad things happen either things happen to you you make bad choices that as a society I don't think it's subtle that we've written people off that way and then what about the patient population you take care of for whom the economic stress of this is not nearly as it is for perhaps the majority of people but who still have their own demons their own neuroses their own stresses what are you seeing that is unique to this environment that is maybe either similar to or even distinct from other things that you have been in the capacity of being a therapist for example during the

[00:22:06] Kannamma can't Astra fee of 2008-2009 again post-911 you know any other sort of external stress or how does this stack up and what is it that you see that's maybe unique about it I think I've never seen something that just supercharges this idea that if I fear enough then I'll be safe which I believe is an impact of the insecurities that many many people if not most certainly most people I encounter I believe feel sort feel about the world this idea that our biological drive to recognize threats so that we can stay alive and pass on our genes has in so many people mutated to where we're essentially living in a state of constant hyper-vigilant discomfort there's always something else to do it's never enough for us to be safe and secure and I think the society is always telling us that the news has mutated from providing news to grasping people's attention grabbing people's attention in a way that says look at that news again because you're gonna see something else bad oh the anecdotes of he got up at 9:00 and felt healthy and by noon was in the intensive care unit right it's like we know this we don't need to be assailed every moment by every threat to us and we have become prisoners of the insecurities that we have generated and I think that comes through these biological drives that have led us to a place that is no longer keeping us safe and and if you think of the biological drives and psychological drives to to increase our safety by participating in social systems and economic systems and a lot of that has mutated into strivings that make no individual sense within systems that make no group sense so people that are working and working and putting money away for retirement but the vehicles that they're in aren't safe vehicles anymore we've created so much insecurity that it affects people even who say have enough economic means but still have this pervasive feeling that there's always always always something to fear and then this idea that if I fear enough

[00:24:36] I'll be safe then starts to spiral out of control and people get obsessive and people get ruminative the same the negative thoughts go over and over and over what if something happened to my kids and and like okay what if we all get sicker well what if we don't get sick but there's a terrorist attack or what if what if what if what if and become so pervasive that what's fascinating to me is that I don't see peace in any demographic does it matter if people have tremendous amounts of money or of no money I just don't see peace anywhere and I think I am trying to scientifically ascertain for it right I mean I'm trying to listen to people talk to people learn what's going on inside of them and sort of what is uniting us is this pervasive insecurity and then these parts of our brain that want to keep us safe go into overdrive and inadvertently make us feel so much more vulnerable what do you think is actually happening from a neurobiology standpoint

[00:25:37] I mean we're now over a month into our quarantine here and spoken about this on the podcast before I pretty fortunate there are people who are quarantined inside tiny apartments and they don't have the luxury of being able to go outside in their yard and things like that so I want to be clear that I'm not for a second lamenting the quarantine

[00:25:56] I'm in because I feel really really lucky but I can't for the life of me understand the degree of irritability that I've experienced over the past month and I've done a little bit of a better job in the past few weeks at least not lashing out but there's no denying internally a feeling that I have that is well frankly I don't know how to explain it or I'll tell you because I mean it's so frequent I can tell you how

[00:26:21] I felt this morning so this morning I was I was exercising so I'm lucky to have a gym at home so I can exercise and again intellectually it's not lost on me what a privilege like I think of all the people who can't go to the gym now and their best thing they can do is push-ups and sit-ups in their apartment so intellectually I get that right but I'm sitting there thinking I don't really feel like doing this and frankly if this quarantine ended tomorrow I don't feel like going anywhere there's this weird feeling of I don't know what I want but I don't want this I have a lack of interest in anything but of course I'm as busy as

[00:27:01] I've ever been so there's this very difficult feeling of every minute I'm moving I'm hustling I mean even my exercise is scheduled in between calls and this thing the other thing but if you told me hey I could wave a magic wand and make the coronavirus go away tomorrow and everything would be back to normal I didn't even have a sense of joy over that I was just like what would I do I don't know how to describe this

[00:27:26] Paul it's a I'm sure there's a word for this sort of overall just lack of interest in life maybe that's too broad a way to explain it but it's this really weird oscillating feeling of sort of sadness and irritability and almost wishing I could just escape something but not ensure what I want to escape does any of that make sense absolutely and then I am finding there are more people who are escaping through say drugs and alcohol and other really unhealthy things through that sense of desperation and I think what you are describing is demoralization and you tell me if this resonates with you and I haven't talked about this before so you tell me if this resonates that that I think somewhere in there is a sense of futility that says if you look on two different levels run on a personal level you've worked very very hard to better yourself or better your situation in the world take care of your family and there's something that speaks to okay there's a roof over our heads and we're sheltered here but have I succeeded in doing that or have those efforts been futile because I can't protect the people around me I can't make things okay that my personal efforts to make life okay I've come to not me no I've seen not saying these things are true but this is what goes on inside of us because you feel that okay you can shelter everybody for now but what does it say about the world around us and what does it say about the next threat that maybe you won't be able to shelter from that's one aspect of how we become demoralized the idea that hey no matter what you do and how hard you work you can't make a difference you're gonna be vulnerable anyway and I think it brings that home to a lot of us because

[00:29:11] I think I'm not saying that we should be demoralized but I'm saying I believe there's truth to that because I think the world around us the world around us leads to the everything as it should be says the world is such that we're not safe on the other hand there are things that you've done on a broader level that are about trying to contribute to the world in a bigger way around you I think which you said is incredibly spot-on and of course that's part of what makes you who you are is your ability to sort of see things I would never see I've never thought of this as being demoralized but

[00:29:47] I think you're absolutely right and I think you're right that I'm not alone I suspect people in 2008-2009 were demoralized for a different reason which is if you're that person who did everything right and found themselves on the wrong side of a mortgage because the value of their home came crashing down and they were not sophisticated enough to know that hey these types of loans have these hard nasty resets on interest rates etc etc you could very easily say hey I did everything right and look what happened right and now I think you're seeing that same thing all over again but with far less economic stratification the economic stratification plays probably a broader role in your resilience to this but it probably doesn't play as much of a role in what you just described which is whether you're the wealthiest person in the world or the least wealthy person in the world they're still sort of you that you should live in a world where you have some ability to control your health if you do the right thing if you take care of yourself if you eat sleep correctly exercise correctly like you shouldn't be afraid for your life and I'm not saying that that fear is rational by the way because as we've discussed the majority of healthy people who get this virus are going to be totally fine but there is a degree of fear that says that that might not be true I think that's right and that's where I'm sort of fond of saying it's the soup that we're all swimming in and I think that's the commonality wealth status social standing like those things don't matter when we're swimming around in the same soup and neither you nor I we're not political animals and and we don't have political discussions in that way and this isn't about politics I mean

[00:31:44] I'm a believer that many things in the world are driven by strong individual people good bad or otherwise but I do believe that that's not always the case there are cases when social forces evolve and then they produce something that's going to be a certain way regardless of the specifics about so this isn't republican democrat like it's so far from that but the idea that the importance of expertise actually has become less and less and less and less important because everybody can have an opinion and can just yell that opinion louder and then what we get is an erosion of expertise where doesn't so much matter any what does somebody know or not know because well everybody's got an opinion and I think we've seen that evolve and my thesis is that the inevitable outcome where the basics that we think of about the state around us the government right keeping us safe like just isn't true and we do expect that we live in this society we participate in we vote we pay taxes like

[00:32:52] I expected if I'm driving down the highway there's not going to be like 20 foot long hole that's 20 foot deep that my car falls in if expect that's not going to happen but that's not the only expectations we have we expect that there's something going on that's providing us with some sense of protection that there's some force to the world around us that everything isn't just based upon opinions and opinions have been justify whatever the person expressing them wants to justify and I think what we're seeing here is like truly that the emperor has no clothes and again I'm not speaking this is not me trying to be political about the president I mean like the emperor of the society we live in it's not adorned with the splendor that we think will protect us there's a truth here that there can be hurricanes that devastate individual places and people don't come to help

[00:33:51] I mean look some people go to help but not in a way that says look let's make sure that this doesn't devolve into complete lawlessness like we haven't been able to pull that off in focal settings how are we gonna pull that off on a national setting where there has to be acumen and resolve to decide what tests should we deploy to have the willpower to deploy I mean it's not that long ago where people were still saying oh some person somewhere in this place had the coronavirus oh my gosh oh my guys and we look at that person had it we now know there's been half a million people who have it there's a seduction of like let's look at that person and look at that bad thing and then we can posit that were other than that and the truth is that that never made any sense that never made any sense that example you gave where everybody's cooperating we would identify who's been exposed know who those people are test those people protect their contacts we could have done so much better containment but instead that there really hasn't been that much going on to protect us and I think this lays that bear in a way that the hurricane showed us in a focal way but it's not just about health I think it's about socio-economic risk Paul I shift gears for a minute and talk a little bit about health care workers I don't know how much time you've spent thinking about that in this setting but do you have any thoughts about sort of the lingering effects of this on that population which has a couple of things working against it one they're on the front line so while people like you and I have the luxury of working remotely with people we care about during a time like this they don't the doctors and nurses that take care of these patients don't get to do so remotely so now they're at this increased physical risk and there's you know still some evidence to suggest that the risk that they face is even greater just based on potentially the viral loads they're encountering and things like that so this is real risk secondly you have the sort of the morale insult that comes with seeing their own colleagues also become patients so when they start to have to care for each other do you have any thoughts about sort of the PTSD that comes to this population in the months that follow this or potentially even longer I think is going to be so pervasive I think the trauma is going to be pervasive and even generational I think that family members children of people in that situation will be affected by it and potentially deeply affected by it going forward I think we are facing be what I think of as the appalling consequences of compounded ignorance I mean look at what we have done in our health system like you and I have both been in it in a whole bunch of different ways and I think people in it can see how little it makes sense that we're trying to run our health care system in a way that is pushing people to the limits and extracting profit and reducing costs wherever possible and then ultimately everything is running in a way that stretches people to the limit stretches people to the limit and how much have we seen of that in any one doctor's nurse as social workers the respiratory therapists I mean everybody is pushed to the limit in systems that have in a sense abdicated their intelligence they're not being run with intelligence are being run by rules that no one is looking at whether they make sense or whether they keep people safe or whether they make the people who are doing the work in that system feels so disempowered and so devalued how many times have we heard I mean you must are we getting here this the way I do of health care workers just talk about the feeling of their own expendability they're working in a system that doesn't know them care about them value them and again I'm not trying to criticize individual people there's so many people trying to do their best but we've allowed the system's evolved into this compounded ignorant where we can't take care of the people who are supposed to take care of us and they know that and they've known that for a long time and they're seeing it come to the forefront so what's a path forward either in the scenario where this just lingers on longer than any of us would like to imagine or where it becomes sort of a vacillating ABing flowing pandemic or even under the scenario where look six months from now everything is back to normal this virus is squarely in the rearview mirror we have effective treatments and the healthcare system is back on its feet in either situation how would you think about managing the long-term toxicity of this because especially if it's sort of smoldering but not resolved I mean that from a psychological trauma perspective I think the first thing we have to do which is by no means a given is acknowledge the trauma when a person has been through trauma there is a strong and reflexive impulse to keep that inside we don't understand it we feel ashamed of it it's so threatening and we push it down and we need it to be validated I think we need to validate as a society that we set ourselves up for this that we said the healthcare systems up to be overwhelmed to not have the protection mechanism that the testing that they needed and now we need to essentially acknowledge and atone and I don't mean in some way that's atonement in some abstract way but we actually need to make things different I mean I think you would agree and again you're the master of what data tells us right I think we can look at data and see how we can and should be doing things better there's not a tremendous mystery to that I mean there are places that are doing it better there are paradigms that we could utilize more that don't reduce people to cogs in a system and I think we need to number one acknowledge that to the people who have felt like just things in the system and you can throw away a mask just like you throw away gown just like you can throw away a person we have to get out of the interchangeability of employment in the modern world in healthcare as well and we have to look at what are we doing with our resources and we have to make it different so people feel like you understand me and what has happened to me and you are trying to make it better the you being all of us as a society if we don't do that just like with any other trauma if no one acknowledges it and there's nothing being done to try and make it better then it will stay with that person and fester and it will lead to all sorts of bad outcomes that will see years down the road we'll look in retrospect and we'll see rises in rates of alcoholism will see rises in rates of domestic violence will see rises in rates of suicide will see rises in rates of people just giving up and walking away from important things to them like we'll see all of this we will see all of this because if we demoralize the population and we don't rectify that it's not going to be okay and if somehow it seems to be in six months that will be a deceit that it will be tempting to just believe that and go on but we have to have who the courage of our convictions to know that like that's not okay let's look at is it true that everything is as it should be meaning we let ourselves here if it's not let's argue about that and prove that it's not if it is let's look at it and change it and I think it involves people standing up and saying look this needs to change there needs to be not how do we make the systems better how do we find to this or that or give this to this population that really suffered no no is how do we acknowledge the need for change and that's the hardest thing to do is not that we're going to make systems better we're gonna look at systems then we're gonna bring change to them what does that look like

[00:42:33] I mean I I understand what you're saying in the abstract I don't think I understand what it means I don't think I know what that looks like five years from now when this is long forgotten how does a society from a mental health perspective look if they are going to be resilient to the next pandemic so if there's a SARS Cove III that's coming in 2030 what there's a national psyche what does the mental health of a population need to look like the year before that hits to do a better job than we might be doing today and to do maybe the best job that can be done given the circumstances what has to be true of that population I think what we need is what I would call an alliance of common sense and I was talking about this earlier this morning with our friend and colleague Jim Koch alka about the ideas of how would one how would we work towards an alliance of common sense where people would say I can't pretend that something is okay just because it suits my interests even if I know it is false I have to first prioritize looking at truth and can we the people who would do this which ideally could be a growing movement led by people with influence and with the ability to say we have to put aside whatever our wishes might be whatever our animosities might be that we actually do have to treat this post-911 or like the Second World War and say what we need to look at now is truth what are the failings in our public health system as a planet and also as a nation they stretch people to the limit they stretch resources to the limit when do we pretend that lies or truth and how can we say that that's okay

[00:44:33] Republican Democrat or other who cares and again this gets contentious because as soon as you get political and you can't talk about change without shredding into the political then there's such bitter and brutal animosity that it tells all of us mean part of me I want to have this conversation because

[00:44:52] I care about the world even if I didn't have children I would care about the world I hope but the fact that I have children is I want to have this conversation but there's a part of me that says I put your head down and go back home because ultimately whatever you say is gonna make some people really really angry and people get angry and bitter and vindictive what we need is something that fights against that that says we are going to ally around truth in our medical system in our social systems in our economic systems we have to look at this and if people start a lying in that way then we have all the expertise that we need medically social systems public health economically whether it's economic on a local or on an international commerce system we absolutely have every single bit of expertise we need what we do not have is an alliance of common sense of people who say I will stand by that come hell or high water I will not give in to lies

[00:46:01] I will stand by that then we can start making the world better if half the population can't survive a five hundred dollar shortfall I am NOT going to pretend that the economy is okay or that our social systems are ok or if the healthcare choices that people are facing are too complicated for them to understand and then people ultimately don't get the care that they need they show up at emergency rooms for their primary care demoralizing the emergency room staff that want to take care of people who have emergencies like there's so many thousands and thousands of examples and we just need people to say it's enough do you think that this event is potentially a catalyst for changing the way people think about science and truth and again I use those two in the same sentence because when you take a step back and think about what the truth means I think we have to differentiate between personal truths and absolute truths I think it's true that Formula one is amazing but I also recognize that that's a personal truth it's shared by you but it's not necessarily shared by everybody else and that's okay you and I believe if that doesn't make it true

[00:47:09] I believe I attend Senna is the greatest Formula One driver of all time again I think that verges on being an absolute truth but I'll leave it in the category of a personal truth yes but when you start to get into things that are absolute truths that's really where science comes in science is a toolkit that allows us to test hypotheses it's a methodology that allows us to examine absolute truths and do you think there's a chance that what we're seeing here could ever be a catalyst for allowing that distinction to be made in broader society because I it's not clear to me that it does I think that for for the majority of society there's a blurred line between absolute truth and personal truth or relative truth Peter I think you're striking to the heart of the matter because absolute truth operates through logic systems in our brain I mean ultimately this does relate to brain biology absolute truth resonates with logical systems in our brain relative truth personal truth resonates with emotional and what's got effective real in big systems in our brain when we engage effectively in the world around us and again I have a thesis that says we as a society are not engaging effectively because we have lost the distinction between those two that lets us make the personal truth secondary to the absolute truth so the idea is there's a strong resonance if I feel something to be true

[00:48:56] I mean there are social issues I feel very strongly about that resonates with me emotionally boy because I'm a human being and says because I believe that that makes it true that's my belief so that's how I want it to be so that's true but then there the other systems in my brain say there are absolutes that I want to hold up and against that and I want to have those absolutes govern my own personal feelings so I may feel just as rapidly that for me the one is the greatest sport ever I want everybody to believe that and if I let my emotion run away with me where do I end up I end up thinking everybody who doesn't believe that is an idiot as opposed to saying look I feel that way but hey look at all these other sports and they're people who really love those other sports and they see the excitement and the personal strivings that I see in Formula one so the reflex in us is to elevate the personal truth the emotional to supremacy and we need to overcome that so that logic wins the day because logic is not charged the way that emotion is and I think media social media I mean if this is the heart of the matter have made it very easy to elevate personal truths you believe a I believe

[00:50:12] B instead of having a conversation about it isn't it just easier and in some ways doesn't it feel better for us to say the other ones an idiot and that's that we're indulging that in a way that then starts making logic subservient that makes the absolute truth subservient to the mo to the personal truths and if you look at how change happens the concept of a dialectic where you have something and you have something different from it where you have two different things and they become something that's different from both of them I think is where we're at this is going to be a catalyst to something and there's something on the other side of it I strongly believe is going to look differently than what it looks like now if it's not after this and things seem to be back to normal this will just be one of steps that lead us to things being different and one way things could be different is that absolute truths really do go out the window we very much come back to superstitions and we're really kind of not that far away from it now and we could very very easily get there or this will be a catalyst for us writing ourselves and saying look we must prioritize logic whether I like what it says or not and there I think how do we make the catalyst the resolution of that dialectical one way and not the other is we need people to make this I'm just calling it's no magic to the words but an alliance of common sense that says hey if you think a or you feel a and I feel B that's always if you feel a and I feel B that instead of immediately being at each other's throats let's stop and look at the facts let's stop and look at logic otherwise I mean how far again I'm not trying to be overly dramatic but look when the Khmer

[00:52:06] Rouge took control in Cambodia right one thing they did away with was doctors right this is very easy to boy you put one person's blood into another we can teach people to do that okay what about blood types you have any doctors or science or hospitals and then they just started randomly transfusing people and either making hemorrhages or putting one type of blood into another I mean that was an utter human catastrophe there but they're whiffs of that going on now who cares what the science says about hydroxi clerk would try it I mean this is emblematic of us leading ourselves away from logic I don't see how we're not towards the structure like that everything is as it should be tells me that we can't let that happen because that ends it destruction there's nowhere else it ends so we need this alliance of common sense of people who will stand up and say if I disagree with you because I feel differently I'm gonna look at the logic and if the logic tells me that what you're saying is right what I'm saying is wrong then damn it I'm gonna

[00:53:03] I'm gonna go forward with your way of seeing it no matter how I feel we need more of that I mean do you worry Paul that we have spent such a scant period of our evolutionary history with any formal language around logic and science I mean for all intents and purposes it's about 1/10 of 1% of our evolutionary history has operated with even the nomenclature of science the skillset and the tools for logical thought the reason that I think religions exist and the reason that mythology exists and superstitions exist is they became ways to explain things prior to a nomenclature that could describe things the Sun went up on this side and the Sun went down on that side and before you understand that the earth is spinning around the Sun you have to concoct another explanation and so we're not hardwired to think critically our limbic system has literally billions of years of repetition and maybe not our limbic system exclusively but say from amygdala up right in other words the most primitive part of our brains have billions of reps in them and as you point out the brainstem the amygdala the limbic system are generally driving us now when in reality this would be the time to have higher cortical functioning take over but that is such a recent recent development not just evolutionarily where maybe for the past 50 thousand years we've had those structures of our brain and I could be off by some magnitude there but directionally but really only about 500 years in terms of formal structure of scientific methodology is this just not even a fair fight

[00:54:53] I mean we're sitting here having this philosophical discussion about logic but I mean in times like this when we recede to our lowest common denominator how in the world can we expect those systems of logic and science to prevail so on the one hand you're speaking to a very powerful truth which is we are driven to be driven by the limbic system by emotion it has always held the upper hand so it's not a fair fight but it's a fight we can win you know what I mean the odds may be stacked against us but we can win that fight as evidenced by the fact that we have evolved in a way that the scientific method was it became understood and then we learned oh wait a second the earth does revolve around the

[00:55:38] Sun we can fight that just because the odds are against is this because we're swimming against a strong current doesn't mean that we can't with the right preparation and cooperation successfully swim against that current what has happened and I think my amateur read of the sociological data is that that what has happened is our ability to unleash emotion has way outpaced our ability to to sort of for our logical processes to keep up with that the explosion of social media of people being able to communicate with one another so rapidly about what they feel our control mechanisms haven't kept up with that I mean the fact that the lead physician in charge of fighting this virus has to have bodyguards right right

[00:56:29] I mean whether he does or whether it's been talking about I get I don't know it's part of this anger that that person said something I don't like so stone him right I mean these emotional responses are in US and what we need to do is like be adults and not be children we're being children and we need to be adults and we need to say look we need to hone our control mechanisms but what we're not doing is saying we can't have systems around us that propagate just how someone feels about something and then Stokes the emotion of everyone else who feels the same way I don't like this that person is bad like this political opinion I like whatever it is I don't like that spreads like wildfire I think in a way I don't know if it's happenstance or not but I think the wildfires that are plaguing us in California and Australia right it's these are far-flung events that I think near the wildfires of emotion that go on and it doesn't matter what's true people's emotion runs wild and what we need to do is to step up to the plate and develop greater control mechanisms and look at how do we stop misinformation how do we establish sources that are arbiters of truth outside of politics that are arms what's actually true and we don't have that we need more of the things that aren't sexy and aren't glamorous otherwise this emotion you're talking about is running wildly ahead of us and it's going to metaphorically make wildfire that consumes us and I don't think that's catastrophizing do you think part of it is we're also not very well-equipped genetically to understand uncertainty so in what we're talking about of sort of absolute truth versus personal truth there's another layer of complexity so if the personal truth is that Formula one is the most exciting thing on the face of the earth I think most people if they're being intellectually honest can come to an understanding that that's a personal truth no matter how strongly one feels about it but let's use the example you've brought up the example of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for this to say that hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for kovat 19 doesn't really fit in either of those categories it depends on how its expressed it could be expressed as hey it's my opinion that looking at the scant data to date the risk of this is lower than a certain threshold which deems it an effective treatment in someone whose risk is high enough that level of nuance to something kind of straddles both personal and absolute truth another example is climate change part of the struggle with climate changes nobody can really talk about it in terms of probabilities and with error bars and so you basically get polarized arguments that both sort of have their own flaws so on the one hand you have people that just completely deny it or if they don't deny climate change they're sort of adamant that man can play no role in it and on the other end of the spectrum you have these extreme hyperbolic estimates that might represent a scenario but not necessarily the most likely scenario or not necessarily a complete picture of the plausible scenarios in other words again it comes down to uncertainty than probabilities and I think that something like this this experience that we're dealing with makes it very complicated for our little plebeian brains our little reptile brains to deal with and

[01:00:21] I'm struggling with it and I'm someone who understands probability and I understand logic and I understand science but I have to be honest with you I am tired of saying I don't know and yet it is the only answer I have to give a hundred times a day I get asked a question and it can be my daughter saying dad when do we get to go out and have dinner and it can be one of my patients and he was asking me let me ask you your opinion Peter what do you think is going to be happening in six months then again all I can say is I don't know

[01:00:53] I can give you five different scenarios of maybe this maybe this maybe this maybe this but there is no absolute truth that I can offer that person so I could give a personal truth which is this is my opinion but science rarely proves anything it's not like mathematics right in mathematics we have proofs but in science we just have high degrees of certainty and again I just I worry that this introduces a new layer of complexity to a discussion that already makes it impossible to sort of cope with a lot of signal of a reasonable amount of signal an extraordinary amount of noise and then a supercharged emotional swamp that dilutes and amplifies the wrong things if that makes sense I'm rambling a little bit I think my point is I'm generally pessimistic Paul I guess is my point yes Peter of course I don't know right for sure but I see it maybe in a more simplistic way I don't think there's another level on top of it because I think that I don't know is actually a beautiful answer if you don't know what do we really know raise it we know so little that admitting that we don't know engenders humility it engenders a humility that makes us careful I don't know if a pandemic is coming let's look looks I have some preparedness to it I don't know if this is helpful or not let's learn more about it there's a caution that then leads to Alliance I mean we started early on talking about how can people countries nature to ally it's through a sense of humility that you know what I don't know and I'm not ashamed of not knowing I mean think about in medical school I think part of the myths of medical education right is that you never say you don't know I think that's the worst thing ever I think why would you ever say you know when you don't know and we're talking about somebody's health there's a humility in I don't know that leads to collaboration that pushes against aggression it pushes against that middle school playground of oh I don't know and now I'm ashamed and it leads towards progress the other side of that coin is what I see is the hubris that leads people to just declare that they know and there's a recklessness to that right I mean I think we're a society of angry frustrated people and we're getting angrier unique we're not gonna come out of this with more of that

[01:03:38] I mean people already were feeling insecure traumatized by the systems that we live in the insecurity model where my health care is coming from more people's fear of that $500 it's gonna sink them we're not going to come out of this angrier and the anger is what fuels at the emotion and then it's the emotion that then falls into the political spectrum so if that's the case then whether you agree with something or not it becomes a mechanism of your allegiance we start to look more like systems that say it doesn't matter what's right or wrong do you agree with me because if not you're bad and we're doing that all the time why is the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine a politically charged question that's insurmountable then we need to make it not a politically charged question there are political issues taxation rates social equality value systems were deploying there are lots and lots of political questions but because we are so angry and I think so traumatized and desperate as a population we make everything a political question and then that adds to that emotion side of things

[01:04:48] I think it is just the real truth versus personal truth logic versus emotion it is that but it's become so convoluted because the emotion is so high and it gets attached to things as vehicles for that emotion and that's what we have to work against that's where the alliance of common sense would say look we have to not be children we have to be adults and we have to look at what is it that I don't know and if their 20 questions and

[01:05:15] I don't know the answer to any of them well at a minimum I hope that that engenders humility in me and ability to work together with other people and listen to their opinions even if I have a say if I have a strong personal opinion about 15 of those questions but actually there's no logic to know any of the 20 of them can I find it in myself to have the humility to admit that and to say that and to say that to you and know that you're okay with that you're not getting humiliated for then embarrassed me for it right that's what people are afraid of did you have to know because you have to fight with what you're gonna say you know we need to stop that and we don't have to be I look I'm pessimistic too but that doesn't mean that I feel hopeless I am pessimistic but not nihilistic because I think the wake-up call what this can catalyze is people who are trying to do good things but may be hesitant to step into what seems like a political arena I don't mean to run for office right I'm just saying that truth personal truth versus real truth just has to stand aside from politics and our economic system our social system these are systems tied in politics and we have to look at the truth of those systems because they are not serving us well we have to separate ourselves our trauma and our anger and our shame and our frustration from what is logical truth or not and I think again I think you and

[01:06:39] I between us is what I was talking to Jim about this morning there are enough people who could step up to this plate but boy it's a thing people are least inclined to do because it's a thing that draws the most flak and the most personal animosity I want to shift back from the macro to the micro now you and

[01:06:58] I have spent a lot of time over the years talking about something that I think you're better at than I am but I think we both struggle with what has been your recipe in the past month for self-care I don't know how you do what you do I mean I think and and I don't just mean you I mean people like you right people whose job it is to take on sort of the burden of other people's pain and suffering and then to be able to do it in a manner that's not detached but rather to be fully involved and invested in whatever crisis whatever struggle whatever turmoil that person exists and how you then manage to buffer yourself from that without being detached take care of yourself so that you can continue to take care of people take care of your family again you and I have had endless discussions on the types of things that one can do here I just wonder if there's something that you can teach listeners about how you've done that and what can somebody take away from this when they're feeling going back to where we were a while I go back to that feeling of sort of low and morale just I forget how you describe it the way you do you very aptly describe how I was sort of feeling ymore Eliza yeah demoralize the thing is the words used yeah so let's assume that this quarantine is going to continue in the weeks and even months that follow and people are going to be in their routines that are full of stresses and stressors that they might normally be able to escape from and they don't have the luxury of picking up the phone and speaking with you or Jim or some of the other amazing people out there who are really just sort of a godsend to folks who have access to you is there something that they can do to ease the suffering and I mean the suffering in their mind which is of course the worst kind I think I think the answer to that is finding ones way to the lowest common denominator of what matters and I think if people are experiencing the truth now that they're say with their family the realization that that is what matters the most now and it's also what's going to matter that most tomorrow and I'd rather be with my family in a lean-to out in the middle of nowhere than any luxurious living situation alone and part of that realization that I think I can sustain them if everything else went away I could probably I don't know put some sticks together give us some shelter right like it gives me a feeling that what matters is care and concern between people being with the people we care about and look I'm hearing that from people too I'm hearing a lot about the silver lining of this which is more time with family

[01:09:59] I talked to almost nobody who say purchased anything in the last month other than necessities I don't care so much that I think matter matters does it matter and look I'm not advocating like I'm not a Luddite to raising let's go back to just living like we did a thousand years ago 100 years ago or whatever but it is meaningful to realize that the things I care about most are actually more immediately accessible to me in the moment and I think that's still going to be the case tomorrow hopefully everyone's staying safe and we're trying to ensure that that's what most matters and it's a good place to start from I think it engenders practicality it engenders humility it engenders a sense that everything is OK

[01:10:44] I've sat at home with my family for a period of time I wouldn't have before and I have a very strong sense that everything is ok sit around with my family cuz of a six-year-old in a two-year-old and we blew up six balloons and we're just throwing these balloons between the two of us I mean and we're happy right and I think we need more of that because it works against the trauma there's a realness and a connectedness to that that works against the trauma now look I think we need to change the social systems or we are not going to change the trauma and things are not going to be okay if I might ask your question you're not saying how do we fix this on an individual level of people in their homes

[01:11:22] I think the answers we don't but how do we feel better how do we let ourselves find some peace I think that is the answer my daughter who's turning six this coming weekend said to me she said daddy with you at home more it's like spring has come but inside of me and my thought was oh I'm not sure what else really matters and that doesn't mean I don't want to go to work and do my job but when I'm talking with people on the phone I'm looking more through that lens of what else really matters to that person that I'm talking to then the people that they love and I think we need more of that we need to fix our social systems but we need more of that and that's something that each of us can do at home right because it's really our interpretation of things are things out okay because I don't know what's gonna be like when it boots back up that's true too I don't have to live in that every moment and I can live in more time with my kids that's real and that's tangible and that's going to mean something to me this evening and tomorrow and that can be real for everybody and people who don't get to be with people that they love and that love them so thinking of how do we make more that in our life the idea that we all need love and we need things that are generative that make where there was it before does not just have to apply to human relationships it can apply to nurturing a pet or nurturing a garden to making a poem where there wasn't before like like it's kind of strange but our needs are not that complicated but I'll be damned if they aren't hard to meet in the system that we've set up around us we need to change it we need to change the systems but part of how we change the systems is to change how we're looking at them as individual people what am i valuing so if I'm hearing what you're saying it sounds like you think that this sort of attachment to others or connection to others is sort of an antidote to this trauma put more broadly

[01:13:13] I think the attachment to things that are meaningful yeah yeah sorry not to yeah that meaning to other people in relationships that mattered to our kids to our friends to our spouses right right okay City but not for all the money success prestige world mastery I mean if you could have all of it I mean you wouldn't sacrifice the ability to be with one of your children like that stuff matters the most to us and it's also where we generate our own meaning that's where I don't feel demoralized that's where I don't feel demoralized because I know that I'm have meaning to people and people have meaning to me and then I can find within myself the strength to put one foot in front of the other keep doing what needs to be done even though I sure do feel demoralized often I mean the reason why I think I can project and guess how you were feeling is because what you and I know each other very very well and I'm feeling the same way that you are it has whatever I contributed to the world made a difference or whatever I've done for myself and my family made a difference I mean the answers to those questions are yes but we feel that they're know when were confronted with the state of the world around us and again it just brings me back to this something more is called from us I mean there's a little bit of again I'm not trying to be political but when John F

[01:14:34] Kennedy said like ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country and yes he was speaking about difficult things he wasn't just say do more of what you're good at doing or what's easier for you to do or even think you're hard for you to do but you may need to do some things that are very very difficult do you see people having a difficulty reintegrating back into the world when the corentin´s lift do you see lingering fears I mean fears literally of infection recurrence of pandemic other forms of phobias that might not even seem logical or rational

[01:15:10] I mean do we have any insight into what people do after quarantines and what their psyches are left with this idea that if I am more afraid I will be safer is is going to precedence we're gonna see more anxiety more obsessiveness more panic more agoraphobic right fear of being outside of the home we're gonna see more and more of that and we're going to see more of the unhealthy coping mechanisms to that more drugs and alcohol we're going to see more of the unintended result of that like depression and accidents we're going to see more of all of those things because there's nothing to prove to you that you're not safe like a period of time in which you were very clearly not safe and

[01:15:57] I think if we reintegrate into the previous lies then underneath that is the knowledge that this is not okay it wasn't okay before so if we're now back to it it's not okay now either which is why we need to make change that ultimately yes this is about trauma and how this pandemic is traumatizing us and how we paved the way for the trauma of it to be so bad and we need to change that just like we need to change what traumatizes people individually if someone has been traumatized individually someone has been attacked and hurt and that person knows that there are people around them that care about that they care about them they care about what happened to them and that are working for change in the systems that allowed the trauma to happen in the first place then we help move that person towards healing and yes we need to do that for individual people in their trauma treatment and we need to do that as a society otherwise we will be no more successful as a society then will be the individual sufferer from trauma who is trying to deal with that trauma by pretending everything is OK which is a natural response because we're afraid of it and we're ashamed of it and we don't know how to deal with it and there aren't the systems around us to say you can come and talk about that then you don't have to be ashamed of it and you know what I have that too maybe I have a different flavor from you but I have what you have and like you and I know this I mean part of the reasons I think we've survived our own traumas is because we have not gone through them alone and we've had them validated and we ourselves have been validated and then we look to ways to make the world better and that's part of our demoralization that like it kind of hasn't had as much of an effect as we might have wanted so let's start doing something new about it because it does not have to be this way say rape cultures on college campuses you know what doesn't have to be that way and we start making changes my goods not that we've made the changes we need to but we start looking at that looking at what it really is and looking at the lies that's at all it's all okay and people are consenting and everybody who's drinking is de facto giving consent we look at those lies and we start making change and we start making less trauma and we start better being able to help the people who have suffered trauma that is a very real and tangible example that we are going to need to do on an individual basis whether it's healthcare workers who are afraid to go back in the hospital or it's people who are afraid to try and go find the next job or it's our society as a whole we have to change those things there's nothing else that makes it better I think it's worth pointing out for listeners you and I have known each other for 25 years we're pretty much inseparable in fact this is probably the longest we haven't seen each other in person because the last time we were together in person was

[01:18:53] January so that's for us that's an eternity I think it's worth the listener knowing you and I have never once talked about politics accepted in the context of history in other words you and I together we are not the type of people that sit here and wax on about current political affairs we over a meal will sit here and discuss the Cuban

[01:19:13] Missile Crisis at nauseam and talk about Nixon and all these things we love to talk about the history of politics we're not political people and I think it's important that people who are listening to this don't take this to be a political rant everything we talked about today seems to come down to a common theme which is those of us who sit here in the peanut gallery who are not in a position of leadership are gonna have to sort of become the movement of change in other words it's not enough to just sit around and pontificate about this stuff we are gonna at some point have to do something about it we're going to have to take some sort of action it's not going to be enough to just think about this lament this talk about this with our friends that won't change this system everything you've talked about from this most recent example which i think is a great one of sort of date rape culture on college campuses to social support network I mean all of these things in the end come down to not just being open about what we think is right and not right but it's also taking some sort of action it is going to come down to that and I don't know I do know it's funny I didn't come into this discussion with any sense of what we were really going to talk about I just knew it's gonna be something sort of interesting and not sort of the how does this drug work versus that drug work but I don't know that I really thought about it as broadly as you've been thinking about it it sounds to me like this experience you've made good use of your time you're forced exile from the busy travel schedule then you've thought even more broadly and deeply about some of these problems that we've thought about and talked about in the past together but but I don't think I think you've coalesced a broader mission urgency around this I think so Peter because

[01:20:58] I've just felt it these are not foreign concepts to me and these are things I have been afraid of but really seeing it play out it becomes so compelling and you talk about we're all gonna have to do things you those of us in the peanut gallery we're gonna have to do and it's not just that is we're gonna have to do things that are unpalatable and that's what I've really come to realize it's like a couple weeks ago garbage disposal never gets kind of clogged and and like there's a whole bunch of strategies I have to try and fix that I mean I pour a bunch of water down and I've got a butter knife and I'm trying to do things with it right and like I'm doing things but ultimately what I had to do to make it better was the thing that was on powder had to sit by hand down there into a bunch of gross stuff and unclog something and now everything is okay like I have a willingness to do things and you do too and lots and lots of people do right but what we shy away from is doing the thing that's unpalatable and the way Society has developed I don't think we can get around the political flavor of this right because if you want to set up like if I had my way there would be

[01:22:05] Committees of people with expertise but would look into these different areas but what they have to do is really unpalatable things stand against the status quo enter into areas arenas that are politically charged enter into minefields knowing is something unpleasant is gonna happen right I'm gonna try not to get myself killed doing it but something unpleasant is going to come of it and I think those are the things we shy away from and either the privilege of knowing and interacting with lots and lots of people who are helping and god bless that people are helping but there's a difficult message for all of us here that says yes help in the ways that you're built to help uncomfortable helping but you got to help in I'm sick of my hand in the garbage disposal way too which is why when child calls and talks about this and he starts talking about leadership in ways that come through humility that come through marshalling people to do unpleasant or unpalatable things to really look at this it resonates with me in part because like you and I I mean he and I have an ongoing dialogue about life but because I just I can't not believe that's what's necessary I try and do thought experiments where I come at a position that's diametrically opposed to mine it's different from mine

[01:23:21] I feel differently I have a different personal truth and I can't but come to this conclude which obviously doesn't mean that it's right but I'm using all the due diligence I can inside of myself and I can't but come to any other conclusion well Paul on that note I want to thank you for this discussion today I look forward to continuing our discussions over the coming weeks I rely on them heavily thank you so much as always
