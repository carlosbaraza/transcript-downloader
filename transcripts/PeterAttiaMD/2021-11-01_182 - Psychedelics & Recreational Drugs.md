David Nutt is a psychiatrist, neuroscientist, and the Director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit in the Division of Brain Sciences at the Imperial College London. His research focuses on illicit drugs—their harm, classification, and potential for therapeutic use in psychiatry. In this episode, David discusses his framework for assessing the potential harm caused by common recreational drugs and explains how they are regulated, which is oftentimes misaligned with actual risk. He describes in detail the neurobiology, mechanisms of action, and addiction potential of alcohol, opiates, cocaine, and methamphetamine and contrasts those with psychedelics, which have been given a similar regulatory classification despite their relatively low risk of harm and their numerous potential therapeutic uses. Additionally, David explains the promise of psychedelics like ketamine, MDMA, and psilocybin for treating drug addiction and depression and discusses how political pressures have created roadblocks to future necessary research.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. David Nutt discussing psychedelics and recreational drugs:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores the history, science, and therapeutic potential of various psychedelic compounds and recreational drugs. Dr. Nutt discusses the political and social factors that led to drug scheduling, particularly focusing on LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine. The conversation emphasizes how drug policy often contradicts scientific evidence, and highlights recent research on using psychedelics to treat depression and other mental health conditions.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Alcohol ranks as the most harmful drug overall due to both individual and societal impacts [00:15:30]
- LSD research included 40,000 patients and 1,000 published papers before being banned [00:45:20]
- Psilocybin shows comparable efficacy to lexapro (escitalopram) in treating depression with fewer side effects [01:25:00]
- Ketamine can provide rapid antidepressant effects but requires ongoing treatment [01:15:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Exercise caution with ketamine therapy frequency (twice weekly maximum recommended) [01:18:30]
- Consider therapeutic setting and supervision for psychedelic treatments [00:55:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Psilocybin dosing: 25mg pure psilocybin equivalent to 4-5g dried mushrooms [01:30:00]
- Ketamine dosing: 500mg typical for depression treatment [01:17:00]
- Escitalopram (Lexapro): 10-20mg standard dosing [01:25:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The ban on LSD is probably the worst censorship of research in the history of the world" [00:48:30]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal frequency and duration for psilocybin therapy in depression?
2. How can we better study microdosing given current regulatory constraints?
3. What role might psychedelics play in preventing rather than just treating depression?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of specific topics discussed in the episode?

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey david thank you so much for making time uh in your evening my afternoon here today very very much looking forward to speaking with you about a topic that i think is on a lot of people's minds lately well thanks for the invite i'm looking forward to it too let's start a little bit with your your background you it's it sounds like based on what i've read uh going back to your early teen years you you've always had an interest in the brain whether it be through the lens of neuroscience or psychiatry what do you think sparked that interest well thinking about things yeah yeah i guess it was a understanding that um i don't know i think when i was probably four or five i suddenly kind of realized that actually thinking was what actually made things make sense and then i realized that thinking came out of the brain and i've always been fascinated by the brain and actually i went to university to cambridge to do brain science i wanted to be a physiologist you know like hodgkin and huxley to do physiology and then i kind of realized actually that some that that was you know and single cells are interesting but uh but you've got to put the two you know the 200 billion together and make sense of those and actually that's where then we did neurology and that got a little bit boring because it's mostly people kind of dying slowly from diseases like hemotropic lateral sclerosis so then i moved to psychiatry and then it became really wonderful because you see every aspect of the brain in psychiatry well it's so funny to say that because i'm not making this up but this this morning my uh six-year-old son uh was in my office and he we were sort of fumbling around and i i have a whole bunch of racing helmets in my office and so he's putting them on and that got him talking about why we're wearing helmets to protect the brain and blah blah blah and and then i said well you want to see what he said what does a brain look like so i pulled up you know on google i pulled up some images of brains but actual anatomic images and and again he's only six but he's looking at this and he's thinking like that's very unimpressive and he he sort of says it just looks like a slimy thing and i said yep that's true that's what it looks like and he says but is this where my thoughts come from and i yeah yeah i said yes that's where your thoughts originated he said well how and i got to tell you it was very difficult for me to explain how electrical impulses work and of course i'm not going to get into action potentials and neurotransmitters but what's funny is it then took me down a rabbit hole of spending 30 minutes on youtube trying to find good videos of this for kids and i if anybody can find one please send it but i couldn't find great videos because the the videos that i found were more anatomic like this is the part of your brain that controls movement this is where memories are stored but he was asking a deeper question which was how does this blob make me think uh which it sounds like you were asking that same question as a four or five year old exactly but what's amusing even more amusing is my new book which is coming out later this year is called brain and mind made simple it won't be simple enough for a six-year-old unless he's very precocious but i have written a book for the general public to try to explain that this peculiar phenomenon that how lots and lots of single nerves can actually turn into all the complexity of of the different forms of consciousness and the different experiences that humans have and at some point and i think what you know the point you raise is a really good one it'd be really nice to then to migrate that down for for children maybe you know as a series of sort of comics or graphics because i think you know i mean it is the most wonderful thing in the in the universe the human brain there's no argument about it so let's get communicating as soon as we can yeah and and i do think that like for me personally it's not a question i ever contemplated early so it made me very happy that he was asking this question at the age of six in a deep enough way and and look even if the book is not written for a six-year-old i'm sure it will help me do a better job explaining it to a six-year-old um so so coming back to your career so now you've migrated into psychiatry which of course on some levels is really about understanding pathology of the mind which is effectively what all parts of medicine are whether it be neurology or otherwise um what were some of the first things that stuck out to you about the the pathology of the mind through the lens of a psychiatrist well the first patient i saw who i was dropped into there was a doctor didn't turn up i'm a medical student someone said please go an interview go and clark this this new this new patient so i'm sitting there i'm talking to this person who's not making any sense whatsoever and kept talking about there being a smell of fish in the room and and rambling on about this matter and after about an hour of trying to get some sense i say well thank you i just i have to go i'll be back in a minute and i go out and i talk to the consultant and he says oh wow he's clearly psychotic and i think oh that makes a lot of sense that's why he doesn't make sense and that's why i didn't understand what was going on so and what was very interesting actually about that is that the relationship between temporal lobe disorders those parts of the brain which are intimately involved in in aspects of consciousness and also smell and there is this peculiar overlap between temporal lobe disorders where you can be psychotic but you also have these olfactory hallucinations and that's what he had so he was hallucinating rather than in his ears which most people with schizophrenia do he was he was hallucinating in in terms of smell so yeah i've never forgotten that because it was just such a kind of completely bizarre experience and it and it made me realize i got a lot to learn you know now for most people when they go into psychiatry um and i'm sure this was the case with you you spend a lot of time learning the neuropharmacology of the agents that are going to be used to help treat patients with psychiatric illness and for many people that's sort of where it stops but you've also generated or developed this other interest which is in the neuropharmacology of these regulated substances you know call them illegal or recreational drugs and otherwise where did that interest stem from wow well so uh yes i i am i am a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at imperial college london and neuropsychopharmacology is is really the use of drugs to study the brain and to study the effects of of treatments for brain disorders particularly in the case of psychiatry psychotropic drugs my phd was on the gaba system on drugs and manipulating the gaba system as an undergraduate i think you know the big influence i mean i was extraordinarily fortunate so i i'm at university in cambridge in the 19 early 1970s when people are discovering that the brain is a chemical organ up to that point it was thought the brain was an electrical organ it was yeah it was like a very complicated computer or you know like a you know some kind of complex telephone exchange but then the the concept of chemical transmission came along uh and now we know that there are at least 80 different chemicals neurotransmitters hormones neural hormones and seeing that transformation from electricity to chemistry uh made me realize you know the way you study the brain now is through drugs which affect the chemistry of the brain and then there are these therapeutic agents which are obviously very important antidepressants antipsychotics anti-convulsants but then it raises the next question you know but people use other drugs to change the brain and they use them recreationally for like drugs like cocaine or crystal meth or they use them to deaden pain or or to get insights like psychedelics and um after a while because i've done so much research on drugs i was asked by the british government to help them think through drug policy well actually that was that was not true they asked me to help them justify drug policy but when i started working for them i realized that drug policy wasn't in any way evidence-based and when i tried to bring evidence to bear on drug policy they sack me because because it's much more convenient to have a political decision making about drugs than it is to have an evidence-based one what year was that that you got involved in that well i started working on the principles of assessing drug harms really back in the 1990s and it actually came with the rise of ecstasy and and people supposedly were seemingly getting harmed from ecstasy and i i i was one of the one of the experts who was asked by the government to come up with a policy which would reduce the harms from ecstasy and it became very clear when we were researching those that the harms of ecstasy aren't from the drug at all they're actually from the uh what you do when you're on the drug they're either from the fact you dehydrate because you dance all night uh or you over you get hypothermic because you're in an environment where you can't cool down and so we said and actually we brought in what in legislation in britain which said any club which is serving drinks which is where most people were going to have their exits either going to clubs they must serve free water because what the clubs were doing we're actually forcing people to drink alcohol or pay for water in order to to to directly get hydrated after using ecstasy and that and in fact they were doing worse they were turning off the taps in the they were even turning off the toilet so people couldn't drink water so if we've made it law that people had to get access to water and we also recommended a good policy would be to have chill-out rooms and of course a lot of clubs do have chill out rooms and those just those two simple um environmental approaches effectively you know very very few deaths from ecstasy since then until we got to the modern day when a variety of international policies have now made ecstasy considerably more harmful than it used to be how much did this coincide with or follow in lockstep with drug policy in the united states which really seemed to um get a get a real boost in the arm in the early 80s um was the uk leading or following oh every country in the world follows you the united nations united nations is probably still is paid for by the us and it does what the us tells them our every single british drug law until 2016 was made at the behest of the americans so you know america basically you know you know they say america sneezes the world catches cold america defined drug policy it started in 1934 with the the attack on you know the liberalization of drinking and the attack on cannabis and it continued and i mean of course the big inflection was when nixon decided to that the war on drugs was actually a better vote-getter than the war in vietnam so he switched people's attention to drugs and and you know the world has been fighting a war on drugs largely funded but certainly politically driven by america since then so let's talk a little bit about the framework through which one can think about drugs i'm a framework junkie everything i think about whether it's you know how to order dinner comes down to sort of a framework um so so what you know some parameters that people might think of right you know how harmful is this and again you know i think the goal of frameworks is to have them be as unemotional as possible and to have them whenever possible to be objective um so so how harmful is something would be part of it how addictive is something what's the physiologic dependence um and then even within harm you could sort of talk about the harm to the individual and then the harm to society as that individual acts are there any other things you would include or those three things largely encompass what you think of as as a good way to think about molecules well that's yeah that's that is quite a succinct way so i started off with something somewhat similar to that uh but more recently we've developed what's called multi-criteria decision analysis and it turns out actually there are 16 different ways in which drugs can do harm there are nine harms to the user and there are seven harms to society and the societal harms range from international damage you know like the us spraying asian orange in you know in colombia to kill to kill cocoa plants through to economic damage through to health costs through to damage to families et cetera so the seven harms to society and nine harms to the user and each of those can you can scale drugs on each of those uh those 16 scales and parameters of harm and if you do all that and put it all together and then do a weighting because obviously not every single one of those scales is equally important if you do all that then um you can actually very very transparently and very reliably rate the harms of different drugs and we've used this procedure in britain we've used it in europe and most recently in australia and pretty much all the drugs always rank the same in all those you know there's three sort of groups of western um jurisdictions so based on that type of a framework what are the drugs that consistently come to the top of the list in terms of harm aggregate harm so the most harmful drug overall in all in europe in britain in australia is alcohol and alcohol is the most harmful drug because it has way more social impact more harms to others than any other drug and that of course is because it's much more widely used you know 80 percent of american adults and british adults drink alcohol pretty much every family in your country in my country knows someone that's been harmed by alcohol either through them themselves getting your difficulties having accidents getting addicted or they've been harmed by other ones someone who's drunk a drunk driver or or someone who's drunk and violent but if you look at the harm to the user alcohol is number one argyle's about number four the drugs which are really harm to the harmful to the user are opiates crack cocaine and also crystal meth so that's super interesting right because those drugs have very different scheduling right so so heroin would be a schedule 1 drug correct cocaine would be a schedule 2 drug i guess crystal meth would be schedule 1 or would it be schedule 2 in the u.s i'm not sure in the in in britain it's one but i think i'm not sure in the us to be honest and then of course alcohol is not even scheduled in that sense it's regulated only by the age at which you can legally consume it and also by taxation right so um what we didn't talk about was tobacco where does tobacco fit into this framework yeah tobacco yeah we always do tobacco because tobacco is this is interesting paradox when we first did this we tobacco came out at about number six or seventh and the tobacco anti-tobacco got really agitated they say it is the most harmful drug because it kills more people and we said yeah but that's right it kills more people but they often die in their 50s and 60s alcohol is killing people in their 20s and that's more important we think our evaluation was that that the harms of alcohol is considerably greater than the harms of tobacco and i think most people would agree that you know tobacco does in the end kill half of the people who smoke but it does it later in life and uh it doesn't tobacco also causes relatively little damage to other people unlike alcohol this is such an interesting question and i don't even know how one would think about it because um you could also take the flip side which is there's probably nobody who's benefited from tobacco i shouldn't say that there is a benefit to tobacco which is that probably it helps some people calm down it probably helps cope with nerves but there's no moderate use of tobacco like smoking only 10 cigarettes a day is protective or the harm doesn't really kick in until you're at a pack a day no that's not really true any amount of tobacco is going to to take some toll on your pulmonary system and your cardiovascular system alcohol conversely you could say well look a person who drinks responsibly who has you know three drinks a week bears no cost of the consumption of alcohol from a relative standpoint i mean we could debate that i would argue that there's no dose of alcohol that's healthy but there are probably doses that don't rise to the level of toxicity yet to your point it's much easier to cross the line to into acute toxicity which also gets to another challenge here tobacco has no acute toxicity it's 100 chronic toxicity alcohol has both acute toxicity and chronic toxicity and it's that acute toxicity that results in incredible loss of life both to the individual into society does the framework allow you to to measure these things yes it does yes we can give you absolute ratings and rankings on both of those variables acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity and of course you know the drugs which really do badly on both of the opiates which could kill you instantly when you take them but also crack heal you quite quickly over time as well but there is another angle and that's i think an important angle which our analysis doesn't um bring in because it's it's difficult and challenging and i'd love to and you know maybe at some point we can do this and that's the benefits the you pointed out quite clearly that generally tobacco doesn't bring many benefits nicotine is a funny drug though it's the only drug we know of that both calms people but also improves attention and and so there are you know people who smoke you know generally although they're addicted they do get a better benefit at least when the nicotine is in the brain but alcohol has a much broader kind of social i mean alcohol is one of the most social drugs i mean after ecstasy it probably is the most social drug and that's why people use it so that so there are unquestionably psychological or social benefits from alcohol and that goes back for cent when it goes back that goes back to people yeah that's right you know you've got you know jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at canine why because wine was what the jews used to celebrate weddings and it's been used ever since we all use it we still use it today to celebrate so so alcohol is a very powerful pro-social effect which i think is why it's so widely used and why it's been apart from that little aberration of american prohibition well it's actually been stable in our society for for many millennia and do you think that that's the fundamental reason why despite the [Music] sort of i mean hypocrisy of it if we're going to be blunt we would make something like cannabis illegal while having something like alcohol be legal is it does it basically come down to our social dependence on alcohol now that's a great question and i think and it's a very interesting i haven't thought about those two in that context before but i think that's a very interesting point you make because cannabis is not a particularly social drug so people when they get stoned they tend to be quieter they're not it's not the party drug cannabis is it and it might you might be right it might be that people are less positive towards cannabis because it isn't so socially enabling as um as alcohol that's a very interesting point i take a different view up till now until you've said that i've taken a different viewpoint which is that people have been very anti-cannabis because the alcohol industry and the drug enforcement agency have seen cannabis as the enemy and and the disinformation that's been produced you know the hatred of cannabis which started with harry anslinger trying to keep the dea functioning after alcohol prohibition was disbanded you know that 100 years almost like 90 years of disinformation has actually poisoned a lot of people's minds economy so cannabis has been vilified and our god's been celebrated i mean it's been celebrated throughout history in terms of art and culture and music and television you know one of the staggering things i i i because of lockdown i've been watching a lot of netflix and i've been seeing seeing these disclaimers at the top saying this program contains product placement by which they mean usually this program shows people drinking an awful lot of wine yeah we've come a long way it's interesting point you raised i guess i hadn't thought of it um that that that part of the dea's you know that the ea needs a reason to exist and therefore you need boogeymen right if you're if you're if your business is smashing boogeyman you need boogeymen don't we have enough boogeymen with other drugs like heroin or methamphetamine or cocaine like i guess i'm confused as to and i don't want this is not going to be a discussion about the legalization of cannabis because it seems to me like that train has left the station i'm just amazed that um that there was such a lack of of study because i'll tell you where it's frustrating for me as an outsider i have a lot of questions i my patients ask me questions such as if my 16 year old son is smoking pot is that going to have a negative consequence on his or her brain development and i wish i could answer that question but i can't really point to rigorous studies one way or the other and to me that's a failure of not having studied this drug the way we should have been studying it for the past hundred years because you want to talk about a drug that probably has lots of benefits but also potentially harms cannabis would be a case study in that and i find it very frustrating as someone who prides himself in caring about data and trying to not have an emotional discussion about something that i don't have answers to those questions and it it seems like a real missed opportunity well it's worse than that i mean the reason you haven't that the studies have not been done is because almost all the funding for that kind of research in america comes through the government through nida and uh essentially there's neither has not been funded to study the benefits of cannabis even when and this is the real missed opportunity even when california voted to make canada medical cannabis legal what an opportunity you're going to have we know 20 million people using it you could you could you could have within a couple of years worked out its utility and its harms but the federal law because cannabis was illegal under federal law and it's just they could not fund research so it was it's one of the many examples of the perverse negative consequences of this prohibition approach to drugs so let's talk about a few other drugs that we haven't mentioned we've talked about basically things that are not particularly harmful we've certainly talked about things that rise the level of harm where do the classic psychedelics lsd psilocybin fit in along with some of their more distant cousins you know ayahuasca dmt 5meodmt and of course we haven't we've talked around it but we haven't explicitly asked where does mdma fit on this list of harm in the aggregate sense according to this sophisticated model that's why i kind of started off talking about mdma because that was my first introduction to policy decisions and and when i started working for the government back in 1994 i'd assumed that what they told me about the harms of drugs was right and then i discovered that when i did and my team did the more detailed and sophisticated analysis they were completely wrong i've been lied to and uh the real paradox of doing this this really in-depth multi-criteria decision analysis is it turns out that the drugs that have been most vilified and and which we've been taught are the most dangerous turn out to be the least dangerous so so at one end of the the most harmful drug is the alcohol one of the least harmful drugs the magic mushrooms in lsd and mdma so there's it's almost as if the the whole law is completely on its head so let's now simplify and talk about only harm to the individual so purely physiologic risk to self if i heard you correctly earlier heroin and fentanyl and its cousins occupy the top spot correct so aggregate greatest risk of acute and chronic mortality yes correct and then second you're putting the cocaine derivatives and then third would be the amphetamine derivatives so if we just look harm to to the user yes i mean crack okay crystal meth's probably more harmful than crack because it lasts longer in the body and the brain so i would generally crystals probably a bit more harmful to the user so it would be opioids crystal crack um let's talk a little bit about mechanism of action i'm very familiar with how opiates kill but you know let's just briefly summarize it is it mostly the respiratory depression is that the fundamental issue in the short term yep yeah it ca they kill you in overdose you take just too much you know what you're taking someone spiked your heroin with fentanyl and you stop breathing in your diet yeah you want to talk about you mentioned earlier almost nobody in america doesn't know somebody whose life has been destroyed by alcohol we're getting pretty close to that with opioids i mean i i personally know three people is it four maybe four who have lost a child or relative to an opioid overdose think about that i don't know that many people david it is terrifying and i'm sorry to say guys but you you kind of got it wrong and then you got it wrong again and you're still getting it wrong and shall i just briefly go through that sure so the fentanyl crisis is is very much an american problem uh and um and it's not just because there's obviously a lot of you the more of you you know the more people there are the more likely it is that people will die you know just but it's a disproportionate number of deaths so now i think last year more people died of opiate overdose and died in the whole of the vietnam war yeah and last year we set here in the united states a record for the most overdose deaths ever so it wasn't just the year of the most deaths due to covet but the real record the story behind the story is the most overdoses and and the answers are complicated and it's a it was a it's a it's like a perfect storm of things going wrong so so the the first perfect storm was the the excessive rollout of strong morphine derivative painkillers which were heavily promoted by some pharmaceutical companies and you all know they've been sued et cetera so i think the doctors also some doctors were to blame i mean you know some were clearly overprescribing but but uh but there's also the problem that chronic pain is very common you know perhaps quarter of the country have chronic pain when doctors are faced with no treatments no physiotherapy no occupation with all they had was prescription pad then they tended to veer towards prescribing opiates which are not good for chronic pain and it's interesting also you see the states which have the highest prescription levels of opiates for chronic pain are the ones actually that don't have medical cannabis you know the medical cannabis is the best treatment for chronic pain better than any other drug but if you haven't got that then you can't have it so that was the first thing big increase in prescription you know partly driven you know driven inappropriately apparently had a out of just a concern to help chronic pain the second thing was then the rise the dispersion of that of the into into society into you know parents kids were taking it and taking their rocks to get baron's oxycodone and dying so you have the crisis you have the concern and then you have the reaction the reaction then was to stop prescribing but when you start prescribing to someone who is dependent on an opiate they don't unless you provide them with something else like medical cannabis they are in withdrawal and so they go and get an opiate and if you're not prescribing it they go and get it from the black market and and then you see this complete paradox you see this rise of heroin deaths rise of fentanyl deaths because that's what the black market provides and then you get into this really the most damaging cycle or part of this cycle is the rise of fentanyl because until there was a huge increase in black market demand from the the people on oxycodone fentanyl wasn't a big issue but for various international reasons the united nations limiting the access of heroin the amount of of poppies it could be grown in a in a so-called attempt to prevent heroin misuse 15 years ago particularly the mexican cartels realized if they couldn't make heroin because they couldn't get enough morphine then they would make something else and they and they discovered fentanyls and fentanyls are so much more potent and there's so much more value for money economic you know even the simplest fence in your fentanyl you know it's it's you know it's 50 times more potent than heroin and twice as cheap to make so you don't have to be an economist to realize it's better to do that and then you get to the super fence and it was like parafentanal which are a thousand times more potent they're so potent no one knows how to measure them and so you don't know how much you're giving so we've you know you see it's a cycle a series of mistakes which has actually just led to this this terrible tsunami of deaths and and the only way to deal with it really is to have lots of testing to allow people to take anything they've got and get it tested so they know what it is eliminate fentanyl and start to bring in much safer treatments for people in chronic pain like like medical cannabis um i want to talk a little bit about the opiates before we leave it and come talk about a drug called ibogaine a derivative of iboga um you know i have read quite a bit about it and a lot of it's anecdotal but it seems that there's something very interesting going on there where you have this alkaloid that while it comes with its own dangers and it's not clear how over or understated they are relative to cardiac toxicity it seems to have quite an efficacious punch when it comes to relieving people from the throes of opioid addiction do you have experience with it at least scientifically if not through experimental collaboration well we're in the process of trying to do a study i i would dearly love to understand the nearest science of ibogaine and we're but it's been difficult to do that study because of the cardiac risks so but we're in the process of working with a company that's developing a derivative of ibogaine called noribogaine which may be less cardiotoxic and we're working with them to do some brain imaging to see whether we can if it is is it a normal psychedelic or not because um we don't no one's ever studied it yet by only the evidence as you see from from it's used widely in some third world countries as a as a therapy for opioid withdrawals also a licensed medicine interestingly in new zealand but they've stopped using new zealand because of of one death now that you know that's that's probably a bit of an overreaction which strikes me as a little bit odd right when you consider um so so based on some of the literature i've read you know the risk of a fatal arrhythmia might be one in a thousand and that's depending on what you're talking about one in a thousand is an enormous risk um but if you're weighing it against a person remaining addicted to opioids what's the natural history of that i mean that might be 300 out of a thousand yes about that yeah so do you have a sense of what the true risk of ibogaine use is and if it you know how much of that risk could be mitigated if it were administered in a proper setting which would be a setting with cardiac monitoring for example versus you know someone's house well one thing's for sure we're going to administer a cardiac of course yeah exactly so and there are plenty of other drugs which do have cardiac effects you know usually they're used by cardiologists so the answer you're right i mean that's why i want to study it because i i if we could get more clarity on its mechanism that i think would at least then reassure people there was a science behind it because currently it's well you go to west africa or you go to vietnam and you get over again and your brain is shaken up and you come back cured and uh you know i think we could probably improve on that i think there's also your point you make doing in a hospital setting i think makes more sense because um not just for safety but uh but also because i'm not sure it should be given during withdrawal that's when it is being given and i think withdrawal just we have you know there are other treatments which we have given for opiate users which have also been toxic in withdrawal you know people you know withdrawal is a serious medical problem so you know you know they're ill they're physically and struggling so i think adding a burden to someone who's in withdrawal is not a sensible idea so my thinking is that if once if we can restore a sensible balance with ibogaine we could potentially use it but also i'm very interested in using other psychedelics because i think the fundamental principle is likely to be the same between ibogaine or psilocybin or dmt in addictions you're disrupting these these overlearns these persistent patterns of over attention and over increasing you know enhanced love for for drugs you can perhaps break down those habit circuits and then allow people to escape meaning that things like the default mode network yeah that's right so i mean our current thinking about how psychedelics might be used in psychiatry is is to is built from this you know remarkable finding that you know the psych what's the psychedelic state is a state which is where you have completely disrupted the default mode network this is the network in the brain which in which your your main sense of self the the core of you is in the default mode network and uh and embedded in that of course is whether you are you know your depressive thoughts or whether your love objects you know your heroin addict anything that's really related to you is embedded in the default and and how how how innate is that uh versus how uh how formed is that well the the default mode network i think exists in children and and babies and it it is what you are it is the part of the brain in which where you encode yourself your self-referential memories your plans you know your retrospect you know looking back looking forward putting everything it is where you are we know that if you know if you damage the frontal part of the default mode network your personality changes you damage the posterior part of the default mode network you kind of you become a very strange person who really struggles with coordination and integration so the default mode network is a fundamental part of orchestrating what you are um but in that of course are all the things that you have been so in the default note network coordinates your access to good memories to bad memories to to use of drugs to resisting the use of drugs etc but in a very simplistic way the sort of current sort of thinking is that some elements of the default mode become uh misaligned or or malignantly over engaged with negative thinking and depression or compulsive attitude to the seeking of drugs and drug use and if we can disrupt those with psychedelics then potentially people can kind of restore a normal balance in that network and then and have a more rational approach you know a less less constru less determined so so the brain is kind of determining things like addiction and even though people don't want to use the drugs they often find themselves doing it even though they don't want to because their brain is kind of driving them that way and we're going to come back and talk about the impact of psilocybin on the default mode network but but i guess to your point this might be one of the ways in which ibogaine or iboga kind of help rewire a brain for an individual who is opioid addicted which isn't of itself kind of an interesting thing isn't it in that there's got to be a genetic susceptibility to this because there are many people who take tons of opioids during you know say a post you know postoperative recovery from surgery and you know they take tons of the stuff and then when they have to stop it they stop it and that's the end of it and yet there are other people for whom that's not true so do we have a sense of what that what that genetic susceptibility looks like and is it more importantly is it possible to predict that a priori so that we would understand hey this is a person who is at such high risk for opioid dependency that even if they have to get their wisdom teeth pulled out we are not giving them this medication we're going to come up with a totally different pain management strategy yes theoretically it is unlikely to be in the genes well it's probably polygenic i'm sure yeah yeah exactly there's not going to be a gene um what what what do we know about why people become addicted well we know we know that social factors are hugely important you know i mean if you've seen the wire then you know that uh downtown baltimore i lived the wire well i mean i did my residency in baltimore so i i took care of the patients in the wire yeah it's a frightening place isn't it i mean it's unbelievable the book the corner which the wire was based on was the book i once i matched to do my residency in baltimore a friend of mine who was a year ahead of me in at medical school who had already now spent a year in baltimore i was like hey do you have any advice for what i can do to kind of get ready for because i'm moving from stanford to baltimore you can't go from the most posh place in the world to the least and he said um his only piece of advice was he said read the corner because it's literally what you're going to be living in and it will give you a great sense of empathy for the patients that you're going to be taking care of um and it's a riveting book which ultimately became a riveting series absolutely and you know i a couple of years ago i was on my way to philadelphia from washington to give a lecture and as we poured out of baltimore i was looking at the train window thinking this it's like a war zone is this hiroshima because in the downtown border i hadn't realized quite how destroyed it had been and if you're living there and you've got no job i mean and the only thing you can do is deal drugs you take drugs you deal drugs so a lot of drug use addiction comes because that's the one way people can actually achieve both the sense something that takes away the misery of their lives but also in a way if they become drug dealers become some a role so so coping with life stress is one reason people use drugs but there are some people you know they're very you know you know the rich successful people and um who who still use opiates and get and get into problems with opiates and um the example i i give two examples of this two two oscar winners tatum o'neill youngest ever oscar winner mary's the best greatest tennis player this baby ever been you know got two wonderful kids lives the life that everyone envies you know she's famous beautiful everything there but when she comes out of heroin treatment she says the only time i felt whole was on heroin and you see that i see that with patients not just heroin patients with alcoholics there are plenty of people for whom alcohol makes them what they want to be only when they're drunk that they're actually functioning normally and why that is we don't know and actually one of the interesting things you know they're like the reason i want to study psychedelics because i'm wondering whether whether that gap that can only be filled by drugs could actually be kind of refilled or at least remodeled with psychedelics yeah so um yeah so that's another and then of course there are there are people who who get you know who use drugs to get high and then they find somehow that the heart their brain becomes sensitized to the drug use so that they you know they lose control and that's more classic with people you use cocaine or crystals so let's talk about those two drugs just just from a mechanistic standpoint and where the risk actually comes from um take your choice which one you want to start with well let's start with the earlier let's start with uh let's start with cocaine because that's the that was the first well there were several cocaine epidemics but i mean let's talk about that and yeah i mean cocaine i give a lecture sometimes which is was was freud right to give up on psychopharmacology because of course freud was a great protagonist freud used cocaine himself he thought cocaine was a very powerful drug for getting people of heroin he got one of his his disciples off heroin by giving them cocaine he didn't realize that cocaine also caused dependence in fact freud and his um his protege both became cocaine dependent that's another hopkins that's another hopkins link by the way in baltimore was the the godfather yeah yeah so the basically the father of the surgical residency in the united states and the first chief of surgery at hopkins uh william stewart-halstead himself became addicted to cocaine when he became obsessed with it as a local anesthetic and so in the in the process of experimenting with cocaine as a local anesthetic which of course it became a very potent and remarkable local anesthetic he and many of his residents became cocaine addicted um so it's sort of you know it's a footnote to the to the story of the the creation of the great american surgical institute well uh it hasn't stopped they don't get addicted to cocaine and you want to get addicted to remy fentanyl usually the anaesthetist but that's another story let's get back to cocaine so i think the reason freud went it became into psychology was because he got then became completely terrified of pharmacology because he kind of assumed that any drug would have that problem so you know you can maybe give cocaine credit for the development of psychoanalysis but but when we get to the modern era you know then you know cocaine is the ultimate fun drug it gives you energy and drive and and um you know an enormous sort of sense of focus and and purpose yeah and then a terrible crash and and we now you know we know that it's that's due to the release of dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain uh but it's very spiky and uh and during the course of a binge over the weekend you know the brain gets perturbed and then people start to get paranoid and withdraw and some of them will get sensitized and become addicted and some of them will die because of course there's a cardiac effect and also there's this problem that if you mix cocaine and alcohol you get a drug called coca-ethylene which is a longer acting and more cardiotoxic version of cocaine you know i have patients who i mean our patients are always going to disclose to us what they use we ask this question point blank which recreational drugs do you use and um a number of them will say hey you know two or three times a year i use cocaine and and they want to know what i think and again the goal in that situation is not to come across as preachy and dogmatic but it's to sort of have a point of view and have it be grounded and my point of view with cocaine has always been i don't think it's worth the risk and i don't think it's the right kind of drug because you know just as much as we're now talking about a framework for drugs i have a much simpler framework for drugs which is um it's really only got two levers one is what is the physical risk of this drug to me as an individual so with cocaine what is the true risk of cardiac toxicity what is the risk of deepening physiologic dependence over time etc and then the second component to my framework is is this a drug that only alters your state or does it have the potential to alter a trait i'm borrowing that from the book called altered traits um which which gets into this distinction and and so the idea being is you know psilocybin for anybody who's ever taken it is clearly a drug that alters your state but if it just altered your state you probably wouldn't take it because it's really not that pleasurable but the real benefit of is is the potential to alter a trait whether it be depression smoking cessation or something else and so if a drug can only alter your state but it has no potential to really alter your traits i.e how you behave off the drug is it worth it and and so my the way i explain this to patients is i say i don't think cocaine can do that so therefore it it has two strikes it's o for two in the peter framework it's it has a physical risk that is non-trivial and it's not going to make your life better when you're not taking it and therefore i think cocaine makes no sense to take do you agree or disagree with that that's a very interesting analysis i like that i might start using it so do you agree that basically there isn't a positive to cocaine that i'm missing there isn't a benefit to it i i certainly would would say absolutely that's absolutely true for crack for cocaine i'm not entirely sure i mean i think there are people who can use it just once or twice a year without getting into much difficulty provided they don't have serious cardiac problems so i certainly wouldn't be using it at my age but then look at like there's the famous example which basically accelerated the war on drugs was the case of len bias in 1985. uh are you familiar with the story of len bias oh he was the probably the most famous high school pardon me college basketball recruit so he played basketball at the university of maryland a complete superstar uh basically on the level of a michael jordan um and he was drafted by the bolton the the boston celtics and probably had he gone on to play for the boston celtics would have altered the course of the nba for the next 10 years the day following the nba draft he was back in baltimore celebrating with friends they're at a party in their dorm room he's you know they're using cocaine he has a sudden cardiac arrest and dies and this really really shocked the nation uh this was a really big deal um and and and certainly some would argue that that was that only reinforced and doubled down on sort of the the nancy reagan-esque just say no mantra which of course reinforced the war on drugs um so so again when you can have this totally you know the healthiest 21 year old in the country can die and you don't know what you know the details right how much was he on was it laced with something you know one doesn't know no but you've got to remember that you know sudden death in athletes we just had the european football championships and one of the star players ericsson from denmark had a cardiac arrest on the pitch so super fit athletes might be more susceptible yeah yeah particularly if they've got us you know if they're big and they've got to develop some kind of cardio movement so so yeah athletes aren't paradoxically more potentially you know at least as vulnerable as other other people to these these effects so so talk about methamphetamine crystal meth these these drugs which obviously the uh the amazing netflix series breaking bad uh brought everyone awareness of what these drugs are but but physiologically neurochemically what is it that they're doing and what is the danger well they're very similar to cocaine i i i remember as a junior doctor my very first period is a junior doctor giving methyl amphetamine intravenously to a man who had serious status asthmaticus geez amphetamines were developed as a treatment for asthma they were developed as an alternative to ephedra ephedra is a natural plant product it was discovered to have this bronco dilating properties back in the 1800s there was a huge demand the plant couldn't supply the demand so german pharmaceutical companies went away and made a synthetic ephedra which they called amphetamine and it was used largely for the treatment of asthma really to the second world war when people realize it could actually be used to keep soldiers awake and and and it's another interesting aside i've i'm very interested in the the history of drugs and war because they tell us quite a lot about the the consequences of drug use and well i often give i often give a talk when i talk about amphetamines i compare the the allies so the brits and americans we use amphetamines sulfate whereas the germans and the japanese thought they were really clever because they had this super amphetamine called methamphetamine which lasts a lot longer but what they didn't realize was that longer is not better and and the turning point of the war was actually the the north africa campaign when the germans were pushed back when they got to egypt um so roman reigns last year that's right absolutely by the desert rats the the the allied troops the australians and the way the desert rats used to work was that they would be up all night hang you know working around the germans hurrying them blowing them up and then they go back they that they'd be up all night on amphetamine sulfate and then they go back and they sleep all day but the germans would take methamphetamine to stay up to fight to defend themselves against the desert rats but they couldn't sleep in the daytime and eventually they became sleep deprived and paranoid and the same with japanese you know there's these descriptions of how the japanese became complete had this terrible hallucin sensory somatic hallucinations from using large doses of crystal meth for long periods so crystal meth is it's longer acting and probably more neurotoxic than amphetamine sulfate talk about the neurotoxicity what what actually happens to the person's brain because we you certainly have this meme of the crystal meth user right no teeth bruised pin skinny emaciated but that meme doesn't actually tell me about their brain what's what's actually happening to them well they're certainly pushing their dopamine system to a point where it's probably depleted and that seems to then lock them into a state where they can't really function normally in the world without taking the drug there's also a bit less good evidence that it might also damage the dopamine pathways to the frontal cortex which impairs their ability to to make judgments to executive function etc but i have to caution it i mean the the the big concern about crystal meth actually came as a result of the japan after the second world war there were you know factories crystal meth factories in japan you know there were barrels of the stuff and there were a lot of japanese soldiers had nothing else to do and they used to use huge doses of crystal meth often intravenously and and the evidence for brain damage really comes from that population there's not so much evidence from it being when it's being used as it tends to be used now um orally without you know in more prolonged periods so i'm not sure that you get a lot of what you might call cortical damage with crystal meth but i think it definitely does distort the dopamine pathways in your brain and and will affect your motivation and your ability to to sort of get up and get activated etc so now let's talk a little bit about these drugs that unfortunately or you know for they seem to have the same scheduling and therefore they're viewed by the dea as both as dangerous in terms of harm or risk of of of addiction and as medically useless because really that's the criteria for schedule one right is high potential for addiction and no medical use and so um cocaine does not fit in schedule one because while it is highly addictive we at least have one appropriate medical use for it which is and it's an it's a great anesthetic especially in the nose um obviously fentanyl is not schedule one because even though we acknowledge it's highly addictive it has this pain blunting effect remarkably psilocybin is schedule one mdma is schedule one so lsd is schedule one so let's talk about these three which are if you believe the dea scheduling the worst possible drugs imaginable because by definition they must have a high addiction for potential and they serve no medical benefit whatsoever so take them in any order you like well let's take the psychedelics first because that's how it all started i mean these drugs were banned not because they had any negative impact they were bound in the face of opposition bobby kennedy confronted the dea and the fda when they said we want to ban lsd and he said hang on a second hang on we spent billions of dollars researching lsd up till this time and we got loads of positive results in fact his wife is he's still the age when he was having this discussion with them was he still the attorney general of the united states no no no he was uh he was secretary of state he was about to get elected president yeah this was this was okay later on yeah just be just before he was assassinated okay and he's saying to these come on guys we've had 15 years of this remarkable research which we've invested nih in the states funded over 130 grants to study the therapeutic use of lsd and they found it was very therapeutic and very little harms and and then the dea come in and cia come and say we've got about it he's saying what we're talking about and of course what they were talking about was was the fact that the hippie movement was starting and the hippie movement was anti the war in vietnam and lsd was seen as fueling the hippie movement but also worse than that it was changing music and people were dressing differently and putting flowers in their hair and and they were sticking flowers down the guns of the soldiers that were trying to stop them protesting the war you know it was changing the whole tenor i suppose what you might call sort of intellectual debate in america particularly in the amongst students and it was seen as a real threat to the american way of of doing everything which was basically having bigger and better bombs and guns and so lsd got banned because it was essentially changing the way people voted people didn't want to vote for war and they had but they couldn't ban in those days there were rules which said basically you had to have to find harms and those harms could be physical harms or they could be social harms and it's very easy to find social harms because you just get a few editors of your national inquirer or similar rags to just invent stories about the harms you know and the way people have been corrupted by using lsd and these wonderful i mean it's sad but you know but but it's amusing now but of course very damaging these front covers of these magazines or newspapers making absurd claims about lsd usually with semi-naked women and and that was enough concern if editors are socially concerned then we can bound the drug and it got banned and once lsd got banned all the other serotonergic hallucinogens that were known about at the time and actually in america you did know about quite a lot a lot of countries didn't know there were more than lsd and cytoside so some countries didn't ban dmt or 5-methoxy but you americans you just banned it all because you had good scientists so lsd was banned for political and social reasons no not because of any harm if tim leary had not been around would it still have been banned in your opinion probably not i think the fact that he was encouraging a fundamental change in the the american way of life through using drugs i think he certainly compounded the problem uh and he certainly popularized nst and encouraged people to to think differently about society i think that would i think there was a genuine fear that americans would actually cease to want to fight wars and actually want to have peace and that was just seen as being extremely bad for the american economy and of course the american presence internationally so prior to the scheduling of lsd you mentioned over 130 grants had been issued to study it this was a drug that had been manufactured in the late 1930s by the pharmaceutical company sandos what were some of the things that they had learned about lsd under that period of time in which it was studied rigorously so there were 40 000 patients studied a thousand papers were published and there have been analyses of many of these groups of patients and and they discovered that it actually was very safe if anything it reduced suicide rates compared with non-treatment and you've got to remember at the time in the 50s and 60s there were very few alternatives and particularly antidepressants hadn't been really invented till the 1960s it was shown to be effective and and it was shown to be safe and it didn't cause psychosis so actually it was this was the revolution this was the beginning the dawning of a new office of real psychiatry psychiatry was becoming like the rest of medicine we had tools that we could help people with other than talking and and in what context david so so would that be like a single dose of lsd combined with a prolonged period of psychotherapy uh during the period of time under which the influ the the individual's under the influence or did it require multiple treatments i mean do you have a sense of what require what was required for that efficacy but it was used in two different ways so in the states the the typical use was that what how we're using it today which is give people a biggest dose give them a big trip few hour trip and then afterwards help them work out what the trip meant so it was always done in the context of psychotherapy because because in those days all american psychiatrists were actually effectively mostly freudian analysts so it was always done in the context of psychotherapy it was allowed but in britain and we tended we often use lower doses and we use that repeatedly to try to break down psychological resistance to actually engaging in psychotherapy and what was the difference in those doses david so the big trip dose would be how many micrograms so for lsd it would have been 100 or 125 okay and then for the for the you know for um opening up the reducing the resistance we would say in psychotherapy breaking down the resistance it would be perhaps 25 micrograms and is 25 micrograms perceptible or is that considered a micro dose where the individual no that's perceptible anything over 10 micrograms is perceptible okay even 10 a lot of people can discriminate 10 not in the scent not because they're psychedelic but they they something's different feel that yeah feel things yes exactly and in the case that you described in the uk how many treatments at that lower level and at what interval were typically necessary to produce the benefits well they'd be weekly and they'd be maybe for you know 10 15 20 treatments so it's a just an unbelievable loss to the scientific community when lsd becomes scheduled absolutely could i just say one other thing i mean the the perhaps the biggest loss of all is relation to alcoholism a lot of people don't realize that the the founder of alcoholics anonymous bill wilson he escaped his alcoholism he broke free from the chains as he described it he escaped the chains of his alcoholism through a psychedelic experience and and then that was before lsd and then when lsd came along it was legal he tried it and he said wow this drug could help lots of alcoholics escape from this belief that the only thing that matters to them is alcohol it could give them a sense that there is more that it is possible to change and he was he persuaded or was it instrumental in six trials of lsd for alcoholism that were conducted in the states so one or two doses in people with alcoholism and a few years ago a couple of norwegians went back and they dug out the old data and they did it put it through a modern meta-analysis collate all the data you got an effect size of one which is twice that of any subsequent treatment for alcoholism lsd was a revolution in the treatment of alcoholism now in the 50 years since celestia's been banned you know you can make a rough calculation worldwide over a hundred million people have died prematurely from alcohol use disorder and if lsd helped perhaps just 10 percent of them that would be 10 million lives saved now you ask the question well how many lives have been saved from the ban well i'm not sure honestly maybe let's say let's say globally maybe maybe 50 50 lives a year have been saved because fewer people took it possibly so then you say you know we've got 50 years times there's two and a half thousand lives saved and 10 million lives lost so the the equation is so balanced against the decision that was made it it really i think it's the worst censorship of research in the history of the world and what are the typical harms of lsd is it basically self-harm inadvertently through people who are tripping to such an extreme level that they you know you hear these stories wow this guy thought he could fly and he jumped off a building sure well the cia were very good at promoting those stories but they're they're okay unquestionably people do dangerous things when they're taking lsd in dangerous places and we should mitigate against that and i can promise you when we do psychedelic therapy we lock the door so they can't judge okay here's a statistic in britain and i imagine it's even way worse in the states each year in britain probably 20 to 30 people die jumping usually drunk from peers or breakwaters or even from hotel balconies into the swimming pool so probably more people die each year jumping from alcohol which says nothing of automotive accidents and liver toxicity and respiratory depression but just the jumpings okay so lsd if you take lsd in a dangerous situation with people who are also tripping and you're not got someone to look after you then of course it's you know there is a risk but when lsd was used in these 40 thousand patients in hospitals there was there was very little evidence of any harm at all okay let's talk about its cousin psilocybin yes psilocybin of course has been around a lot longer sort of cybin is a present in mushrooms there are about 200 species of magic mushrooms different ones in different parts of the world uh it was it was really the beginnings of the psychedelic revolution where lsd and hoffman and um gordon watson the american mycologist who discovered a a tribe in mexico that were using mushrooms for psychedelic experiences and and actually went and exposed them and actually rather destroyed their culture by making it a target for for tourism so psychedelic mushrooms have been around forever because mushrooms have been around away before humans one of the interesting theories about hinduism you often often wonder you know why the hindu gods have so many arms probably because the first people that became hindus have been using this this cocktail called soma which of course was the term was adopted by aldous huxley and bravely word but but the real soma was a powerful mixture probably of magic mushrooms of ephedra and cannabis you mix that a lot together it's not surprising your elephants have five heads and four arms so so magic mushrooms have been around in many cultures for for millennia the cytosine has been the active ingredient was also discovered by hoffman because watson went in and said why is this causing hallucinations like lsd and he said oh well because it looks a bit like serotonin a bit like lsd and um and we've been working now with psylocybin um for a number of reasons the the the main one is that um it doesn't have the stigma lsd you say lsd to a politician and they immediately turn off you know they lsd is a bad thing whereas cytosimin they don't know how to say it they don't have to spell it they don't know what you're talking about and who's how can you be worried about magic that's only a mushroom the second reason we started using cytosim was because we didn't have safety really good safety data on any of these but we did know that in britain magic mushrooms were legal until 2005 and we knew about a million young people a year were using mushrooms and we persuaded our regulators they could let us use mushrooms because that body of evidence of safety was adequate and they said okay what led to the scheduling only 15 years ago i mean what what was happening that in 2005 they said we've got to ban this thing it's complicated so the active ingredient psilocybin was banned in 71 alongside lsd dmt but the mushrooms weren't banned why would you ban the mushrooms they don't have much of it and who cares if people are going to go and lie on the side of a mountain and you know see pretty pictures in the sky but what happened was that a couple of uh head shops in camden town north london started selling freeze-dried mushrooms so they would concentrate the dose like you could take more of it or was it just the fact that it was being sold commercially in the headshot it could be sold in london and so no one really cares if people go and you know line up you know on a hillside in devon that's quite fun but if someone's selling a dangerous psychedelic drug to our young people in london the right-wing press just went ape and we had these are probably the same shops that sold doc martens by the way because i know those head shops they're very dangerous places yeah absolutely that's right and it was a classic example of political expediency the tory party had lost the third election in a row to the labour party tony blair's labor party and they brought in a new guy called david cameron and david cameron had spoken previously about you know he'd use drugs and uh and uh he was in favor of drug reform but as soon as he became leader of the tory party he became anti-drugs because that's what he was told to do and he saw these newspaper headlines head shops corrupting our young people and he started goading the labor party yeah soft on drugs you're soft on drugs you know look they're selling this this illegal the drug wasn't illegal but the mushrooms weren't illegal but they made out they were and tony blair instead of saying don't be stupid he did what many liberal leaning politicians do in fact exemplified in your country by clinton clinton was the guy that was told the democrats had to be harder on drugs than the republicans and he's the guy with the three strikes that you're imprisoned forever and the same with labor they were told if you're not tougher on drug or as tough as the tories you're going to lose the election so he goaded blair into making the mushrooms illegal and he did it without consulting us and without he actually broke the law but we discovered that actually governments are allowed to do that if you take even if you take them to court they could just change the law to prove it you know to allow them to have done what they did so so yes so the mushrooms are now illegal as well as the active ingredient and then mdma itself is not really a classic psychedelic you know there's sort of a framework for these psychedelics where you've got the kind of the typical the atypical um but sort of if you have sort of psilocybin lsd here you've got mdma here more of an in pathogen and then you have ketamine as more of a dissociative and then these really atypical ones like ibogaine which we've already talked about so so um let's spend just a minute on mdma because again i i think it's one that well first of all people confuse mdma and ecstasy a little bit and i it's probably worth clarifying the nuances there uh but also talking about the potential that it has i i've had you know rick doblin on the podcast before so we've gone incredibly deep on the benefits of you know treatment for ptsd and we've talked a lot about maps we don't need to go that deep but just for someone who maybe hasn't heard that what would be the overview well mdma is a great american invention yep one of your top drug chemists sasha shulgin was interested in derivatives of amphetamines and he mdma was made you know back in 1904 as a possible agent for blood clotting but it never never got used and sheldon made it in the in the 60s and said wow this drug is different from amphetamines it's not activating it's not it's not driving me like amphetamines it's actually making it's giving me a clarity of thought but also a sense of warmness and empathy so he gave it to his wife and she said wow this is a very you know this is empathy this would be really useful in psychotherapy and couples counseling it would help potentially help break down you know those layers of irritation and grit that build up in relationships sometimes put people back into love and it was widely used for about 10 years by therapists particularly in the west coast of the states and it was called empathy and everything was fine and then some smart ass in texas decided this is a legal drug and we could sell this we can't sell amphetamines but we can sell ecstasy because it's legal but who wants to buy ecstasy so they change the name to ecstasy so they didn't want to buy empathy sorry they changed the name to ecstasy you've got an amphetamine which can help keep you active but also make you much more in love with uh with other people and it became you know widely used what's you know it's the perfect drug for parties isn't it you know you've got energy but you're also happy with you're not fighting people like what you do if you're taking speed and it became hugely popular and it spread into europe and then of course it just riled the right the puritans it riled the right-wing press the idea that young people could have ecstasy well when the newspaper owners couldn't even had never had it and couldn't even remember didn't even know what it meant they just didn't you had this moral outrage which eventually got the drug banned but again you couldn't in america and britain in those days you couldn't ban a drug just because kids liked it you had to find evidence of harm and some of the worst science has ever been done is the science proving or supposedly proving that mdma is harmful and culminating in that an amazing experiment that was done by riccardi which is very embarrassing for johns hopkins you know when he claimed that taking mdma and listening to the poges overnight gave monkeys brain damage and we all said well hang on a second none of our kids are coming out of the clubs with brain damage i think your experiment's wrong ricardi he said no no it's right look ecstasy causes brain damage and he got published in science despite the fact the referee said this is this has got to be wrong and of course eventually they went back and they audited what they'd done instead of giving the monkeys mdma they've given him crystal meth which is way better that paper that paper was recall i mean he he did have to pull that paper didn't he he didn't no no he didn't retract the paper he was never attracted i think you can still find it if you look in science you'll still find it's there it's not struck out i think we'll just find there's a there's a correction sorry guys this wasn't mdma this was actually methamphetamine wow so that's that's that's our answer to andrew wakefield for you huh yeah indeed and it's it's embarrassing really because well for all sorts of reasons because it's so much american science is paid by the government that the uh apparently i don't know i heard that the editor of the magazine science was told by senators that the american academy of science which runs a journal would not get government funding if he didn't put that paper in and get it published to deter young people from using mdma of course all that happens is in the end young people young people think this doesn't make sense and then they discover they've been lied to so are they going to listen to anything else the government tells them um let's talk briefly about ketamine before we come back to psilocybin because i want to i want to sort of double click more on psilocybin specifically with um with the for the treatment of depression but uh just to round out all of our sort of psychedelics ketamine of course is the only drug on this list that is legal so it's i believe it's a schedule three perhaps a schedule four used as an anesthetic typically and it's quite dissociative so can you can you talk i guess specifically about the use of ketamine in treatment resistant depression which seems to be one of the more promising areas of research yes a wonderful story and and it goes back to um to john crystal who's a professor up at yale and he was using ketamine to model psychosis and he was comparing ketamine and thc um to model psychosis they both produce altered states of consciousness which sort of you know have some overlap with psychosis but he noticed that afterwards his volunteers often felt better you know they actually came out of the ketamine experience saying well that was weird but they had an improved mood and he thought maybe this is mood elevating so then he and his colleagues went on a little study yeah ketamine elevates mood and for a couple of days after a ketamine trip your mood is definitely improved and now there have been about 30 studies showing that ketamine can um have have a value particularly if you add it on to other treatments of depression which have not been very successful so if people are partially recovered give a bit of ketamine and their mood gets better um the problem with ketamine compared with what we're going to talk about in a minute with cytosimin is the effect is very short-lasting it lasts only two or three days so currently what you have now is a licensed medicine janssen decided to to pursue this because this was the first real breakthrough in the treatment of depression for really for 50 years so they said that but you couldn't patent ketamine because ketamine has been was being used back in the vietnam war as a bloody drug when people were being blown up and having it as a use as an analgesic so they took the enantiomer one of the isomers of ketamine called s the s enantiomer and equal s ketamine and they formulated it for nasal inhalation so you don't have to inject it which is better and easier for psychiatrists and now that soul is a treatment and it's called s keto means bravate and it works and you take it a couple of times a week and then gradually over time you use you dose less and less as as so you don't develop a tachyphylaxis to it it actually if you do it twice a week you don't no no and and you are able to get patients off of it while still preserving the anti-depressive benefits that's less clear but in some that's true but it does have there is an advantage of it over ketamine ketamine clinics tend to they give it intravenously or intramuscular intravenously yeah or intramuscularly but also the problem there is that you know ketamine is a dependence-producing drug it's a drug a recreational drug um you know is relatively popular in britain it's relatively popular in china um probably popular also in the states i'm not sure what the stats are um the problem is you do get tolerant stacking phylaxis if you use it regularly so while it's relatively safe in the doses you might use you know maybe you know you know 500 milligrams for depression if people are using it recreationally and taking more and more they're getting up to grams a day and then you get into serious problems you get bladder problems you get basically you get a severe chronic cystitis which can cause bladder atrophy needing blood resection and you also get a psychological state you get a kind of you can get brain damage or at least you can get a state of of severe cognitive impairment which actually rather mimics schizophrenia so so heavy use of ketamine is actually really to be avoided and what defines that i mean those are very scary things you just described obviously the the psychiatric component much more than the urologic um what what what is too much i mean because i'll tell you this is something i get asked a lot um hey you know i'm i'm going to this ketamine clinic once a month it's it's changing my life uh you know and i don't is you know at what point does that become too much oh yeah well certainly daily use is too much so i mean people are addicted to ketamine are using it four or five times a day they might be using five grams a day and that that's when you get into the serious brain damage so i think twice a week oh i think we know from from scattering twice a week seems to be without uh it doesn't have any injury but if you're not using the enantiomer twice a week will probably still produce a tachyphylaxis and a diminishing return at some point yes but this one are they really interesting questions and we don't understand this why is it that when people use ketamine and they get tachyphylaxis they can overcome it by taking more by the way i should explain to people what tachyphylaxis is because we're using the term without me defining it it's uh it's it's of course when the same amount of a medication produces a lesser and lesser effect or when you require more and more of a medication to produce the same effect so for example we don't generally get tachyphalactic to tylenol right the acetaminophen if you take 500 milligrams and your headache goes away you know the next time you take 500 milligrams it does about the same thing um so to your point you can sort of over you can push the dose a little bit and and and stay ahead of it with ketamine correct you can you can like heroin like fentanyl you can you can overcome the tolerance but with psychedelics you can't and that's an interesting phenomenon and it's probably to do with subtle changes in the in the downstream mechanisms in the cells that you know you get almost complete absence of effects of psychedelics after two or three doses and you know who told us that the us government so the u.s government were very interested in or fearful actually when psychedelics came around in the 50s they thought well maybe the russians will be spraying lsd on our troops so how can we protect our troops from nsd so they started giving troops lst to find out what the effects would be to see how they could have bought them and they discovered by the third day of giving the troops celestine lsd had no effect anymore i didn't realize that was the case so if you're talk if you're talking 250 micrograms of lsd at some point people are going to stop responding to that yeah but the second dose will be less than the f if you take it every day the second dose is way less but what if you're taking it once a month for example or no no no it takes about a week to recover the the effect disappears between about one and two weeks so it's not a lifelong tachyphylaxis it's very temporal no although some people do say well a lot of people say that for all drugs the first one's always the best yeah but you can't overcome the tachyphylaxis with psychedelics whereas you can with heroin and you can with ketamine and why that is is not we're not so clear as to why that is all right well there's so many more questions i have about this david but i know we have a very hard stop today so i want to make sure we have some time to talk about your most recent work with psilocybin and depression about three months ago a study was published in new england journal medicine you were the senior author on that paper i've written about it at length which compared psilocybin to lexapro a very very popular commonly used reasonably well tolerated ssri um do you want to just give people a quick overview of the study design and what you set out to test i'd be pleased to yes so previously we had done a study an open trial we'd taken 20 people with resistant depression and we'd given them a single psilocybin trip and found very good outcome uh but the effect didn't last very long it lasted you know one to two months but for many of them the depression came back uh based on that and also some theoretical work i've done with robin carhart harris who was with me at the time he's now moved to ucsf we came to the conclusion that psychedelics treat depression in a different way to antidepressants and the papers published in journal psychopharmacology it's called a tale of two receptors it's a free download uh feel free to read it because it conceptualizes that there are two ways you can lift depression one way is with it with with lexapro or other similar drugs that enhance serotonin in the limbic system and there they basically block the stress response and we know that stress is a major cause of depression you block stress induce depressive changes in that system and that allows the limbic system to recover so that it's a bit like if you have a broken leg you set the leg in plaster so that the bone can heal itself ssris set the limbic system in plaster so over a period of six to eight weeks they can heal and get you over your depression and that's through a particular subtype of serotonin receptors called the serotonin 1a receptor which is in the very expressed in the limbic system but we think psychedelics we know psychedelics work in the cortex and they disrupt cortical processing and disrupt we think the deep persistent ruminations and negative thoughts of depression so we said let's do a study where we take depressed people we scan them with fmri before and after and then we see if we can look at if the brain changes are different with the acetalopram compared with the cytoside being predicting that we would see cortical differences that the cortex would be changed by the cytosine and the subcortical regions will be changed by the acetanoprim so the primary aim of the study was to see if there were differences in brain mechanisms but of course we have to know whether there are differences in outcome so we compared the the the mood changing effects of these two drugs but you couldn't just say hey you're on lexapro here you're on side of simone we had to blind it and that's quite difficult with psychedelics so the way we got we did that was to tell everyone they were going to get cytoscybin but half the group got a low dose a placebo dose of one milligram dose and have got a high dose of 25 milligram dose but they all went through the same psychotherapy depending it didn't matter what dose they got they all got all the same preparation and the psychotherapy that goes with a high dose of cytosimin and then they all got pills but the acetalopram group got escottarapram and the um cytosine group got placebo so they're both getting two pills one is getting that's a placebo plus the high dose of psilocybin the other okay and the point of that is what's called critical equipoise people have to believe that they're getting the best they can and and then and and we gave them two doses of cytosine whether high or low one at starting one after three weeks to see how long the effect would last and then we measured changes in in mood and we measured side effects and we also looked at other aspects of of depression rather than just looking at depression scores we also looked at things like well-being which is a different way of of looking at how people are feeling and in the end on the the primary measure there was no difference that cytosine at six weeks was as good uh as um or equal to as uh escitalopram on that particular measure which was a a particular self-report measure called the quid self-report which has been used quite extensively in research in the states particularly in the star d study but when we looked at all the other measures uh actually cyber cyber did rather well yeah so i want to pause on that for a sec because um i i think that the paper was undersold a little bit i i think it was it it read as a negative study um as opposed to a non-inferiority study um what why do you think that happened do you do you think that there was a mistake in the way that that either the journal treated that or even the way you treated that as the authors yeah that's a great question a very perceptive question uh it's a question i think you should ask the editors of the new england journal so the reality was the truth was it wasn't it wasn't powered for non-inferiority if you want a proper non-inferiority study in psychiatry takes a hundred and fifty patients in each arm we could never afford to do that there's very few that we've ever been done except by what probably none have been done except by companies we could not statistically do a non-inferiority study so we had to just do a kind of comparison and uh and the answer was that well we we had to pre we you know use pre-specify we've pre-specified two outcomes the quids and the well-being and it did brilliantly on their well-being but because that's kind of not well that's sort of soft wishy-washy psychiatry we they insisted that we use the quiz as the primary now when they if you don't meet this is a bit statistical sort of uh jargon really but if you don't meet your primary you're not allowed to report the secondaries it's kind of it's absolute it's it's it's purism it's puristic statistics but as you as you say it's kind of not very intuitive because when you look at it actually it was very clear that the overall many m well there was not a single measure that favored essentially well that's that's sort of the thing is i you know i read the paper in great detail and my takeaway was this is very promising because i'm very familiar with with lexapro and i'm very familiar with its efficacy but i'm also very familiar with its side effects and the baggage that comes with it most people you know for for the listener lexapro is typically given at two doses 10 milligrams or 20 milligrams going from 10 to 20 there is a sizable increase in the efficacy but there's also a sizable increase in the side effects many of them sexual and when we're talking about treating young people old people middle-aged people you fix their depression but you destroy their libido you're you're trading one problem for another often and the the the list of patients i've you know taken care of who can't tolerate these drugs despite the benefit that they're receiving from an anti-depressive or anti-anxiolytic standpoint is significant so so to me i read that study with enormous optimism right which is if there is a way to give somebody 25 milligrams of psilocybin and get the same anti-depressive benefits but without these other side effects this is very exciting this needs to be explored a heck of a lot further do you think that the study at least accomplished that as as an outcome yeah so people have said well why didn't you fight back with a journal why didn't you demand you know that they were more positive and and the answer is from my perspective being the first ever psychedelic study in the new england journal of medicine tells the world that cytosine is a medicine and it's as good as lexapro and if anyone who reads the paper can see that it does do better on sexual dysfunction and it does do better on many of the other uh issues that nexopro has a problem with and that it fits with the theory that one of the things it's very the reason lexapro and other ssris dampen down sexual activity is because they dampen down the limbic system which is the part of the brain which drives those behaviors and also people on these drugs often say yes i don't feel depressed anymore i don't i don't i don't cry i i don't have the distress that comes from seeing sad things on the tv but they also say but also i don't enjoy life as much because i'm kind of my my pleasures are blunt today right up in the bottom exactly exactly whereas silocybin is stopping the thinking and allowing the rest of your brain to work normally a word on micro dosing uh david you know people it even i even had to go back and do the conversion so when i was reading the study i was going what does 25 milligrams of psilocybin mean because typically when people are taking psilocybin we're giving it to them in the whole mushroom and that's typically like five grams so of course then i had to get really deep in the weeds and figure out which species of mushroom and what the conversion is but the point is 25 milligrams of pure psilocybin is on par with about four to five grams of magic mushrooms and therefore it is truly a psychedelic experience what is known about the imperceptible dose uh you know like a hundred milligrams of magic mushroom or you know one to two milligrams of pure psilocybin and its potential for antidepressant benefits well loads of people use it loads of people you know they go pick the mushrooms they dry the mushrooms and they uh they take them i i'll give you a i was talking at a festival a couple of years ago in wales uh it's it's it's called how the light gets in and it's a big intellectual music music festival and after my talk a lady came up to me and she said yeah i've got to cheer you the euro i'm a i'm a nurse she says i got a kid it's difficult i mean i'm not married she says but uh i get up every morning you know and i get the kid to school and i come back she says i have a cigarette a cup of coffee and a mushroom and i've been really good for the last few years and and and there's anecdotally there's large numbers of people who are using these mushrooms do they work or not it's we don't know because it's almost the rules around these drugs the schedule one status means that a single mushroom is just as illegal is as illegal as a bunch of mushrooms or as a pure as pure cytocyber four years ago we got ethical permission to do a micro dosing study with lsd but they said this is an illegal drug a dangerous drug every micro dose had to be given in hospital and then we costed up what it would take to buy all that time in hospitals to do six weeks of microdosing we couldn't afford it and so there has never been a proper controlled microdosing study of any repeatedly of any psychedelic but from a mechanism of action standpoint david do you do you see a plausible path to it to micro dosing being effective given what you now know about macro dosing well it won't be as good obviously not a single microdose won't be remotely but say repeatedly because i believe in your study they were given this macro dose every two weeks correct twice every two three weeks apart yeah that's right so but if we were talking about micro dosing three or four times a week at you know one to two milligrams and we're talking about this type of a treatment over the course of a year so apples to apples time wise is there a plausibility here that you can see from a mechanism standpoint well it'd be a great experiment to do i mean i i think it is i mean i think i think it's ethical to do that because i think it is plausible that micro dosing over a long period might do two things i would be slightly surprised if it really elevated mood in depressed people but it might protect people about people against a lowering of mood and so one of the interesting questions in fact in many ways the fundamental question we have now as a result of our two depression studies is not that we can get back people better there's no question with cytoside how can we keep them well and one of the great things we know about the ssris is if you take them continuously they do protect against depression they do protect against the stresses of life causing depression at the cost of blunting so the question is how what could we do other than give them an ssri after the psychedelic treatment and maybe micro dosing would work but until we get it liberated until we get it out of schedule one and get it available it's impossible to do those studies where do you think will be the thin end of the wedge to make that happen obviously roland griffiths has done great work at johns hopkins someone i'd like to have on the podcast as well um looking at psilocybin in end-of-life depression though i don't know where things are from a pathway perspective there's obviously efficacy with smoking cessation and alcohol cessation and now your work with depression which of these will be the first domino that falls in your opinion um to look to change the scheduling of psilocybin i think depression because a multi-center study is going on in europe and the us by the company called compass pathways and they're doing a dose-finding study they finished they've recruited the last subject uh they will get the results hopefully by christmas or the new year and that's a high-dose 25 milligram dose a placebo dose of one milligram dose like we did and a 10 milligram dose in between i think if that's positive then the floodgates will open to their second study and also to to funding of those that research now compass has come come under great scrutiny from some in their effort to you know basically do a land grab of intellectual property on a molecule that basically should be in the public domain how do you think about that in terms of the balancing the need to make something as widely available as possible to the public while at the same time needing to create an economic incentive to do so yes well of course i i have to express and i've been cons helping them for a lot i mean their compass pathways exist because of our first impression study you know they basically took our data and went and tried to do research with it and they started off being a bit like maps they started off trying to raise money uh by being a not-for-profit now rick doblin is a phenomenon but it has taken him 25 years to raise enough money to do the match phase three and come after a year or so compass pathways realized that they didn't have the resources or the skill or the personalities yeah rick's a force of nature he is and they realized that they couldn't be a not-for-profit they had to get the money for this to happen they had to go down the more conventional route and um so you know much as i would like it not to be the case you know reality is it i think if we want to see cytocyber with enough evidence in my lifetime to make it a medicine then i think that that they're most the people that most likely to deliver that but on the other side you've got oregon you've got oregon which voted in november last year to make to make mushrooms a medicine in two years time so so it's actually a bit of a race now to see who's going to win i uh it's uh i don't know what how are going to do it i just hope they do it carefully and sensibly but it might be that the mushroom ends up being the medicine rather than the side of simon it's exciting times david i promised you that at 6 00 p.m i would draw to an end and we are at 5 59 p.m so i'm going to stick to my word despite the fact that we are only halfway through what i wanted to
