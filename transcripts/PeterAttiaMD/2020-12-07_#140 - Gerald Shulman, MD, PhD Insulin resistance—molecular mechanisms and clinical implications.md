## Description

Gerald Shulman is a Professor of Medicine, Cellular & Molecular Physiology, and the Director of the Diabetes Research Center at Yale. His pioneering work on the use of advanced technologies to analyze metabolic flux within cells has greatly contributed to the understanding of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this episode, Gerald clarifies what insulin resistance means as it relates to the muscle and the liver, and the evolutionary reason for its existence. He goes into depth on mechanisms that lead to and resolve insulin resistance, like the role of diet, exercise, and pharmacological agents. As a bonus, Gerald concludes with insights into Metformin’s mechanism of action and its suitability as a longevity agent.

## AI Summary

I'll help structure a comprehensive analysis of this episode. Here's the first part:

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:
This episode features Dr. Gerald Shulman, a professor at Yale and pioneer in understanding insulin resistance and metabolism. The discussion focuses on the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance and its clinical implications. Dr. Shulman explains how he developed techniques using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study metabolism in living cells, providing unprecedented insights into how glucose and fat are processed in the body. The conversation covers the progression from early insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and their connections to other chronic diseases.

**KEY MEDICAL/SCIENTIFIC POINTS**:

- Insulin resistance affects approximately 25% of the population and is often asymptomatic [00:15:30]
- Muscle insulin resistance is the first defect seen in young, lean individuals, preceding liver problems [00:45:00]
- Diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation in cell membranes is a key driver of insulin resistance [01:15:00]
- The progression typically goes: muscle insulin resistance → fatty liver → hepatic insulin resistance → type 2 diabetes [00:55:00]
- Metformin's mechanism of action is likely through inhibition of mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, not complex 1 as previously thought [01:45:00]

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is dr gerald shulman cherry's a professor of medicine and cellular and molecular physiology at yale he's also the co-director of the yale diabetes research center in 2018 he received the banting medal for scientific achievement arguably the most prestigious award one can win in this field he's pioneered the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with mass spec to non-invasively examine cellular glucose and fat metabolism now you may ask why does that matter and we get to that right at the outset of this interview if you want to understand insulin resistance if you want to understand hyperinsulinemia type 2 diabetes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease you have to understand the movement of glucose and fat a way to think about this is to think about it this way if you go and get a blood test even the most fancy blood test imaginable you're basically looking at a picture a snapshot a moment in time what these techniques that jerry and his collaborators have developed over many years are basically allowing you to watch videos you can see the flux you can see the movement of glucose furthermore they've been able to see those things as they happen inside even human cells so i'm going to i guess maybe make an apology at the outset of this and say that this is about as technical an interview as i probably have done in a while there are probably only a few interviews that i've done on this podcast that get into more technical weeds than this one but unfortunately that is the price one has to pay if they want to understand arguably the most important pathologic condition in our species and i i get into what i mean by that in the interview so i won't elaborate on that further we talk a lot about what it is to be insulin resistant this term gets thrown around with such ubiquity that you'd think everybody knows what it means and yet to define it is very complicated but i think by the end of this interview you will undoubtedly understand how to define insulin resistance and i think you will have a very good sense of where it begins and what it means in a subclinical versus a clinical state and what the sequence of events are that lead to a condition in the muscle ultimately affecting the liver ultimately affecting the whole body i'm not going to promise you that you'll get that on the first listen i think that might require more than one listen and it probably requires going through the show notes which will be littered with fantastic figures in fact as jerry and i did this interview over zoom for i don't know i would say maybe half to two-thirds of the interview he was sharing slides as we were doing it and keep in mind i'm quite familiar with these concepts so for someone who's less familiar with these concepts i think it will be only that much more valuable one really nice little bonus thing that came out of this is a beautiful discussion at the end of metformin where i actually learned something really profound that was incredibly relevant to my understanding of metformin in my ongoing interest around the question of metformin's suitability as a longevity agent i could say more about this but i think it's just one of those things where i ask you to sort of take a leap of faith with me that this is important even if it feels a little bit like drinking your cough syrup at times but if you really want to understand longevity you're going to have to sort of figure out what insulin resistance means so without further delay please enjoy my very in-depth conversation with dr gerald shulman [Music] jerry thank you so much for making time to sit down virtually with me today as i said before we hopped on this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart and frankly all roads seem to point to you and that goes back to i don't know at least for me probably 2011 when i became really fascinated by this topic and there aren't a lot of topics where i've personally experienced the following problem which is the more i think i understand it the less i do so now when someone says to me peter what's insulin resistance you know i can sort of give glib answers to that question but the reality of it is i don't think i fully understand what it is and i don't know that i can represent to the listener that by the end of this they will fully understand what insulin resistance is but what i think they'll understand is how maybe we can think about it through the lens of different tissues and what may or may not be going on in large part i think that's due to the incredible work you've done over your entire career i guess i'd like to kind of just start with a little bit of background you did an md and a phd and you're trained as an endocrinologist correct yeah that's correct and then i did residency in medicine at duke fellowship and endocrinology at the mass general harvard and then i've always been interested in metabolism diabetes i guess probably my father was a diabetologist went to summer camp he was the doctor for type 1 diabetics at an early ages exposed to problems type one diabetes in my peers i was just a camper and saw my peers getting hypoglycemic or getting into issues with ketoacidosis so i think i was exposed to metabolism at an early age i'm sure it left an impression on me my father wanted me to become a radiologist because my physics background but i ended up staying in metabolism and doing endocrinology i'm sure you would have done great things in radiology but i also think we're far better off for the contributions you've made in this field when did this particular question of understanding what insulin resistance meant and actually starting to differentiate between some of these phenotypes of what is the fate of glucose in a person with normal metabolism versus what is the fate of ingested glucose and someone with type 2 diabetes when did that question begin to obsess you and specifically now that's a sort of change from the patients that you grew up with with type 1 diabetes studying as an undergraduate medical school i was always interested in biochemistry physiology i had an experience i was visiting a medical student at vanderbilt in the 70s and got interested in indivo metabolism doing studying metabolism in awake animals looking specifically at glucose and fatty acid turnover using tracers to actually measure how fast things are being made glucose is made how fast fatty acids are being made in the body and metabolized in medical training you go back to medical school you learn how to become a good doctor take care of patients but then in your fellowship years you're back in the lab and i really wanted to get back to understand metabolism by looking inside the cell so everything i had done prior to that and most people studying biochemistry physiology would to understand so diabetes metabolic disease i was interested in this question it's an important disease leading cause of blindness end stage renal disease leading cause of non-traumatic loss of limb the cost to u.s society is huge impact and now it's becoming a global problem as they adapt to westernized diets and things and i wanted to look inside the cell metabolism inside the cell so that took me into the world of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and actually brought me down to new haven where they were just setting up methods this technique to actually look inside living yeast cells i said gosh this we can adapt this to humans and look inside metabolism in humans in liver and muscle and other organs to specifically get at your question i think it's such an important metabolic disease the most common metabolic disease and so someone's interested in metabolism it's a natural segue i sometimes describe it to patients as the foundation upon which the major three chronic diseases sit so you described some ways in which patients with type 2 diabetes die specifically through amputations or complications of amputation such as infections and obviously through end-stage renal disease but i would argue that the majority of the mortality through diabetes comes not so much through diabetes but through its amplification of atherosclerotic disease cancer and dementia all of which are force multiplied in spades by type 2 diabetes so the way i explain it to people and i hope that by the end of this you'll help me refine this because it may not be accurate but i describe to patients that there is a continuum from hyperinsulinemia to impaired glucose disposal to nafld and nash to type 2 diabetes and that continuum makes up a plane upon which all chronic diseases get worse if we're going to be serious about the business of delaying the onset of death we have to be serious about the business of delaying the onset of chronic disease and if we want to do that we must fix our metabolisms that's my thesis total agreement you're spot on so insulin resistance is the main factor which leads to type 2 diabetes but it also and again this is give credit to jerry reaven who in his 1988 banting lecture first got everyone's interest in basically saying insulin resistance is not only leading to diabetes but as you say atherosclerosis basically hyperlipidemia associated with inflammation high uric acid polycystic ovarian disease now we can kind of add to that now we can talk about nafl or i prefer the term metabolic associated fatty liver disease methyl d that's going to be the most common cause of liver disease liver inflammation end-stage liver disease and liver cancer and finally another arm you know for jerry's circle of insulin resistance and all these arms budding off of them heart disease as we talked about high uric acid high triglycerides and high cholesterol is cancer so we're now as you know seen huge increases in many forms of cancers which are associated with obesity breast cancer colon cancer pancreatic cancer liver cancer and i had to bet it's insulin resistance that's driving the increase in all of these cancers now it's not causing them necessarily but it's promoting the growth and again we have very strong pre-clinical evidence for this in animals you can take animals rachel perry who was in my group and now starting her own lab has taken breast cancer models human breast cancer models colon cancer put them into mice and just giving them insulin putting an insulin pump just simply and that the rate of tumor growth is accelerated and you treat them with an insulin sensitizing agents and you can slow down tumor growth so i think you're spot on peter insulin resistance is driving a lot of disease and you're also spot on in that that's what's killing our patients with type 2 diabetes it is heart disease these other things are the chronic complications of hyperglycemia the blindness the end-stage renal disease and the small vessel disease leading to non-traumatic loss of limb also hyperglycemia but insulin resistance which is very common it's probably one quarter of our population and one half of our population has it perfectly asymptomatic you don't know you have it we can test for it using sophisticated tools that we can talk about but it's a very common phenomenon so before we launch into what i think is an important discussion around the fate of glucose under normal conditions which is the backdrop against which i think everything we are going to talk about has to be laid out i'd like you to spend a moment doing something you're probably not asked to do often which is at least explain to some extent what the nmr technique allows you to do because so much of what we're going to talk about today requires either a leap of faith that you know what you're talking about or at least some sense of how a scientist is able to actually look at substrates and substrate utilization and substrate movement in the ways that we have to be able to talk about them at a molecular and cellular level to make sense so i know it's a bit complicated but because it is such a cornerstone of your work can you explain what labeling means and how you can measure those labeled molecules in vivo in metabolism the traditional methods since going back to dates maybe 50 years ago when you wanted to measure more than just concentration of a metabolite you go to your doctor you measure blood sugar cholesterol and it's a static concentration and what we know is what's much more important than just measuring concentration is flux and that's basically production versus uptake by a tissue and know where something's being made where it's going and the traditional approach has been to put a label on that whatever you're interested in tracing uh glucose and so you used to basically with the advent of cyclotrons was really started in california in berkeley they started you know had cyclotrons they're interested in nuclear theory the side product is you can make isotopes so you can make carbon radio labeled so it's an emitter and put that carbon onto a glucose molecule and then trace it so for more than 50 years we've been able to buy radio labeled isotopes and put a in c14 which is radioactive low dose radiation or tritium which is a form of hydrogen and then give it to a person animal and do blood sampling and actually measure then turnover of that metabolite so that's telling that's very important information many many important studies have used this and sedates we still use this to track production and clearance of whatever we're labeling what you can't get from that though is really what's happening inside the cell which is really where i wanted to go so we've been measuring turnover of metabolites and again that's what i did many years ago when i first started my interest in metabolism to do that you need to get inside and look at the cell so the approaches have been traditionally something called positron emission tomography which is now used clinically sometimes to track tumor growth because tumors take up glucose you can give a pet emitter of glucose and see if the tumor is taking it up that's radio active and again i'm a clinical physiologist i prefer not to give radio labeled substrates radioactive substrates to volunteers who volunteer for my study the other approach was nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy there you know we're two groups that were pioneering this kind of work there was one group in george rada at oxford and this was phosphor cenomar and so what george was doing so nmr takes advantage of the fact that the nuclei of certain atoms have spin properties and i won't get into all the physics behind this but they make them behave like tiny bar magnets and so when you put them in a strong magnetic field they tend to line up or against this magnetic field and because they have spin properties they will actually precess in this magnetic field at a set frequency if you pulse them at the frequency that they're precessing they tip out of this field and then when they relax they emit energy that you can pick up with a little radi with an antenna and basically get chemical information about where that label is within the molecule so everything i just said all you need to understand is you can use this method to basically measure the amount of the metabolite more importantly which for example carbon atom within that glucose molecule is labeled it has something called chemical shift it experiences a slightly different magnetic field depending where it is within that glucose molecule so for the listeners all you need to understand is using this method we're able to get biochemical information of not only measuring a metabolite but then using the power of for example c13 nmr track the label as it's being metabolized inside the cell so that's carbon nmr so in our bodies 99 of the carbon in our body is c12 which is nmr invisible but one percent is c13 which is nmr visible has this precession properties you can use a labeled for example c1 labeled glucose and then track that c1 glucose as it gets into the say a muscle cell or liver cell and gets metabolized and finds its way into glycogen and then you can measure flux you can actually for the first time in humans non-invasively without any ionizing radiation measure how much is going in through measure intracellular pathway flux phosphorous cenomar is getting back to george roddy george pioneered phosphorus nmr there you don't have to give any isotopes there you actually see p31 phosphorus 31 is 100 natural abundant you see all the phosphorus that's in solution in our bodies so for example when our volunteers go into slide a magnet and we put a leg or arm into the magnet we can see all the high energy phosphates in for example atp adenosine triphosphate there are three phosphates and you can actually see each one of those phosphates you can see phosphocreatine has a different chemical shift you can see inorganic phosphate and we develop methods doug rothman and others at yale who i work with we're able to develop methods measure glucose 6-phosphate so we can actually look at one a key intermediate getting glucose from outside inside another method we developed was we can measure intracellular glucose inside human muscle non-invasively so by measuring these metabolites measuring flux we can actually then ask the very simple questions which this is how we started out in humans as you say you know again diabetes is a abnormality of metabolism glucose is the metabolite and we were able to basically ask very simple questions when a person a human which is my favorite model because it's the one most relevant to understanding diabetes and metabolic disease when we ingest carbohydrate how much of that carbohydrate ends up in glycogen versus oxidation into carbon dioxide or gets converted to lactate through glycolysis and so and then more importantly in the patient with or the volunteer with diabetes how important is that pathway glucose to glycogen accounting for their insulin resistance this story is very short before you go there let's demonstrate clinically a difference between these two people so let's take the normal patient without type 2 diabetes and then let's contrast them with a very similar person of similar size who has type 2 diabetes we will feed them both a high carbohydrate meal in the evening let's just assume that that meal contains 100 to 200 grams of carbohydrate they will digest their food we won't really have much insight into what's happening overnight you will tell us but at the next morning we do a fasting blood glucose level on them this is now 12 hours after their meal the patient who does not have type 2 diabetes might arrive with a blood sugar of 100 milligrams per deciliter which we will say is normal his counterpart with type 2 diabetes may actually at that time have a blood sugar of 200 milligrams per deciliter which is obviously abnormal and consistent with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes now of course that only represents about an extra 5 grams of glucose in the circulation that is the difference between the 100 and the 200 milligrams per deciliter which is a small fraction of the call it one to two hundred milligrams pardon me grams rather five gram difference so it's a small fraction of what was ingested the night before what is the difference between those two people why does one of them have such a hard time with that extra five grams of glucose what was the fate of glucose in the healthy person to begin with how did the body treat it the body when you take in and again this is what we were able to demonstrate by actually measuring glycogen flux and liver and muscle that ingested in a healthy individual ends up as mostly liver and muscle glycogen it takes up muscle and depends on the size of the meal and how it's being administered the proportionality between liver and muscle but the bottom line it's 80 90 percent is stored as glycogen in the diabetic contrast is there's two processes that have gone awry one is that the liver is geared up to make more glucose than it should be through a process called gluconeogenesis the conversion of non-glucose precursors like amino acids alanine lactate to glucose and that process is accelerated so the liver is making twice the amount of glucose as it should and then you have a block in the periphery where the glucose same amount of insulin is not causing the glucose to be taken up by the muscle again in terms of flux what i care most about production is up and clearance or disappearance is down and besides this also even in some diabetics insulin is inappropriately low because we know if we give more insulin we can overcome these abnormalities and so the beta cell has also become abnormal in the established diabetic where it's not making enough insulin that can be secondary to these other issues glucose toxicity and other factors that have caused this beta cell impairment because we know most importantly when we reverse the insulin resistance this is a very important study is we've taken these type 2 diabetics and short-term hypocaloric feeding 1200 calories a day we basically can reverse all these abnormalities through reduction in the topic lipid which we can get into molecular mechanisms and reverse their diabetes and this has now been shown by many many other investigators and most recently roy taylor my colleague who trained with us is now doing this in the primary care clinic back in the uk but usually you've asked the question usually when we talk about diabetes actually it's it may be easier to understand when you start in the young lean 20 year old who already has insulin resistance these are the young lean college students that we study it's actually easier i think for your listeners to understand if we start with just pure insulin resistance which we see is the most common thing as i said probably half the people in the u.s actually have insulin resistance don't know it because they're asymptomatic and we even see this in young lean 20 year olds yale undergraduates who volunteer for our studies profound insulin resistance in muscle no problems in liver and then take you through the progression from how you just go from insulin resistance and muscle to fatty liver and insulin resistance in the liver and then progress to type 2 diabetes that's something we can actually go through that would be of interest it would because it actually kind of fits with the way i was going to try to temporarily split this which would look as follows when we take a patient who has normal fasting glucose and normal fasting insulin and we challenge them with an oral glycemic load and then measure insulin and glucose in 30 minute intervals a lot of times we expose a problem that seems most easily explained by the muscle's inability to assimilate glycogen so a person shows up and they have a normal fasting insulin say it's five and their fasting glucose is say 90. you challenge them with 75 to 100 grams of glucose but say 30 or 60 minutes later their fasting glucose is 200 their insulin is 70. we call that insulin resistance and we impute from that that something has broken down in the pathway that prevents their muscle from taking in glucose now you've done very elegant work to examine all of the possible places that failure could have taken place did it take place at the glute iv transporter or one of the mechanisms which we should discuss how the glut4 transporter gets across the cell membrane is it a problem not of bret bringing glucose in but really is the problem downstream at hexokinase or glycogen synthase things like that so is that sort of what you're saying which is can we start with postprandial hyperglycemia yeah i think we're not even hyperglycemia this is before any abnormal just insulin resistance what i like about the question you asked and how you pointed out insulin resistance is the root cause for not only diabetes but it's going to be the root cause for all these other abnormalities fatty liver disease make us prone makes a lot of cancers worse heart disease and again that's the number one killer in this country it's insulin resistance that's driving all these things and not even talking about even though i'm a diabetologist i of course care i want to fix diabetes but even before blood sugar goes up which is how we define diabetes let's understand insulin resistance because if we can understand insulin resistance then that's going to be the best way to fix diabetes type 2 diabetes heart disease going to make a big impact there fatty liver disease and slow down cancers so let's start with insulin resistance okay what is insulin resistance so we define it by giving insulin and we know insulin normally does some effects makes glucose being taken up by liver and muscle and when that same amount of insulin is not doing these things we say there's insulin resistance you need more insulin than to cause muscle to take up glucose or the liver to turn off glucose production or take up glucose and the same thing again in the fat cell what insulin does in the fat cell is that puts the brake on break down a fat it's called that lipolysis or take up glucose to esterify fatty acids into glucose so these are the three key insulin responsive organs and when insulin is not doing that properly we call that insulin resistance and again keep emphasizing i think for your listeners this is probably every other person in this country and or in western europe are insulin resistant your doctor won't even know this unless they do careful maybe studies to assess insulin resistance because you won't pick this up as the simple plasma glucose test so what causes resistance let's start with muscle and the reason i like to start with muscle is when we study our young volunteers again i like them because they're perfectly healthy they're 20 years of age 19 to 20 they're lean because we know everyone who's overweight or obese probably has insulin resistance there's so many confounding factors that happen in overweight obesity these are lean 22 23 bmi lean non-smoking so we screen out smokers no medications no drugs and sedentary because we know people who exercise we can reverse insulin resistance and we can talk about how that happens so you give these young 20 year olds let's say screen we screen to this state probably a thousand but you get a distribution given a drink of glucose tolerance 75 grams you measure insulin and you can calculate insulin sensitivity index it's the crude index and it's kind of a bell-shaped curve and you have people in the bottom quartile who are insulin resistant by definition the top quartile then you ask why are those people in the bottom quartile insulin resistant and you measure glycogen synthesis using the methods we talked about briefly carbon nmr gives c1 glucose measure flux into glycogen and it's already down by 50 percent compared to the sensitive ones under matched insulin and glucose concentrations so they're resistant because they can't get glucose in the glycogen that's the major pathway it's not glucose to lactate not glucose oxidation so that's your pathway then you want to know where the block in that pathway is with phosphorus nmr we can measure glucose 6-phosphate inside the cell with a carbon nmr method we can measure glucose inside the muscle cell the reason this is important is we can see where the biochemical block is so your listeners all should probably you know get into a car and they're on the road and if there's construction going on we all know construction piles up after that whatever that roadblock is where the construction is happening the biochemistry is the same thing you have a roadblock and traffic builds up behind it so we measure g6p to argue you mentioned about three steps synthase hexokinase and transport glucose transport they had all been implicated to be the roadblock the step response for the insulin resistance and so we were able to sort out which was rate controlling by measuring these intermediates so if the block is at synthase glucose 6-phosphate should build up and glucose should build up to block as a hexokinase you should basically have lower g6p and a build up of glucose and if the block is at transport there should be reductions in both glucose 6-phosphate and glucose to a series of studies we found in not only these young lean insulin resistant offspring but obese insulin resistant individuals as well as individuals with poorly controlled diabetes g6p glucose 6-phosphate and glucose are both reduced in the muscle cell in vivo in humans implicating transport that's where your biochemical block is so the block is a transport that's your target to fix if you want to fix muscle insulin resistance and the the corollary is these other steps are not good targets drug targets to go after to fix insulin resistance and muscle this is the first abnormality we found in its transport and in these young healthy 20 year olds and then the question is what's wrong with the transport mechanism and that led us into the world of lipids again it's been known for decades that obesity associated with insulin resistance that's why virtually every obese adult or child have insulin resistance there are rare exceptions and then we basically found we developed a method measure fat inside the muscle cell and that was the best predictor for insulin resistance and muscle and this block and translocation let's give people a quick primer on normal glucose disposal into a cell so when the insulin molecule hits the insulin receptor on the surface i believe it auto phosphorylates itself correct that then signals to insulin receptor substrate one irs one inside the cell so that sends a signal inside the cell which also leads to a phosphorylation which then signals pi3 kinase it up regulates pi3 kinase and that basically leads to a glute4 transporter which you can think of as like a big tube being shoved up to the surface of the cell across its membrane and that basically passively allows glucose in it is not an active transporter correct that's correct everything you said is spot on basically up until now we don't know where the breakdown is in that whole process all we know is that something is impaired in getting glucose in the cell but in terms of is it there's not enough insulin that hits insulin receptor is there something wrong with irs1 with pi3k is there something blocking the transporter we're going to have to figure that out still but you've already taken two thirds of this puzzle off the plate by saying we know it's not downstream of that that's correct if you fix the transporter that's where the roadblock is and that's the target the next set of questions becomes why isn't insulin causing and as you point out this translocation of the group iv transporter to the membrane to allow glucose to come into the cell through facilitated transport down a gradient so that's what we can talk about next if you want to that's perfect can i share my screen with you at this point you can and what we will do jerry is we are going to take everything that you are sharing with me and we're going to turn these into show notes that will be time stamped to this part of the discussion because while i guess people like you and i do tend to picture these things in our head easily i think for many people it is going to be incredibly helpful to be able to actually look at some biochemical drawings i benefit from this greatly it's still not purely second nature to me i like to think in pictures too so as much as we can help the audience out with graphics i think it will be beneficial so here's a cartoon i'll walk you through this and stop me if you have questions this is a cartoon of a muscle cell we went through how insulin normally works insulin binds the receptor and everything as you said we're going to actually show this in this cartoon binds the receptor the receptor autophosphorylates becomes a kinase the key substrate for this kinase since receptor kinase in muscle's insulin receptors substrate1 which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation allows it to bind and activate this other protein pi3 kinase which lucantly discovered and that's a required step for translocation so that's all been worked out and somehow this is not working this is broken in the insulin resistant individual and again these young 20 year olds the patient with diabetes the obesity resistant individual and the question is what's wrong so i'm going to share with you at least my view which would explain insulin resistance in most situations of lipid-induced insulin resistance which i think accounts for i would say the majority of these patients i see who have type 2 diabetes or who obese and insulin resistance or even these young lean insulin resistant offspring and so this is the picture so here and it relates to fatty acid fat metabolism before i told you the other mr method that we developed is actually something called proton nmr and this is actually most of your listeners are very familiar with everyone knows about mri magnetic resonance imaging this is people go into a scanner and they get very pretty pictures of of an organ brain or some other organ for diagnostic reasons and it's the same biophysical principles you're basically getting this nmr signal from protons and protons are the most abundant nmr visible nucleus in the body and it's mostly water we're looking at so when you're basically getting the same signal from protons and mostly protons are water and fat and so an imager gives you this three-dimensional reconstruction of proton density in water and fat and that's what gives you the images and again we're doing biochemistry so we're getting taking that same kind of information but actually looking at individual carbon atoms or phosphorus atoms or in this case protons lining the carbons and triglycerides it's fat so what i said using proton nmr to measure fat inside the cell this is different from fat outside the cell so if you look at a steak and you see the marbling of fat in a steak that's fat outside the muscle cell which you don't see if you look at a steak is the fat inside the muscle cell and using nmr we can actually discern fat outside the cell versus fat inside the cell we can do this in many organs and muscle started in muscle and using this approach we found fat inside the muscle was the best predictor for this block and transport in all of our volunteers young people old people children sedentary individuals sedentary individuals fat inside the cells the best predictor for instant resistance and so this led us into the world of lipids we're keen to understand and then if finding the lipid intermediate that might do this and in studies where we took healthy individuals perfectly normal sensitivity we gave them an intra-lipid infusion just raised plasma fatty acids for three to four hours and found that after three to four hours we can make them as insulin resistant as anyone with type 2 diabetes and others had shown that in addition to us i mean this is we weren't the first to show this but what we were the first to show is it's due to this block in glycogen synthesis and it's the same block it's that block and transport just to be clear when you deliver intralipid that's intravenous lipid as a triacylglycerol or diacylglycerol no this is a triglyceride this is a emulsion a triglyceride emulsion it's often given to patients for hyper elementation when they can't eat you give this energy rich infusion just like tpn or something like that yeah and it's used in tpn often but what we also do is just a little low dose of heparin to activate lipoprotein lipase so all of a sudden then you can artificially raise fatty acids to fold something from you know up to about you know one and a half millimolar and ask the question what does this do what does this have to do with visit ultra metabolism and it has profound effects so by increasing lpl expression not expression activity i did not know that heparin activated lpl so by activating lpl with heparin cool trick to know i'll keep that in mind you're going to get more of that lipid into the muscle cell you will raise fatty so what the heparin does is it causes activation of lipoprotein lipase and that will then break down the triglycerides to raise fatty acids and more delivery fatty acids to all cells in the body yeah okay so this becomes basically a quick vehicle by which you can deliver lipid directly into the muscle cell exactly where you can acutely change that and again you can't do this just by giving fatty acids fatty acid turnover is so fast you can't just infuse fatty acids to significantly raise so this is a way we're able to raise fatty acids specifically in vivo in humans we do this in animals and it said so it's a nice pharmacological way of asking the question what impact does just simply raising fatty acids for a few hours have on metabolism and it's profound it takes three to four hours before you see this and then boom it's you get very profound insulin resistance and in our early studies again we showed using the same methods i told you about measuring glucose 6-phosphate measuring intracellular glucose measuring glycogen synthesis we found simply raising fatty acids for three to four hours blocks glycogen synthesis profound insulin resistance as i say as anyone with obesity or type 2 diabetes and it's due to the same an acquired block in transport insulin activation of transport both g6p and glucose are down so that to us was a very important lesson because it basically changed the paradigm because prior to this people workers biochemists you may know the name philip randall he did some pioneering studies in the 60s at university of bristol and was really the first to say hey fatty acids may be toxic may be causing insulin resistance and did studies in rat tissue you know cells heart tissue diaphragm muscles taken from rats in vitro incubated it with fatty acids and in vitro in the test tube induced insulin resistance the mechanism that they postulated was that it was altering basically oxidation the tca cycle citrate levels would build up and lead to inhibition of phosphofructokinase which is a key glycolytic enzyme the prediction that randall made was glucose 6-phosphate should increase leading to inhibition of hexokinase we were interested in that because we said oh fat in our hands is important we're raising fatty acids and causing resistance and we see this really strong relationship between fat in the muscle cell and insulin resistance in all of our subjects obese diabetic young insulin resistant individuals and so we wanted to see if his mechanism randall's postulated mechanism translates to humans because these were all in vitro studies done in tissues taken from animals so in a series of studies we took again the healthy individuals raised fatty acids through this triglyceride and little dose of heparin infusion and found just the opposite to what randall predicted they got insulin resistance which is what he would have said but not through his mechanism he said g6p should go up we saw it go down and we saw glucose go down so it wasn't through inhibition of glycolysis as he said it's somehow interfering with the insulin activation of transport so and again same rate controlling step we saw in all of our diabetics and obese individuals and pre-diabetic individuals but just to be clear jerry it caused hypoglycemia the intralipid dropped glucose no raising the fatty acids caused insulin resistance inability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport okay okay yep i may have misheard you but okay i'm gonna now fast forward we then took these observations back to the bench we're able to replicate this and rodents rats and mice and the power even though i'm most passionate about are human studies i'm a clinical physiologist and i care most about understanding what's happening in humans the animal models allow you to really interrogate biochemical process there we can get tissue out in humans i like to be non-invasive with our mr methodology but here sometimes you need to get tissues to measure activities phosphorylation events and and also you have the power of mouse genetics you can knock genes in and out of mice to really rigorously test hypothesis i should tell you one experiment before i move to this cartoon that we did in humans is we did biopsies in these humans when we raised fatty acids and found this block in transport and asked the question is a lipid intermediate a fatty acid metabolite interfering with insulin signaling cascade which we just discussed receptor and somewhere to pr3 kinase and what we found was indeed in healthy individuals just give glucose and insulin you get activation of pi3 kinase this is the step you mentioned this is the required step for translocation and in the follow-up study same individuals we raise glucose and insulin and also raise fatty acids and then we totally abrogate insulin activation of pathokinase that study basically in humans in the model we care about is saying yes somehow a fatty acid metabolite is leading to this block in insulin action somewhere between pi3 kinase and the receptor so we've narrowed it down to that i'll walk you through the steps that i think then are the biochemical metabolite that's mediating this the lipid fatty acid mediator that's leading to this and then the biochemical mechanism does that sound good yeah that sounds fantastic here we have a cartoon of a muscle cell and my view again thinking about flux it has to do with relative imbalance so basically doing focused lipidomics we zeroed in on this metabolite fatty acid metabolite called diacyl glycerol and yeah i heard you mentioned that before it's the precursors the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis diesel two fatty acids on a glycerol backbone this is a bioactive metabolites been known for years to activate novel pkcs this is what we found trapped in our animal models with lipid induced insulin resistance do high fat feeding in a mouse or rat get muscle in some resistance and it was this metabolite that trapped with insulin resistance and then we did the lipid same type of lipid infusion we did in humans simply raise plasma fatty acids by giving triglyceride and heparin we saw acyl coas go up we saw dags go up right when dags reached a peak then we got activation of novel pkcs pkc theta and epsilon in the muscle then we link to this block in insulin action which i'll show you in a second at the level of the receptor and one step downstream of the receptor the concept that i'd like to impart on you is it's this imbalance between fluxes so fatty acids are continuously being delivered to muscle cells and we're going to do the same thing if we have time to talk about the liver because that's the other key instant responsive organ but we'll start with muscle fatty acids are being delivered either through fatty acids or even hydrolysis of triglycerides through lpl endothelial delivering more fatty acids to the muscle cell when it's the flux of fatty acids into the muscle cell that exceeds the ability of the mitochondria to oxidize the fat or store this fatty acids acyl coast triglyceride you get net accumulation of dioxiglycerol this is a very important point triglycerides are neutral so i want to emphasize this so even though triglycerides often track with insulin resistance we've dissociated it inside the muscle cell and liver cell from insulin resistance it's a marker for dags typically tracts very well but it's an inert storage form of lipid so triglycerides are not the culprit we've dissociated in liver and muscle but it's a pretty good marker if you can't measure the dags with mass spec let's go back to that for a second i want to make sure people understand what we're saying here so a triacylglyceride or triglyceride those two we use interchangeably has this three carbon glycerol backbone with three free fatty acids on it that's the way that we very very efficiently store energy in the most energy dense hydrocarbon in our body the dag by extension has only two of those free fatty acids what typically sits on that third carbon and what is it about that conformation that renders the dag in this case at least seemingly much more of a problem than the tg or tag basically it's a hydroxyl group a simple hydroxyl group it's the two fatty acids of the dag that sit into the bilayer membrane bilayer and then the hydrophilic hydroxyl group sits in the cytoplasm and that's what then will pull the novel pkcs to the plasma membrane so that's the troublemaker that's the troublemaker basically then when you get this imbalance between fatty acid uptake versus oxidation in the mido versus storage is neutral lipid you get activation of these two novel pkcs in muscle theta and epsilon theta blocks insulin action at the level somewhere between the receptor and irs-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and epsilon and we'll get into this for the liver directly binds to the insulin receptor and then hits the receptor kinase if we have a chance i'd love to share this with you and your listeners because this i think has important evolutionary mechanisms behind it why does this exist and it's going to be very important for survival during starvation but nevertheless when both of these npkcs in muscle are activated you have reduced insulin tyrosine phosphorylation irs1 less pr through kinase activation and as we talked about then less food for translocation so to me the real culprit and we've been able to just quickly really test this rigorously gene knockout we've been able to inactivate isoforms npkc theta you get protection we've been able to block mito oxidation and you make these animals prone to that buildup insulin resistance we block fat entry into the myocyte inactivate fat4 they're protected you overexpress lipoprotein lipase in the muscle more fatty acid delivery muscle specific and some resistance and then finally if you rev up mitochondrial fat oxidation let's say through uncoupling overexpress ucp3 in the muscle you get protection from insulin resistance and all these track with dags going up or down with the insulin resistance or protection from insulin resistance let's talk a little bit about how we think this is different in an active versus inactive person because the outset you said look when we're trying to find this in the youngest cohort of patients these 20 year old basically undergrads at yale that we're going to study we screen on many things but an important thing we screen for is sedentary behavior you mentioned that at the very outset which leads me to believe that if you did a sampling across the cross-country team the crew team you wouldn't find this phenomenon so what is it about activity or the lack thereof that presumably points to this elevation of intracellular dags that kicks off this cascade let me just show you so this is where we talked about reeven and his hypothesis of insulin resistance and how what we wanted was to build on it because i'm going to answer your question about exercise and i want to do two things now i want to show you how exercise reverses this muscle and some resistance but i also want to show you and your listeners why exercise in muscle actually will prevent fatty liver and liver insulin resistance i think that this is a useful segue and so this is from jerry rubin's banting election in 1988 and at that time people were still arguing whether insulin resistance was driving all these other things we see around the circle atherosclerosis hypertension type 2 diabetes polycystic ovarian disease inflammation or are these just common things clustering together so what we wanted to do was actually ask the question what we see in these young 20 year olds these volunteers is the first thing we see is muscle insulin resistance and maybe that's driving atherogenic dyslipidemia it's going to lead to heart disease high triglycerides low hdl and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by changing the fate of ingested carbohydrate from glycogen to fat so this is the distribution as telling you about and healthy young sedentary individuals we're going to get into exercise in a second we simply take the bottom quartile one and four versus the top quartile and we give them two high carbohydrate meals and we say where's the energy going from that carbohydrate how is it being stored getting at the very first question you asked me we can use our nmr to measure changes in fat storage and liver and muscle as well as glycogen in liver and muscle and what we found then is you give them two high carbohydrate milkshakes and there's virtually no difference in the plasma glucose concentrations that at this late breakfast and lunchtime high carbohydrate shake but you can see it it's the expense of severe hyperinsulinemia is what we talked about so the reason these young insulin resistant as well as every insulin-resistant person is perfectly fine is the beta cells are pumping out two to three times the amount of insulin just to maintain you glycemia so these beta cells are just being whipped working really hard and that's why no one's diabetic you're insulin resistant that's why virtually every obesity resistant person is normal glycemia because the beta cells are working so hard to maintain this and you can see that here the other thing i want to point out is the insulin levels are i'll give a number you know so normal maybe a hundred at the peak and maybe 180 at the peak in the resistant individuals but this is in plasma the portal vein what the liver sees is three times the liver seen huge amounts of insulin in these insulin resistant individuals just to maintain normal glycemia we use carbon and tomorrow to look at changes in muscle glycogen and liver glycogen you can see again young insulin resistant 20 year olds can't get glucose into muscle glycogen due to a block in transport because they have increased ectopic fat in the myocyte dags are up no problem in liver and then you look at the changes in fat and this carbohydrate this is change in liver triglyceride it's up two and a half 2.3 fold you put some heavy water stable heavy water into the milkshake to track denver lipogenesis that's the conversion of glucose to fat and that's also up greater than twofold quick question there there was a very famous experiment it's been so long since i've read it i certainly know i spent many hours on it it was by mark hellerstein circa 94-ish and he looked at this question of how much carbohydrate could be converted to fat via de novo lipogenesis and if i recall correctly the answer was at least from that paper was not that much but also i believe one of the criticisms of that was that he was looking at an insulin sensitive population am i remembering that correctly because what you're showing here would suggest the opposite would suggest that an insulin resistant person is capable of significant de novo lipogenesis everything you've said is correct when you're thinking about denovo lipogenesis two things is again what conditions are you studying this is it after meal ingestion is it in the fasting state when a lot of people have measured this in the past it's minimal and it makes sense it only gears up with substrate is taking in and then depending on the type of substrate you can alter this quite a bit so it can be changed by simply putting more fructose more glucose in the meal by increasing the meal size mark's done beautiful work in the past it is what it is those studies are what they are but clearly what we're learning here is just as you say dnl is significant it's not the majority of the fat i think most investigators would agree the majority of fat synthesis in liver is occurring through esterification that is fatty acids coming to the liver getting corporate into triglyceride but there is a significant importance for dnl and again especially if you track it chronically in patients who are continuously high carb feeding especially high sucrose high fructose corn syrup we want to get into that but fructose basically gets funneled into the liver into the dnl pathway it's ubiquitous you can push dnl to be significant and it is a significant contributor to metabolic fatty liver disease and it's upregulated with peripheral sensitivity i think this is the major message i want to give here is when you have muscle insulin resistance specifically it will drive the liver fat synthesis by dnl when you have that when your liver is making more fat through dnl it makes more bldl exports so plasma triglycerides go up and hdl goes down so what i find interesting about this before you go further jerry is this is all from the 2007 p nas paper by your wife actually right kit peterson yeah kit peterson so what i find interesting about these data is that these patients were you glycemic i mean that to me is the staggering piece of this these patients are still potentially a decade away from seeing an interference in glucose homeostasis they're a decade away from their doctor saying hey your glucose is a little higher than it should be postprandially never mind even at the fast and yet they're already seeing an 80 increase in triglyceride which i just want to sort of talk a little bit about this clinically most laboratory assays will say a triglyceride level of 150 milligrams per deciliter is considered normal well we don't say that in our practice we view anything over a hundred as abnormal that's a red flag and if your trigs are more than 2x your hdl cholesterol that's a very big red flag although most people would accept triglycerides of three or four if not five times above hdl cholesterol before the sirens would go off and yet when you look at these patients again you glycemic you see a difference of approximately you know 100 to 105 of the trigs in the insulin resistant to 60 in the insulin sensitive so it's all kind of right here in front of you sort of in a way that unfortunately just doesn't get appreciated but it's the more intense stuff that's mind-boggling to me which is the two and threefold difference we see in de novo lipogenesis hepatic synthesis of fat impaired hepatic glucose sensitivity and i guess it speaks to the points you made earlier jerry which is when the portal vein amplification of insulin differences is as big as it is it becomes basically a magnifier of everything we're seeing in the periphery exactly yeah and our norman of data in my view we need to reset what we consider normally is to me this is when we look at their insulin sensitive that's what our normal should be and guiding us you asked about exercise that's something we're quite passionate about and i want to kind of see tell you how that fits in here so again conceptually here we have a normal person ingesting carbohydrate first question how is this distributed it's in glycogen is where you want to store your ingested carbohydrate it gets stored in glycogen and liver and muscle and again this is one quarter of our young lean healthy volunteers our insulin resistance and again if you're overweight or obese you're there already because these are lean individuals and that's still one quarter of the population you can't get that ingested glucose into glycogen due to this block in transport due to the block in dag pkc inhibition of insulin signaling it's diverted to liver you have that insulin in the portal vein that's three times peripherals up to five six hundred micro units per ml that turns on srb p1c the master transcriptional regulator of triglyceride synthesis gears up all the dnl enzymes so you have increased dnl that leads to this increase we just reviewed plasma triglycerides this reduction in hdl this is going to set these healthy individuals up to atherogenic dyslipidemia heart disease in their 40s and 50s with time it's metabolic associated fatty liver disease now and again most common cause of liver disease now in the world it's now leading cause of nash leading cause of liver fibrosis cirrhosis and staged liver disease and gonna be liver cancer so it's all gonna be metabolic driven and from that hyperinsulinemia in my view so exercise can we do anything about this this hypothesis is right we can test it and so you asked about exercise so this is a study we did some years ago published in the new england journal took these young insulin resistant offspring and this is with parents with type 2 diabetes and the jocelyn group did a really nice study they found that if you have two parents with type 2 diabetes and if you're insulin resistant that single parameter is the best predictor whether or not you would go on to develop type 2 diabetes so we've tried to study these individuals with our methodology extensively and john luca persagen who did this study when he was a fellow with me took these and just studied them in the basal state shown here that you know again in these young insulin resistant again everyone's here is lean not smoking no medications they're in their 20s and 30s bmi 23 24 to factor out obesity confounding the factors of obesity medication smoking other things so young lean healthy individuals but just parents with diabetes insulin resistant you study them and in the basal state take up less than half the amount of glucose in muscle and it's due to a block in transport so same thing as i've gone on and on before the diabetics and the obese individuals this block and transport and we asked the question does exercise can we bypass this abnormality and the answer is yes so here you can see this was after six weeks of being on a stairmaster three 15-minute bouts at about 65 percent mvo2 max and here we're normalizing insulin stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis and we usually measuring glucose 6-phosphate we've opened up that door of getting glucose into the myocyte so and i think molecular explanation for this is this protein called ampk which we can talk about gets activated with exercise and that has been shown to cause bohr translocation independent independent of piatria kinase and so we're kind of short-circuiting that block with exercise to test our overall hypothesis does muscle insulin resistance drive fatty liver and dnl and high triglycerides we took these young insulin resistant individuals and we showed john lucas showed in that new england journal study even a single bout 45 minute bout was sufficient to open up the door to glucose caused that glute for translocation and rasmus rubble when he was a clinical fellow with me did one single bowel in these same individuals i showed you before insulin resistance and muscle the ones had high triglycerides low hdl and prone to increase dnl with the single bout we able to show that that same ingested glucose would lead to more glucose deposition as muscle glycogen and we got significant reductions in denova lipogenesis significant reductions in liver triglyceride i just want to make sure i understand that and it's relevant to another question i have about the difference between insulin dependent and independent glucose uptake so do we know if that single bout of exercise which particular piece of the pathway got released did it have some direct effect on the root cause the dag or some of the kinases downstream was it even further downstream at the very last step where the transporter gets released like where is the actual bottleneck alleviated with that single bout of exercise i can speculate in these were human studies i can tell you that we open up the door we measure glucose 6-phosphate in them and and that goes up so we open the door for that defect and insulin stimulating transport is now reversed so glucose transporters are in the membrane glucose is coming in what i can tell you is whether or not we've altered dags and we're getting improved insulin signaling at the level of the receptor and irs1 and or is it just ampk causing this good for translocation if i had to speculate i would think most of it is through the latter we were simply with an acute bout causing an ampk induced glut4 translocation which we know happens independent of pediatric kinase that's established so we're short-circuiting we're just causing glute4 right at all the lower mechanisms to get to the membrane so we fixed the block in insulin action i think though with chronic exercise therapy we're going to be doing both where we get melt away the lipid and dags go down so we have improved insulin signal as well as more ampk induced before translocation yeah i'll tell you just i think i've even discussed this on a previous podcast i've had a couple of patients with type 1 diabetes that i've taken care of not many but in the phenotype of patients with type 1 diabetes where there is a significant amount of exercise specifically sort of modest intensity aerobic exercise so a person who is for example doing brisk walking very brisk walking sort of to the tune of four miles an hour an hour to two hours a day these patients with type 1 diabetes can be virtually free of insulin and maintain reasonable glycemic control so they can walk around with a hemoglobin a1c of 6 percent using maybe 12 units of insulin a day and obviously restricting carbohydrates but again it suggests i say this having watched them change the intensity duration of the exercise that it seems that that exercise becomes a spigot to how much glucose they can dispose in their muscle seemingly without insulin it's almost like a total bypass of the system which again i think to your point is chronic i don't think this is something we see acutely i obviously can't comment on it the first time i saw it which was probably about six years ago it really sent a light bulb off which is imagine now being able to maximize both insulin dependent and insulin independent glucose uptake into a muscle that really becomes a powerful tool to combat all this sort of metabolic dysregulation that's what amtk does is insulin dependent glucose uptake and i can see in combination with reduced carbohydrate consumption less coming into the circulation and whatever little comes in is taken care of through ampk insulin independent glut4 translocation so that fits before we go to the liver and i do want to actually talk about how all of this works in the liver i want to go back to one other thing that you very briefly touched on which is the evolutionary explanation for some of this that would be best done i might say with the liver okay great let's do it because i want to understand this yeah that's kind of fun so let's now turn so i kind of walked you through at least my thinking about insulin resistance why it's so important for not only diabetes but so many diseases i've shown you the physiological cause for insulin resistance in muscle can't get glucose into glycogen i've shown you that block is a transport and then i've given you a molecular understanding of how that insulin resistance in muscle happens my view is slip and dice of glycerol is blocked leading to activation of a novel protein kinase c epsilon theta blocking insulin signaling okay so let's now and then i've shown you how muscle insulin resistance can lead to fat accumulation in liver atherogenic disobedima and fatty liver now we know fatty liver is what then leads to insulin resistance in the liver and so i want to take you through the molecular basis for how fat and liver causes insulin resistance and it's pretty much what's nice now that you understand muscle lipid induced muscle resistance it's pretty close to the same story in liver so here's a cartoon of the liver cell but is the direction of causation jerry in the order in which you're telling the story in other words is the hyperinsulinemia as a result of muscle insulin resistance let me clarify that muscle insulin resistance which leads to peripheral hyperinsulinemia which is accompanied by portal vein hyperinsulinemia which leads to what you're about to tell us is that the order in which you think this occurs i do as i say this is what we see in our volunteers as we march through the progression in different stages we don't see liver abnormalities in these young 20 year olds it's all muscle and maybe a little bit of the fat cell which we'll come to at the end but it's the muscle there's no alterations in the liver until they get fatty liver once they get fatty liver then we see both insulin resistance in liver and insulin resistance and muscle a very important distinction between humans and rodents we've studied both models quite extensively rodents develop insulin resistance in the reverse direction they get liver fat first liver insulin resistance and then muscle most the studies on this are done in rodents is a very important distinction in terms of the progression and very different humans versus rodents and we can talk about similarities and differences if you want but we're going to focus mostly on humans for this talk and that makes total sense so it is again its peripheral ir hepatic ir hepatic consequences which then basically amplify it that's my belief yeah and again leading to this beta cell compensation compensation and then again something when you get both muscle liver insulin resistance and increased glucose production by liver and then something happens to the beta cell and that's when things really start to spiral where you have very profound hyperglycemia fasting a postprandial here's the cartoon of the liver cell and again glucose transport is not rate controlling as you know in the liver cell glucose just diffuses in through glut2 transporters and the insulin again binds the receptor same thing autophosphorylation the key intermediate there in liver is irs2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation use pi3 kinase just as you did in muscle akt2 and in liver what happens is you have a few things one not shown here is glucokinase translocation and that we've recently shown is probably very important for rate control getting glucose into the hepatocyte you also get activation of glycogen synthase and more glycogen synthesis and then you have this phosphorylation of foxo which is a transcriptional regulator and that then is excluded from the nucleus and then down regulates then gluconeogenesis through a transcriptional mechanism and if we have a chance i'd like to come back to this because we have some interesting data that speaks to really how insulin is inhibiting this key process so let's now just focus on how lipid causes insulin resistance in liver same metabolite it's the disoglycerols they go to activate epsilon that's really the major isoform of pkc novel pkcs and liver and work by varmin samuel when he was doing his phd with me in a series of studies varmin showed that epsilon binds to the insulin receptor and directly inhibits the receptor kinase itself and that then leads to downstream abnormalities what i want to share with you now which i think and again gets into this evolutionary basis for instance resistance which i think your listeners might find interesting is how is epsilon inhibiting the receptor kinase we worked on this jesse reinhardt and max peterson he was an md phd student with me we did untargeted phosphoproteomics and what i'm showing here is the catalytic domain of the insulin receptor yeah i can just describe it for the listeners it's a loop you can picture it as a door over the pocket for the catalytic domain of the insulin receptor and this door is closed iris one irs2 can't go into the pocket for tyrosine phosphorylation when insulin binds the receptor these three tyrosines the 1158 the 1162 and the 1163 become phosphorylated that opens the door that loop flips out and then irs wants to go into the pocket and undergo tyrosine phosphorylation to get the rest of the cascade going using untargeted phosphoproteomics we were able to show jesse reinhardt who is our collaborator in mass spec maven identified using purified receptor purified pkc epsilon that when you add activated epsilon to the receptor you phosphorylate this threonine and that got us very excited because kali that's one amino acid away from these two tyrosines that are required for activation receptors may be doing something important and so the other thing that got us excited about and here's getting into evolution is the sequence of the catalytic domain for the receptor and it's been conserved all the way from humans down to fruit flies those three tyrosines same position and that threonine that sits right between the two tyrosines 1158-1162 has been conserved all the way again from homo sapiens down to drosophila through evolution if something is important that usually hangs around that's a long time so to prove this we very simply we did some genetics again that's what you can do is you can knock a glutamic acid replace that threonine with glutamic acid mimic a phosphorylation event and that kills the kinase activity you can mutate the threonine twin alanine so it can't get phosphorylated and then you have protection in vitro from epsilon induced reduction and irk activity and then you can make the mouse and so here in this paper we made mice where we replaced the threonine in that key position the 11 this is the mouse homolog the 1150 is the homolog for the 11 16 humans so all the threonines are instead alanines and i won't get into the data and say the mice are perfectly normal normal chow normal insulin sensitivity nothing near normal size normal growth but when max fed these mice a high fat diet the wild type mice get profound hepatic insulin resistance and this we see and everyone else on the planet sees you feed mice high fat diet even for three days they get fat accumulation dag accumulation of panic insulin resistance does it have to have sucrose in it as well or just fat it doesn't need to be you can make it worse if you add a little sucrose they like that in the drinking water and they have even more fatty liver if you put sucrose in the drinking water but this is just with fat alone but it's even more greater when you put sucrose or fructose or whatever sugar you want in the drinking water and here then you can see when you simply mutate that three nutrient alone now you have perfectly normal hepatic insulin sensitivity as reflected by insulin's ability to suppress hepatic glucose production and this is despite the same amount of liver fat same amount of liver dags in the liver this tells us that that single amino acid is doing something very important in terms of mediating lipid induced insulin resistance and this actually just came out this last week this paper now just to summarize where we've now shown that there's different isoforms we didn't get into this into the of diazo glycerol and it really matters which isoform it is and what compartment it is just to summarize this paper that just came out in cell metabolism we were able to show by measuring the three different stereoisomers of diazoglycerols it's really the sn12 isoform and measuring these different isoforms in five different intracellular compartments the plasma membrane the cytosol lipid droplet er and the mitochondria it's really specifically the sn12 isoform in the plasma membrane that's important if you just measure total dags you may easily miss this we learned that this recent study and that we we showed both that pkc epsilon is both necessary and sufficient for this process by doing the knock-in and over-expression but i just want to basically touch on the question you asked me about why do we have insulin resistance why should it exist and the reason i think it exists is it's protective for us during starvation when you starve this is true pretty much in all mammals mice rats and humans when we starve we get fatty liver here in this study this is rachel perry's paper in cell from a couple years ago take rats just starve them for 48 hours you have increased lipolysis more fatty acids delivered to the liver hepatic fat accumulation dags we show go up sn12 pkc epsilon translocation and insulin resistance in liver and the main thing that insulin does in the liver is it promotes glucose uptake and storage is glycogen when you think about it that's what you want turned off during starvation because during starvation glucose is a very precious molecule and you want to preserve this in circulation for the cns which is critically in need it's really the major source of energy for the cns and so by promoting hepatic insulin resistance we're promoting glucose in circulation for basically the cns to operate and so that to me is why that threonine is preserved all the way from humans to fruit flies and i just wanted to show you this cover of nature this mexican cave fish it's a fun story because after our paper came out this little fish made the cover of nature and what was so fascinating about it is so these little fish they live inside caves they spend most of their life starving the only time they are able to eat is when something smaller than them swims in front of the cave and then they can reach out and grab it and pull it back into the cave and gobble it up and these workers who studied this mexican cave fish found this cavefish had a mutation in the insulin receptor had profound hepatic insulin resistance and they also went on to say this was important to allow them to survive in my view insulin resistance was a protective mechanism throughout evolution that allowed us to survive all species during starvation which was probably the predominant environmental exposure we've had for the last many many millennia and it's only in recent years recent decades that now we're in this toxic environment of over nutrition and it's when these same pathways now are going the opposite direction promoting disease by doing what they were at one time was protective and now they're actually being told metabolic disease that we just discussed so i want to make sure i can unpack this a little bit so i want to start in the muscle because i think it's easier and again we'll even talk about it in humans which means we can do it on a sort of different time scale because obviously 48 hours of fasting in a mouse is a seismic fast a near fatal fast but let's say 48 to 72 hours of fasting in a human we still would expect to see significant muscle insulin resistance and there would be a great reason for that evolutionarily because you would want to make sure that as much glucose as possible in that circulation which by this point is all coming through hepatic glucose output is not being quote unquote wasted in muscle glycogen synthesis to your point every gram of gluconeogenic substrate that's going through the liver and then coming out the liver should be preserved for the brain because even cahill's studies showed that after 40 days of starvation humans were still getting about 40 percent of cns energy from glucose the remainder from ketones so glucose never went away as a substrate for the brain so i think i have a handle on the muscle side of things i'm still struggling a little bit to understand the physiologic consequence of hepatic insulin resistance and how that feeds into what i think should be an environment that says figure out a way to make as much glucose for the cns as possible why does more fat accumulation in the liver make it better served to protect the brain so first of all let me step back so both organs during starvation both liver even though i focus here on liver muscle will become insulin resistant also through increased circulating fatty acids through the mechanisms we talked about dags building up pkc theta so insulin resistance in all organs are going to preserve glucose for the cns i was just focusing on the threonine here in liver because that's where epsilon was taking us to understand the liver i want to just take you to another cartoon because you're asking a very important question about processes about regulation how insulin works in liver and i think to do this let me just step back the conceptual view again this is a cartoon i always like to show how does insulin work this was from 20 years ago when i was first studying it maybe 30 years ago insulin binds to receptor magic happens something happens then you have an effects and so even though insulin's been since its discovery we're still trying to really understand what's happening in different tissues how it works and getting surprises so this is the canonical view we just went through of how insulin works on liver it binds the receptor it activates the cascade to promote glycogen synthesis and turn off gluconeogenesis and what we're finding is the simple view doesn't explain many things and i think needs modification especially in terms of insulin regulating gluconeogenesis this process that is required to keep us alive during starvation without gluconeogenesis we're not going to wake up in the morning because it's gluconeogenesis that supplies glucose for the cns while we're sleeping and certainly during starvation without this process we're in trouble i don't think that can be overstated by the way let's go back to what you just said we couldn't survive by my calculation jerry we'd have a hard time surviving 10 minutes without gluconeogenesis as a species well i'll modify that a little bit as passionate i'd love to hear you state the importance of gluconeogenesis no we know clinically you can't and again from the lessons learned from gene knockout you know unfortunately there are patients with inherited disease mongerkey's disease as you know patients who don't have glucose 6-phosphatase the last key step getting glucose 6-phosphate out we do know that can be compatible with life we have patients with glucose 6-phosphatase and the way we keep them alive is just continuously to feed them yeah that's my point without continuous glucose feeding your lifespan would be measured in minutes to hours without gluconeogenesis to regulate glucose homeostasis it's critical for life function we're on the same page so let's just talk about then how it's thought to operate and regulate it it's also important to be able to modulate it so we eat a meal we have to suppress gluconeogenesis otherwise glucose would go up to four or five hundred after eating a carbohydrate meal so it has to be a process that's turned on turn off and that turned on too much you know in terms of diabetes because that's what drives fats in hyperglycemia traditionally pretty much the major textbooks physiology biochemistry insulin is thought to be turn off gluconeogenesis through transcriptional mechanisms and again this is the spoxo phosphorylation by akt exclusion from the nucleus then you get down regulation of pepsi cake excuse me and six phosphatase foxo is the transcription regulator for these down regulation the problem with this view and again there's some beautiful molecular biology and i'm not going to want to deny this doesn't happen but the problem with this being the predominant regulating mechanism is threefold one is you can knock out akt or foxo and give insulin to the mouse and you can still turn off gluconeogenesis in a fasted mouse which is totally dependent on gluconeogenesis that speaks to the fact you don't need these key insulin signaling pathways to regulate gluconeogenesis the second thing in terms of its role in mediating fasting hyperglycemia and diabetes is we got liver from patients with poorly controlled diabetes so when patients go in for a roux and y or bariatric surgery the surgeon you can take a little piece of liver under direct visualization so it's very safe and give us enough liver we can do actually protein measurements and enzyme measurements of pepsi case six possibilities not just message but actually the proteins themselves and to my surprise i thought all these enzymes from everything i was thinking about biochemistry and at least what i learned and when i was luxury medical students i expected pepsi k and 6 phosphatase and fructose 1 6 by phosphatase all to be up regulated two to three fold in the poorly controlled diabetic that was undergoing ruined by past surgery compared to the non-diabetic and we found no relationship between protein expression of these enzymes gluconeogenic enzymes and at least fasting glucose and insulin and history of diabetes finally when you develop methods the flux methods we won't get into to actually quantify this flux of gluconeogenesis which has not been easy to measure by the way but we have methods now they're very good to measure this flux we can turn off gluconeogenesis within five minutes and that's much faster than you'd expect from transcriptional translational mechanisms just to kind of talk about how gluconeogenesis this is the gluconeogenic pathway lactate to glucose you can have transcriptional regulation you can have substrate regulation so glycerol we've shown from lipolysis there is no rate control the more glycerol that comes from fat breakdown in the fat cell that fluxes the liver comes right out as glucose there's no rate control just all substrate driven redox we've shown in the liver cell regulates gluconeogenesis and this in a series of studies that anila has done that's how i think metformin works and we can talk about that if you're interested but finally i want to emphasize is this allosteric regulation of gluconeogenesis by acetyl-coa this had been known for decades to be a regulator of pyruvate carboxylase and had kind of been forgotten because it was very hard to measure and no one looked at it in vivo because it's hard to measure in vivo or especially in the diabetic situation we said well wait a minute let's go back and look at acetyl-coa we developed the methods tandem aspect methods very sensitive very specific to do this in freeze clamp tissues from animals with varying degrees of diabetes hyperglycemia the bottom line is found a very robust relationship between acetyl-coa which is as you know the end product of beta oxidation take fatty acids and break them down through beta oxidation the end product is before it enters the tca cycle and there's this very robust relationship just all these different studies but basically every study we do we give insulin we get suppression of acetyl-coa this explains how insulin acutely suppresses gluconeogenesis when diabetic models when you have increased gluconeogenesis it's twofold increases in acetyl-coa but it perfectly follows rates of gluconeogenesis which we quantify track perfectly with concentrations of hepatic-acetyl content i just want to take you how insulin normally works in the liver cell and then how it becomes dysregulated in diabetes and this is going to answer your question about how do we distinguish insulin promoting storage is glycogen yet keeping gluconeogenesis going for the brain so this is very important to answer that question so in my view insulin binds the receptor and it has direct effects through the receptor that is mostly to promote glucose uptake and storage is glycogen the effects on gluconeogenesis the process that keeps us going during starvation is really mostly regulated not through the receptor in liver but it's through its effect on the fat cell in the periphery in studies we've done in awake rats and we're translating this to humans it's really insulin putting the break on peripheral lipolysis less fatty acid delivery to liver less generation of acetylcholine we've shown this the more fatty acids that flux the liver tract almost perfectly with acetyl-coa content less pyruvate carboxylase activity and again there's about 10 15 percent of this gluconeogenesis is simply coming from less glycerol from lipolysis to liver through substrate push so you have two very different processes here one is glycogen synthesis that's what the receptor is doing in liver gluconeogenesis is mostly 90 percent i would say there may be a little bit of intrapatic lipolysis regulation but mostly through its effect to put the brake on peripheral hypothesis and this model by the way will explain in my view the explanation for all the controversies of insulin action that have been described through the last decades in mice where you knock out akt in the mouse insulin still works you do things to the periphery fat cell and you affect glucose metabolism gluconeogenesis all these studies that appear to be conflicting can be explained if you use this model as a template to understand insulin action and again i have short-term fast and long-term fast this is important species differentiation mice and as you pointed this out peter even after an overnight fast boom all the glycogen is gone very different from humans humans hold on to their glycogen like dogs probably for two days we've done these measurements with starvation in humans we've shown that it takes about two days to deplete liver glycogen when you have glycogen in liver it's really these direct effects of insulin on liver will predominate but as you move to the fasting state so in the mouse after a 12 hour fast or longer and in a human have to go 24 or longer fast then it's really insulin these indirect effects will predominate and this will also explain all the controversies and dogs sharington bergman in terms of direct indirect they've each published a dozen papers on going back and forth which predominates this mechanism would explain i believe all of those findings and then i just want to now show you how i view the dysregulation and diabetes so now typically on the background of obesity which is what happens in most of our diabetics so you have lean individuals who also have this you have expanded fat stores in the periphery but now you have insulin resistance in the fat so insulin can't put the brake on lipolysis and we can talk about that mechanism which we're now working on but it's going to be very similar in terms of liver and muscle but you also have this component of inflammation has been described by many many individuals you get crown like structures macrophages move in they release alpha il-6 and what we were able to discern a lot of people would argue it was inflammation if you go back to the insulin resistance literature 10 20 years ago everyone was discussing inflammation circulating cytokines 10f alpha 6 resistant rbp circulating factors that were released from inflammation driving insulin resistance what we found is again you can dissociate inflammation from insulin resistance that's what i spent the first three decades of my life doing showing that just ectopic lipid dags would drive insulin resistance independent of inflammation but the transition from just insulin resistance in liver and muscle to fasting hyperglycemia depends on inflammation and it's through this mechanism where now you have localized inflammation in the fat cell tnf alpha il-6 i'm sure there's other things will promote increased lipolysis in the fat cell more lipolysis more fatty acid delivery to liver dags go up epsilon gets activated you block insulin action so less glucose being taken up into glycogen this is what happens in virtually most patients with fatty liver disease but again what takes you to fasting hyperglycemia is this and that's where acetyl-coa goes up and again now your rates of lipolysis when you measure turnover not just fatty acid concentrations but turnover palmitate turnover production and glycerol turnover it's up two-fold this increases acetyl-coa concentrations two-fold this activates pyruvate carboxylates activity and flux two-fold and then in addition your glycerol delivery to liver is up two-fold and now your rates of gluconeogenesis are increased two-fold and this is now what's driving fasting hypoglycemia in every poorly controlled type 2 diabetes it's this gluconeogenic process that we've shown using many many methods and others have shown this too this is what now is driving hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetics okay i have several questions jerry first these adipose sites that are undergoing lipolysis these are peripheral adipocytes is that correct yes you can have situations where even fat in the liver is probably contributing to this especially in the lipodystrophic individual has no peripheral fat cells so that under conditions the liver fat is playing a role but most of it in most of you know i would say garden variety what i see that is going to be peripheral lipolysis so when we think about an insulin resistant obese person with metabolic syndrome so this is what 20 of the u.s population maybe even more we've clearly established they are insulin resistant in the muscle we've established that they are insulin resistant in the hepatocyte they are obese so would we still say they are insulin resistant at the fat cell or would we say they are insulin sensitive at the fat cell because they are correctly undergoing lipogenesis in the fat cell they're at least taking up esterified fat and they're presumably impairing lipolysis which is why they retain adipocel mass in other words there's a the flux through the fat cell is negative they're holding on to fat correct yeah but i think and this is a question a very important question we're going to next i would still predict if you do careful studies of measuring rates of lipolysis by definition they will have insulin resistance in the fat cell and that's because the reason they're doing everything you just said they're holding on to fat they're not happy about the doctor's not happy about it is because it's at hyperinsulinemia so their insulin concentrations are two to three fold so again their curve is right shifted insulin is doing the thing but if you brought them down to normal levels of insulin then you might see more lipolysis and i think so i think if you were to do those studies and they've been done there is peripheral insulin resistance but then you superimpose in addition and i'll just say i'll share with your listeners we're finding actually the same mechanism that we have in liver and muscle and we're seeing this in many other tissues too in the fat cell the diaglycerol epsilon pathway is also accounting for this defect and insulin action in the fat cell so it's going to actually be a common mediator and again most the fat of course in the fat cells in the lipid droplet so again the plasma membrane disoglycerols that lead depths lawn activation in the membrane of the fat cells and we're seeing the same thing and we see those same ice that i showed you before the irk nakamites are protected from lipid induced fat insulin resistance on the fat topic we've talked a lot about the intra myocellular lipid you've distinguished it from say marbling or fat between cells one thing we haven't spoken about that clinically gets a lot of attention is visceral fat so you alluded to doing an mri so we do a t1 weighted image of a person on an mri gives us a beautiful resolution anatomically of what's happening and you can see the difference between a healthy person and an unhealthy person and one of the most glaring differences between people on that type of proton imaging is the amount of fat that is inside the fascia so you have subcutaneous fat that may not be aesthetically pleasing but more importantly when you go inside the corset of fascia you have some people that will have a heavy ring of fat around their kidneys their spleen their liver we call this visceral fat and the association between this amount of visceral fat and poor health is very well understood whereas there seems to be very little association between subcutaneous fat and poor health how does that visceral fat identification square with the intra lipid myocellular component that you've described so elegantly at a cellular level in my view and everything you said is correct subcu if you're going to store fat somewhere that's the best place to store it you certainly don't want to keep it inside liver and muscle cells in my view and again studies have been done to look at the visceral fat and it's very clear it is again a very apple shaped people have visceral fats a very good predictor of insulin resistance it's really more of a marker for intrapatic fat so any time when you're doing your imaging if you just look at the liver too they're going to correlate one to one 99 out of 100 times so what you're really doing there is a marker now it's the visceral fat will also pour fatty acids into the portal vein presumably and again fatty acid delivery portal veins probably going to lead to increased acetyl-coa you know again will contribute some degree to me the major abnormality is really the fat inside the parasite more importantly this acetyl-coa within the hepatocyte i want to give one example that makes this point clearly at least to me the lesson i learned and that's lipodystrophy and as you know that's the situation where there is no fat no sub-q fat or visceral fat these patients have no visceral fat huge livers hepatomegaly chock full of fat and liver and again diabetes through these mechanisms acetyl-coa driving gluconeogenesis and that's independent of visceral fat so that shows you you don't need the visceral fat at all to drive this it's that in the hepatocyte if i depict two molecules that are driving metabolic disease it's acetyl coa driving perfect carboxylase and again the dioglycerol is activating epsilon and again it's the epsilon that drives insulin resistance no diabetes no hyperglycemia then it's this accelerated gluconeogenesis through this mechanism that's taking you from just pure insulin resistance to fast and hypoglycemia and diabetes so let's again pause there for a moment and unpack something very profound if we've just established that the accumulation of liver fat is effectively the hallmark of death to come and you just said acetyl coa and dags are two of the biggest culprits well acetyl-coa of course is abundance of nutrient on some level which speaks to something you said earlier you take a patient with type 2 diabetes put them on 1200 calories a day by definition that has to lower acetyl coa that immediately is going to improve things which it does whether that's sustainable and definitely we can discuss and of course we've already established where these dags are coming from again i want to pause for a moment on that because i think a listener of this right now is going to say guys you've lost me okay they don't know the difference between pep k gsk3 akt2 pi3 kinase i don't think you have to know those things i think what you have to understand is that abundance of nutrient is a relative term it's not an absolute term an athlete versus a sedentary person has a very different amount of what that abundance looks like i think we've also discussed that not all nutrients are created equal you've alluded to it already that sucrose and fructose disproportionately primed the liver for this and then of course we're dealing with carbohydrate metabolism this is perhaps an interesting time to also start talking about both the modifications that we can make because again when we start to think about you've talked about western diet and sedentary behavior a lot so there's no doubt that there isn't our environmental triggers contributing to these epidemics which largely began here in the united states but we have fabulously spread to the west of the world and then of course there's a whole pharmacologic side of this i would like to revisit the metformin question i think it's a very interesting question metformin works presumably by sort of weakly poisoning the mitochondria at complex one that would lead to a redox change of nad and nadh which goes back to something you talked about but as of this time at least we don't really have many exciting compounds in the pipeline for nafld which as you also alluded to in about 10 years is going to through nash and cirrhosis be the leading indication for liver transplant in the united states something that when i was in medical school accounted for less than two percent of liver transplants just 20 years ago in 30 years admittedly with the advent of a cure for hep c it's now leapfrogged into the lead candidate for a liver transplant and yet what are we doing for it not a lot that's a lot i want to unpack and as much as you still have time to discuss it let's proceed in any order you see fit to add on to that i just did a zoom conference for university of pittsburgh and they're a big liver center and one of their big problems with transplanting livers is living donors they're limited by donors because they all have fatty liver which they will not transplant because they don't do well so not only is it the problem in treating it in terms of at least this most commonly that's the most common thing that they do but that's an aside so what can we do about this if we can get our patients to lose weight this of course is the best diet and exercise of course is the best thing and that's the first thing i tell my patient and we really drill into them how we can really fix everything that's wrong with them through this process and unfortunately as you know and i know it just doesn't work in the vast majority of our patients so in terms of pharmacology my view and here again it's the liver if i had to pick one organ to target it's the liver as important as muscle insulin resistance is at the very beginning if we actually want to reverse the disease and make the biggest impact if i had to pick one or it's the liver if you're going to target probably the easiest organ to target the way i think about the liver is in terms of thermodynamics it's a thermodynamic problem it goes back to my physics training and it's really energy in and energy out the whole metabolic problem with the liver is this imbalance of energy too much energy in relative to the ability of the hepatocyte the liver to oxidize the energy and convert it to co2 or export it the one thing the liver is also able to do is export energy is the form of the ldl triglyceride if it's energy how do we fix it well one way again we said diet and exercise limit energy and that works and that we talked about kit peterson did this 20 years ago and it's shown many many times to get the patient to stay on this is challenging bariatric surgery works again limiting energy in we just saw a nice study in the new england journal there's no magic to ruin why it's simply if you pair feed individuals lose same amount of weight same effect everything the bariatric surgery is doing at least four and y is really through reducing through the weight loss how can we do this pharmacologically well glp-1 agonists are out there now they're becoming very popular their major effect is energy intake our patients eat less because they less they lose weight induces nausea mild nausea some people get into issues with vomiting nausea mom you have to cut back on the dose but this is how the glp-1 agonists i believe are having its major effect is weight loss and they are what they are they do accomplish reversal fatty liver to some degree they don't normalize but it does come down in the right direction why do you think the glp-1 agonists lead to reduced appetite i just think through working through a central mechanism all these gut peptides lead to nausea vomiting glucagon will do its statin will do all these things if you give them a high enough concentrations lead to some degree of nausea and vomiting to me it's part of a spectrum and if you just get it right you just get people less interested in food and they eat less metformin that's the one agent we have that lowers gluconeogenesis i would just come back it's not complex one i want to challenge you on that we can talk about that but to me it's complex one inhibition happens at millimolar concentrations and clinically not relevant our concentrations of metformin in humans metformin are about 50 micromolar 40 to 50 micromolar not millimolars which is what inhibits complex one and i think it's downstream it does affect the mitochondria does lead to the redox but it's not through the complex one it's probably indirectly inhibiting mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase that's what leads to the redox but we can come back to that if you want i'd love to that's very interesting to focus then on other mechanisms so glp1 limit food intake energy expenditure sglt2 inhibitors cause glucose loss in the urine 400 calories a day loss so they lose weight unfortunately it seems to plateau after several weeks and you get very mild reductions in liver fat unfortunately not as much but maybe in combination with other things that might be certainly helping the right direction my favorite target is to promote mitochondrion efficiency and so one of the things we're working on now is the mitochondria is where you burn the fat that's the organelle that burns the fat through oxidation if you can promote then the mitochondria be a little bit less efficient so they have to burn more fat to generate the same amount of atp this we've shown in various forms preclinical models mice rats with fatty liver nash liver fibrosis it reverses fatty liver through these mechanisms reverses nash reverses the insulin resistance through reductions in dags acetyl-coa reverses diabetes and zdf models for the nash world it reverses the inflammation and liver will reverse liver fibrosis and so i'm very excited about this because i think it can be done safely more recently we've done this in non-human primates and showed safety and efficacy of this approach in non-human primates so based on the mechanisms i've described i think it fits and not only what i'm very gratified by is it actually reinforces the mechanisms i've described here by reversing diabetes insulin resistance by lowering dags and acetyl coa but it's also going to be heart healthy and i want to emphasize this point because many drugs we have now for nafl and ash reduce liver fat maybe reverse the fibrosis or slow down the fibrosis but they may lead to alterations of cholesterol in the wrong direction cholesterol goes up and again i have to come back to a nice point you made is it's heart disease that is killing not only our diabetic but also fatty liver patients it's the heart disease so whatever we're doing to reverse fix nafl nash liver fibrosis it has to be heart healthy and so when you burn fat in liver through this mechanism you decrease the ldl export you lower triglycerides you raise hdl and you actually have secondary beneficial effects on the periphery so you actually will secondarily improve muscle fat reduce muscle fat muscle resistance so this again fits into my conceptual view of insulin resistance and would be i think a nice therapeutic approach that we're going after now does the uncoupling lead to excess ross creation or anything else anytime i hear of uncoupling in the mitochondria which is a deliberately induced form of inefficiency you wonder is this an unintended consequence potentially so uncoupling by definition the biophysics of uncoupling the energy has to go somewhere it's dissipated as heat you're burning more fat and changes in the energy is going to lead to a little bit of heat production you will get energy production in the form of heat but because it's liver targeted has no effect on body temperature will not affect whole body weight it's interesting i can just tell the story about couplers your lecturers might be interested in this so they were first discovered actually in the early 1900s in the munitions factories europe was getting ready they knew a world war was coming the munition factories were all getting geared up some of the workers in the munition factories were getting this dust yellow dust on their hands and actually losing weight they were just going home and despite eating the usual amount they're finding their weight was going down and maybe they were sweating a little bit more a little diaphoresis they went to their doctors and told them about the weight loss despite eating the same and a little bit more diaphorese more sweating and the doctors just said what is this yellow dust on your skin and why don't you just wear gloves wash your hands and wear gloves and they got better this was dinitrophenol this was a substance that was used in the munition factories to make tnt so dinitro tnt a physician tainter in the 1930s basically said maybe this is good for weight loss actually introduced dinitrophenol as a weight loss drug it was available over the counter it wasn't a prescription so anyone could go like buying vitamins get some dnp for weight loss it actually worked so a lot of people hundreds of thousands of people took dinitropheno for weight loss and it worked the papers published in very good journals jama by tainter and others really described its beneficial effects unfortunately and a very big unfortunately is again one of the on target effects we just talked about when you uncouple you promote heat generation and this is in the whole body dnp is going everywhere and promoting heat generation unfortunately a handful of these people took too much they got into problems with hyperthermia increased body temperature and got very sick from that and some died with the very first thing a newly created fda 1937 the first act they did was actually to pull dnp from the counters as an over-the-counter kind of drug or medication and the second act they had actually was thalidomide which they pulled and now is actually back in the clinic that was always the problem with dnp why again we say this is not a good thing this is a toxic drug and everything else and as it is it occurred to us that the reason it's generating the heat is you're uncoupling all the organs in the body and what if we just picked one organ i.e the liver where the fat is accumulating this is where the organ that's driving lipidemia hyperlipidemia and diabetes and if we could just melt the fat away within a liver specific manner maybe we can have that beneficial effect without the toxicity and so in a series of studies we were able to show proof of concept that by simply uncoupling the liver you could avoid hyperthermia and all the toxicities that have typically been associated with the parent compound dnp and increase the therapeutic window every drug has a therapeutic window even aspirin and tylenol by a hundred fold based on this thinking i think it can be done very safely and be a treatment for very important metabolic diseases like nafl and nash so the ind has already been filed for this is it in phase one human yet no no we're still exploring pre-clinical models thinking potentially about first starting out where there are no indications for things like lipodystrophy where leptin's not working so i think my thinking is i'd like to go slowly here hopefully within the next year or two we may be in humans i think initially going after orphan diseases where there simply is no other treatment and that would be certain forms of lipodystrophy where they get very bad diabetes nafl nash and especially in conditions where leptin's not working jerry this has been obviously as i said a pretty technical discussion even by the standards of our podcast i think the show notes are going to be integral because your figures i think frankly are very helpful as i said i understand this content probably better than most and yet i still find it very helpful to be able to kind of go through schematics so i'm going to encourage the listeners to do that you also have some fantastic lectures online i think for the people who really want to go deep into this stuff i think frankly some of your review articles and some of your recent publications are just a great place to go as i said at the outset i just think that this is the nexus from which all diseases stand and therefore we are really making a mistake if we want to treat chronic diseases in their silos and just think about atherosclerosis and just think about cancer and just think about alzheimer's disease without understanding how these diseases are fed and unfortunately that means rolling up our sleeves and understanding insulin resistance there's simply no getting around this if this topic were easy you would have presented it in an easier manner it's not easy if i were to just kind of leave you with sort of we've talked about exercise we've talked about nutrition do you feel strongly about any form of dietary thinking so for example i have found clinically that carbohydrate restriction is a very effective way for patients with insulin resistance to lose weight not uniformly but it's quite effective it also seems to be easier to adhere to than outright caloric restriction though periodic fasting also seems to do a good job but have you observed anything similarly from a clinical perspective that fructose restriction specifically or sugar restriction specifically as a vehicle to weight loss becomes a more effective tool to ultimately produce what's understood to be efficacious just some reduction of weight either as the cause or effect of the improvement my thinking here is what i tell my patients is whatever works to everyone is so different different likes different dislikes i say look at the scale whatever works for you to lose weight because i know if you lose the weight your diabetes is going to get better so i say you find something whatever works for you stick with it that's the challenge because we're very successful in the short term getting patients to lose weight the unfortunate part is they're able to get the weight off and then three months later six months later they come back to the office and they're right back where they started so it's a matter of i tell them you have to find something that works for you get the weight off but then you have to be able to stick to it and that's where the challenge a lot of diets people are able to get on and get the weight off and they just can't adhere to it for the long term and so it's a marathon you have to find something you like like it enough to be able to stick with that's the most important thing because we've all seen that where people lose the weight and then a few weeks months later right back to where they started so everyone has to find what works for them i guess i want to come back to the metformin thing because it's so interesting so you mentioned that the inhibition of complex one actually is probably not taking place because you actually mentioned basically a thousand-fold difference in concentration say a little bit more about that and why you're then imputing that it's the impact of metformin presumably on nad and nadh which you could also get out of an inhibition of complex one but via some other mechanism it sounds like studies that we've done and we're still working on this clearly most the literature if you read on metformin let's talk about the big picture so metformin lowers glucose in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mostly through inhibition of gluconeogenesis i think most clinical physiologists would agree with that and so we've done studies quantifying gluconeogenesis both by nmr heavy water multiple methods same individuals and that's its major effect not through inhibition of glycogenolysis not through gut biome it's gluconeogenesis and the other thing clinically is the more poorly controlled diabetes the greater the effect you're not going to see much effect there's very confusing studies that have been published in non-diabetic individuals that find all kinds of other things going on i don't think that's clinically relevant it's gluconeogenesis so then how does it do gluconeogenesis so most the literature if you read it virtually all in animals that study mechanism have implicated complex one and we've known about guanide inhibition metformin is a guanide by guanide even before metformin with phenformin and other guanids that have been studied and they will inhibit complex one no doubt about it so and most have focused on complex one inhibition leading to either ampk activation or buildup of a metabolite that inhibits gluconeogenesis or something 99 of the mechanisms have talked about complex one inhibition my issue with that is again not very many studies have done careful measurements of this most commonly used drug on the planet for your readership guanids have been used for diabetes for hundreds of years the french lilac extracts have been used 300 years ago been description they didn't know what diabetes was at that time wasn't defined but patients with polyuria polydipsia were overweight treated with the extract the french lilac and their symptoms improved most studies if you look at were used at millimolar concentrations and again when they look at complex one inhibition which has been implicated to then lower atp raise adp and activate ampk it requires millimolar concentrations and so when you actually measure metformin in the patient who's taking one gram twice a day which is your maximal dose when pretty much the best efficacious dose your levels in plasma are about 30 to 50 micromolar so you could say even you know portal vein its pills are taken orally you give it two to three times that you're still talking about maybe 100 micromolar tenfold less than what all of these studies have been doing even both the in vitro studies and the literature and wells the in vivo studies giving levels that achieve millimolar concentrations so yes you see things complex one is an important it's an electron transporter it's important for function and health and you're going to see effects when you inhibit complex one at those high concentrations in my view they're not clinically relevant so the effects that i do think are clinically relevant that we have observed at 50 and 100 micromolar of metformin are really on the enzyme glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase the mitochondrial isoform that is required to move the protons from outside to inside the mitochondria and when you inhibit this enzyme nadh goes up nad goes down when you have this increase in the cytosolic redox you can't get lactate to pyruvate and you can't get glycerol to dhap so if i'm right it's going to be substrate dependent inhibition of gluconeogenesis whereas if you inhibit complex 1 and ampk or whatever mechanism downstream it should be gluconeogenesis independent of substrate and what we've shown both in vitro and in vivo most importantly in vivo in two or three different models metformin at these clinically relevant doses and concentrations only inhibit gluconeogenesis from glycerol and lactate it doesn't inhibit it from alanine or dhap or anything that does not depend on the cytosolic redox state this also explains why we rarely see clinically hypoglycemia on patients treated with metformin because there's these alternative gluconeogenic substrates that can come in alanine can keep coming out so you never see rarely unless they have another agent on top of metformin like insulin or su you rarely see it if ever and that's why also you see the lactic acidosis which is a fortunate toxicity of metformin where again it's specifically getting that lactate to pyruvate conversion which is dependent on the redox state so that's the mechanism i believe is clinically relevant and now last step is how is it inhibiting this enzyme i believe it's actually through an indirect effect on this enzyme that we'll hopefully have ready for prime time in in the year and do you think that in a healthy individual who's eating well is of normal weight is insulin sensitive and is exercising robustly metformin could actually be counteractive to benefit that's a profound question i don't know the answer to that and it gets into i don't know if you're going to take me there in terms of the use of metformin for aging healthy people are taking it for ag now i think that's why it's so important to understand this mechanism and then understand the implications of it it is redox is that a good thing or not for longevity and health that's a question that remains to be answered i find myself very much on the fence with that question while in the insulin resistant patient even without diabetes feeling that this is a very net positive agent but my personal views on it just based on clinical observation is that in the person i described earlier the lean insulin sensitive vigorously exercising individual it may actually not provide benefit but again there are studies in the works that are going to hopefully be able to provide some fidelity to understanding that i it sounds like you're equally kind of undecided on that as well yes well jerry i can't thank you enough again i say this to many people i interview but i really mean it here it's not just for this discussion and the time you put into it but obviously much more importantly for the career and for this incredible body of work that you've amassed through your pursuit and obviously remarkable collaborations with so many people i've enjoyed this discussion immensely that's actually one of the discussions i'm gonna have to probably go back and listen to again so i hope that a listener isn't hearing this and isn't discouraged by the fact that you're at this point in the discussion and you're thinking oh my god i might have only retained half of that that's okay i'm gonna be listening to this one and i just finished listening to it now and i'm going to listen to it again so thank you very much jerry for that thank you peter it's been a pleasure thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive
