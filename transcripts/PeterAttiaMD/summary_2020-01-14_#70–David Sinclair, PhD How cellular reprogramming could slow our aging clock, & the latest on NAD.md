## Description

Full title: #70 – David Sinclair, Ph.D.: How cellular reprogramming could slow our aging clock (and the latest research on NAD)

Original release date: 9/9/19

In this episode, David Sinclair, Ph.D., a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, returns to the podcast to discuss the content of his new book, Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don’t Have To. This conversation focuses on the biological mechanisms involved in what David terms the Information Theory of Aging which provides insights into the “clock” that determines our aging and to what degree it can be manipulated. Our discussion on aging of course leads us into interconnected topics of epigenetics, sirtuins, cellular senescence, as well as what compounds David is personally taking for his own longevity. Additionally, we discuss the most up to date information related to NAD and longevity by looking at the potential benefits (if any) of supplemental agents (NAD precursors, NR, NMR, etc.) that pose a promise of increasing NAD.

We discuss:
-SIR genes and cellular identity [8:45];
-Sirtuins regulate gene expression [14:30];
-DNA is methylated at the deepest layer of the epigenome [17:45];
-Methylation pattern and determining cellular age [20:15];
-Cellular reprogramming [33:45];
-Yamanaka factors to push cells “back in time”  [41:00];
-Human cellular reprogramming viability [57:00];
-Measuring the rate of aging [1:02:45];
-Cellular reprogramming for longevity [1:14:45];
-Compounds David takes for his own longevity [1:29:15]
-NAD precursors (NR, NMN) and pterostilbene [1:40:00];
-The current field of sirtuin activators [2:03:15];
-David’s artistic work [2:05:15] and;
-More.

About:

The Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking…and a few other things. With over 30 million episodes downloaded, it features topics including fasting, ketosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, mental health, and much more.

Peter is a physician focusing on the applied science of longevity. His practice deals extensively with nutritional interventions, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, emotional and mental health, and pharmacology to increase lifespan (delay the onset of chronic disease), while simultaneously improving healthspan (quality of life).

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive with David Sinclair:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on three main areas:
- The information theory of aging and how cellular reprogramming could potentially reverse aging
- Latest developments in NAD research and supplementation
- Discussion of David Sinclair's new book and its key concepts

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- DNA methylation serves as an aging clock that can predict biological age [32:28]
- Cellular reprogramming can potentially restore vision in aged mice [47:24]
- The Horvath clock can predict biological age with 95% accuracy [32:55]
- NAD levels decline with age and are crucial for sirtuin function [1:45:18]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider timing metformin away from exercise periods [1:30:52]
- Pulse biological stressors rather than constant exposure [1:34:48]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Resveratrol: 1 gram daily with fat-containing meal [1:33:45]
- NR (Nicotinamide Riboside): 1000mg discussed in recent studies [1:49:01]
- Metformin: Timing considerations discussed [1:29:54]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Exercise may be more effective without concurrent metformin use [1:30:52]
- Exercise creates beneficial stress response in cells [1:34:48]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Fasting discussed as biological stressor [1:33:12]
- Yogurt mentioned as delivery vehicle for resveratrol [1:33:45]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- DNA methylation patterns as aging biomarker [32:28]
- NAD levels in muscle tissue [1:49:01]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Horvath Clock research mentioned [32:55]
- Recent NR clinical trials discussed [1:49:01]
- David Sinclair's new book "Lifespan" referenced throughout

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"There's so much smoke out there that you have to believe there's a fire but I just don't know where it is" [2:00:09]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term safety data on cellular reprogramming
- Optimal timing and dosing of NAD precursors
- Integration of multiple longevity interventions
