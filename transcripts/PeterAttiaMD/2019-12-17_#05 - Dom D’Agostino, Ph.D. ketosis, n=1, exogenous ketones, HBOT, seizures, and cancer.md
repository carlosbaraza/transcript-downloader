## Description

Original release date: 7/16/2018

In this episode, Dom D’Agostino, one of the smartest people on all things related to ketones, digs deep into the research and application of these molecules. We discuss ketone esters, diesters and monoesters, racemic ketones, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), C8 (caprylic acid) on the exogenous ketone (EK) side of things. We also cover a lot of Dom’s fascinating work with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Dom also discusses the strategy and tactics of the metabolic management of cancer, which includes, but is certainly not limited to, a ketogenic diet (KD). Cancer is covered throughout this episode, but if there’s one section to listen to, skip ahead to the 2-hour mark and listen to what Dom has to say about the Press-Pulse approach.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of those successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you with a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at

[00:00:40] in this episode I interview my good friend Dominic D'Agostino Dom as he is known by his a professor at the University of South Florida his PhD is in neuroscience and that's where he got his background but DOM is probably most recognizable to people listening to this because he is certainly one of the experts on ketosis and that's in all variants of it so starvation ketosis nutritional ketosis and in particular the use of exogenous ketones gosh DOM and I go way back we met probably a little over five years ago and instantly formed a friendship around our obsessive and of one experiments although I will say he is closer to winning a Darwin Award on the basis of his and of one's than I am a couple notes about this podcast first this is highly technical at times and in fact will timestamp it in the show notes but I would say roughly the first hour is even a little more technical than I had intended to go I think part of the issue is just once I get talking with

[00:01:42] Dom about this stuff I couldn't stop asking him questions and I think there were times when I guess we forgot we were recording a podcast and it was just us getting really technical I don't think it's too technical to follow if you have some background understanding of biochemistry but we'll do our best in these show notes to make sure that we're given even the recreational user and necessary tools to follow this now that said if you get twenty minutes into this thing and you're like I don't understand what the hell these guys are talking about do not hesitate to skip ahead there's a lot of stuff that gets later on into the podcast and it is a

[00:02:13] Podcast it's nearly three hours there's a lot of stuff we get into at the end that I think will be kind of the stuff people really want to know even if they don't want to get in the gory details so in particular we talked very specifically about all of the ketones and I'm getting a lot of questions about

[00:02:28] Peter what's the difference being a ketone ester a ketone salt one of the mono esters what are the diaster is where does MCT fit into this what about the caprylic acid and you know how many should we be using this one versus this one and what are the advantages it's manages this is going to be your dissertation level course in that subject matter the other thing that we get into at the very end and we almost end on this but again look to the time stamps for exactly where it is is we get into what I consider one of the most interesting discussions I've ever had on what I sort of loosely describe as a metabolic oncologist playbook so when I asked Dom about this he had just some of the most interesting insights and I was really impressed by the breadth and the organization of his thinking around this now I want to point out something here and I say it in the show but it's really important for me to caveat this here this cannot be construed as medical advice DOM is not a medical doctor he doesn't pretend to be one on TV he is a research scientist who focuses on basic and translational research he collaborates with lots of physicians he is involved in a number of clinical trials but ultimately Dom is not offering medical advice and frankly nor is anybody or nor should anybody be on a podcast so this information I asked because I get asked this stuff a lot and frankly I don't know enough about this sort of outreaching and outlying metabolic therapies out there but I hope that if people are listening to this and they're afflicted by cancer which statistically speaking is obviously going to happen given that one in six people are gonna get cancer in their lifetime I hope that if some of this stuff does scratch someone's sort of desire to understand more that they can use some of the resources we're gonna link to to potentially identify the right places where either a clinical trial will be taking place or they could at least pursue some of these things under the appropriate medical guidance I could go on and on about other nits and gnats in here but honestly I think the best thing to do right now is probably pay a little bit of attention be more than usual to the shownotes treat this as a little bit like a buffet go to the places you want to go to of course I would recommend the entire thing if you really have an interest in this subject matter and I hope that this podcast is going to answer many of the questions that I see people asking out there I actually learned quite a bit on this and I tend to know the subject matter reasonably well so without any further delay welcome to the podcast with Dominic D'Agostino hey Dom aap how are you man nothing doing well how are you I'm doing really well and I'm really grateful for you making the trip all the way up here you know that in part you're visiting family but it's great that you've carved out time to come from New

[00:05:08] Jersey all the way up to the lovely city of Manhattan I appreciate the invite and love being here well there's gonna be a number of people listening to this today who are already incredibly familiar with who you are the work you've done I certainly consider you probably one of the two most authoritative persons on the subject we're gonna get into today but for anybody who's listening to this who is not entirely familiar with you I suspect by the end of today they're gonna want to get a lot more familiar with you so I actually remember the day we met and it's kind of funny I was in Florida giving that talk at IHMC yeah and I knew of you by name but I didn't know who you were or what you looked like so I wouldn't have recognized you when I gave a talk this would have been 2011 maybe maybe 2012 yeah and at the end of the talk there was like a Q&A and you know it was a long Q&A and it just went on and on and on and then you asked a question now I wish I could say I remember the question but I knew from the question that that guy knows what he's talking about and then of course Ken Ford who knew us both had basically arranged for us to all have dinner that night yeah and so that was the night we met yeah and it was really at least from my standpoint not to embarrass you it was like a love at first sight like I was like I was just so giddy to be able to sit there and have dinner with you the same same here yeah I knew who you were and I was looking for that talk I made the drive up there and I felt like we were connected before we even can did you know we're definitely on the same wavelength on on this stuff yeah you've got such an interesting history that we're gonna get into about how you got interested in this space but also I think one of the things that many people might not appreciate fully that I appreciated just because of the you know the convenience and luxury of how we met was just your interest in self experimentation as well and sometimes when you're studying something or interested in something that is not entirely mainstream yet you have to bootstrap it and you have to look at like limited amounts of animal data limited amounts of in vitro data and and then sometimes combined it with insights that you get through early experimentation on you know yours no absolutely so I immerse myself and what

[00:07:18] I'm doing I think that's sort of why that's how we learn yeah that's really that's the best way to learn so you did your PhD in neuroscience correct yeah so physiology tend physiology so you're finishing your PhD and you're what planning to do a postdoc yep I did it in the neural control of autonomic regulation so the brain stem mechanism sort of sense Oh to oxygen and co2 and modulate respiratory rhythm generation and also cardiovascular or sympathetic tone to the heart like those neurons and how they sense oxygen during in my PhD I got interested in diving physiology and it was amazing to me that we don't really understand how our brains and our physiology functions and extreme environments as it pertains to elevated hyperbaric pressure elevated oxygen co2 anesthetic gases for example we know the anesthetic potency of a gas is proportional to its width lipid solubility mm-hmm but we don't really know what that means like why what's happening at the level of the membrane of the mitochondria so my postdoctoral fellowship was actually developing technologies to study that and that would be hyperbaric atomic force microscopy and that was like that's what I just delved into for sure so how does that work so I know what hyperbaric means I know what microscopy means tell me about the part about the for the first term for atomic force microscopy was scanning probe microscopy okay and instead of using light or electrons it uses a very sharp tip probe that can be so sharp it's monoatomic and it essentially raster scans across the sample and can detect very subtle changes in the topography of the sample that you're scanning right so it actually spawned the whole nanotechnology world so this particular instrument was used to characterize materials and really help develop Silicon Valley in many ways and it's a microscope that we took basically an off-the-shelf atomic force microscope that gives you the scanning resolution of an electron microscope but also has the capacity to image living cells and took this technology and put it inside an environmental chamber a hyperbaric chamber and part of my project was doing the electrical the fluid and the gas penetrations to make the thing functional and also doing a series of studies and calibration tests to determine that we could reliably make hyperbaric atomic force microscopy measurements inside this chamber and with this technology it gives us insight at the nanoscopic level of what's happening to the mitochondria to the cell membrane so I get a grant through the Department of Defense which they give these equipment grants to develop this technology and also a grant to use it and later another grant to put a confocal microscope you might have heard of a laser it's Conny I actually used a confocal microscope in my undergrad thesis two optional optical sectioning of I know because I was an engineer so we were I was interested in a question of did the direction of extrusion that you put on a tibial plateau so when you do joint replacements does the direction in which you extrude what's called the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene does that predict its fracture and it turned out it did but now the tool to help us measure that was this confocal microscope so that was my introduction to high-end microscopy it's an amazing tool yeah so the second everyone yeah you got it through the toys that we have in the lab so that was the next phase of sort of my experiments was installing a laser scanning confocal so we could up at least section individual cells and look at the mitochondria inside the cells under graded levels of oxygen and hyperbaric pressure essentially pressure of an inert gas like helium nitrogen so to simulate for example a Navy SEAL dive or a deep-sea dive and in the context that developing this technology and imaging a wide variety of cells from primary neurons to Leo blastoma cells to human dermal fibroblasts smooth muscle cells

[00:11:30] I noticed that cancer cells would produce proportionately more superoxide anion which is the precursor oxygen free radical that comes from the mitochondrial electron transport chain as a consequence of normal metabolism and the cancer cells look to have what appeared to be their chock full of mitochondria and they were moving around very dynamic structures and under normal levels of oxygen they kind of produced a normal level of superoxide anion or oxygen free radicals but when we hit the cancer cells with hyperbaric oxygen the superoxide production went off the charts and it was very apparent to me that they were producing excess free radicals and as we made measurements over time it was very apparent that it was accelerating membrane and lipid peroxidation which we use a variety of tests one as a t-bars tests where we look at Mallon dialdehyde production and the technology the atomic force microscopy allows us to look at very subtle changes of the surface of the membrane you measure the perturbations on the surface of the membrane and nanoscopic changes and we look at membrane roughness and you could look at the roughness of the membrane and calculate that and that can correlate to membrane lipid peroxidation and it correlates the numbers correlate well so what you're looking at is the physical correlate of membrane lipid peroxidation when you capture that data with atomic force microscopy is that clear let me let me back up and make sure I can disagree at this in two steps so the first thing that you notice is lots of mitochondria in cancer cells and chock-full and these are what types of cancer lines the main one that I was working with that I ended up publishing the paper in neuroscience with was u-87 glioblastoma cells and they're taken out of a like a 44 year old piece of human a stone instead of line yeah a lot of people use it you know these are astrocytes right these are not neurons yeah of a glial yeah origin yes yes so observation one lots of mitochondria okay good to know because obviously there's a understanding that Warburg pointed out that says hey like you know these things largely are anaerobic not aerobic so they shouldn't really need much mitochondria yeah and then what you're saying is you put them into a hyperbaric environment and how hyperbaric how many times atmospheric pressure would you need I saw the observation and so normal oxygen is 0.28 ei we say atmospheres absolutely and I saw a big jump up in superoxide anion production at 0.95 so that's almost five times atmospheric pressure that's almost five times yeah and actually zero point nine five if you're breathing produces a po2 in the brain if similar to breathing 2.5 atmospheres of oxygen and then I actually went up to it did the experiment with three point two five atmospheres of oxygen and then that basically was cooking the cells from the inside out the mitochondria were producing so much oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species so superoxide anion can go to hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction through hydrogen peroxide and that can be driven in different ways and I basically saw the mitochondria exploding under hyperbaric oxygen conditions and I presume that if you have a control in this of non cancerous glial cells that are not doing the same thing yes of most of my experiments prior to this with like smooth muscle cells I was looking at and primary cortical neurons primary hippocampal neurons at the time I was just basically looking at I was doing these experiments to validate the tool that we had just built so no one actually had imaged living cells under hyper air conditions because no one had a hyperbaric microscope before so I didn't actually know what I was even looking at I was not a cancer biologist

[00:15:24] I knew that cancer cells were rapidly proliferating so they probably had amped up tabble ism but it was just a very interesting observation to me it was very interesting that they were also dying and I figured cancer cell should be Hardy and the you know she you should be able to throw everything but the kitchen sink at them and they should live and then when I saw them basically the mitochondria exploding and and the membrane starting to become permeable and you know necrotic cell death I became more and more interested in that and we ended up publishing the observation but I didn't actually know what it meant like I published it more like here I built this cool tool and we did this experiment and I was actually just looking at the cell line as a model system to study reactive oxygen species and oxygen toxicity seizures because part of the military was funding me to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of oxygen toxicity seizures and it's thought that high levels of oxygen creates oxidative stress and that perturbs the brain in a way that causes these grand mal tonic clonic seizures and we were developing tools you can't understand it unless you know fundamentally what's happening at the level of the cell and the mitochondria so I want to come back to that because that now makes sense for why diving could increase that risk because if you're using an oxygen rebreather you're getting a higher concentration of oxygen and then you're under multiple atmospheres of pressure even how basically replicated in an in a person yeah what you were seeing a cell but going back to the selfing for a sec do the free radicals that get generated destroy other cells beyond the cell that is generating the free radical or is the problem largely contained to this cell it's a dose-dependent phenomenon right and we were studying cells in this particular experiment in a petri dish or on a coverslip so yeah it's sort of like an intact neural network or cellular network so the cells are literally connected to one another unlike a tissue slice where you have an intact cytoarchitecture which that's a little bit different but the oxygen free radicals and the substance is that the cells produce do actually influence other cells adjacent to it or juxtaposed to it that's obvious from some of the experiments we do in cell signal like you know if one cell becomes permeable and we could detect cell death with various molecules like atheneum homodimer one when that cell dies it can stimulate excitotoxin events and surrounding cells same thing happens with the cancer cells it's obvious that cancer cells use reactive oxygen species for growth in proliferation and I know this is something that may be contradicting to many people we view free radicals is something that's damaging that the cell needs to get rid of but they're very powerful signaling molecules especially for cancer cells and growth in proliferation and in normal tissues and they mean nuclear signaling in nuclear signaling and activation of transcription factors basically there are many I study as neuroscientist I study redox sensitive ion channels so the redox state of an ion channel can dictate the permeability and the gating functions of that ion channel which is intimately linked to cellular excitability by influencing the resting membrane potential so as a neuroscientist you know you can study a very particular and cells have hundreds of thousands of ion channels of specific ion channels that are redox regulated but what was obvious is that cancer cells have elevated rates of reactive oxygen species that they use for growth and proliferation and also fuels metastasis and invasiveness of cancer cells and because they over produce oxygen free radicals in the context of high oxygen you can push the cells above their antioxidant potential and then trigger apoptosis so it's like a double-edge so it's a it's basically a u-shaped curve or inverted depending on how you want to think about it where exactly cancer cell is not only after by survivor it's optimized to thrive at a certain level of elevated reactive oxygen an elevated level but if you go too far it becomes counter yeah so they have elevated and dodges antioxidant capacity right but because their mitochondria are defective in many ways and there's that term is kind of controversial some people think the

[00:19:49] Warburg effect definitely endow the cells many benefits but the aberrant activity of the mitochondria is creating this excess free radicals and hyperbaric oxygen and chemo therapeutic drugs augment oxidative stress our therapeutic modalities that can be used it was very apparent to me seeing that in a hyperbaric chamber looking at a microscope looking at these cells and no one had seen it before because no one had hyperbaric tool yeah and that kind of steam at the same time I was growing these cells under different conditions I was very interested in lactate and I became interested in in ketones too just not for this reason I was not yet interested in the ketogenic diet I was I was looking at it for a different reason actually but I noticed that the cancer cells were not growing as rapidly as they should in the context of one two and five millimolar of beta-hydroxybutyrate which I was growing them in and I thought the lab tech may have been doing something that was influencing but she assured me it wasn't so we would pull the media off and put regular media on without the ketones and the cancer cells will start growing rapid why were you using ketones in the media well I was looking at a variety of different substrates back in two thousand eight and nine

[00:21:05] I see so you were just cozy yeah glucose bhp you know to deoxy glucose yeah lactate I was using a variety of German and ketones were like well let's just see what ketones do you know that ketones were something that the body would produce and fasting but I didn't I didn't even know the anti-seizure properties of the ketogenic diet I just thought of it as like what do brains and a couple odd papers I came out like ketones could be used as fuel I was very interested in alpha L poly lactate various forms of lactate that could be used to preserve brain energy metabolism in the face of oxidative stress and the ketones just they sort of shined so basically what they were able to do was allow the neurons to preserve their membrane potential and normal cellular function even in the context of extreme oxidative stress and it made sense right because the ketogenic diet you know I started looking more into this and discovered that the ketogenic diet is a very effective anti-seizure strategy even when drugs fail about two-thirds of patients respond favorably you get you know 10 or 15% or super responders that never have seizures again you can get them off your meds and it was probably working through a mechanism independent of any anti-seizure compound because the ketogenic diet worked when drugs failed you know suggesting it was working through a different mechanism or many mechanisms kind of in synchrony so the tools that we developed really sort of started to allow us to understand from a cellular and molecular mechanism how ketones are working and I was looking at other compounds at the time but it's just as I kept studying I was looking at

[00:22:48] Sigma receptor agonist I was looking at other antioxidants many different antioxidants and combinations of antioxidants that were catalase mimetics superoxide dismutase memetics you know all these things that were in theory they should work really well but nothing was really working as well as ketones and it also motivated me because when I discovered the ketogenic diet was a grossly underutilized anti-seizure strategy I was like wow I could go back to my nutrition roots because when I was undergrad I majored in nutrition science but I didn't pursue a PhD in nutrition because nutrition was not like a real science like there was no job sintra trician and in the 90s was a decade of the brain so it was like let me try to get into a cellular neuroscience program so I kind of just left nutrition and this was my opportunity to bring nutrition back into my research projects into the lab but my going back to that

[00:23:46] BH be in the media yeah did you have the same amount of glucose in as you had in the BHB free media yeah so we did everything in the context of the same amount of glucose 5 million benefit was from the addition of BHB got the reduction of glucose absolutely yep and as I started to get into the literature and read into this a little bit more we started doing glucose subtraction and adding ketones and saw that normal healthy neurons functioned and thrived in a low glucose environment if the ketones were present but the cancer cells would die and this was also replicated and published in various neuro blastoma cell lines and I think

[00:24:32] Skinner was one a person that published I found that he was at University of Florida but he was a dude who's a fellow and just had left the school at the time and then I went up there and gave a talk I think in 2010 and that further that got me more and more interested in [Music] studying cancer even though it was not funded to do so it was like this pet project that was completely very intellectually stimulating to me and something that I could not just shelf and come back to at a later time I had to I felt like the environment was kind of hot for this so I just kept reaching out to different scientists and showing them my data and asking them to explain it like top-level cancer biologists and then I had stumbled across Tom Seaford actually speculating why do you think

[00:25:18] Tom was one of the few people that latched on to this was it simply because he'd already been thinking the same things or because it's really it is interesting when you think about how many really interesting and impressive people in cancer have not sort of come around to thinking about this stuff now in 2009 I think it was 2009 and I'm sure you know have read this paper a thousand times it's sort of I think it was the first obvious mainstream view of this was the Matt Vander Heiden Luke ant

[00:25:45] League Craig Tom's in science paper yes i do-- nine right which reminded me of they had a couple papers around that time well this is the one that offered an explanation for the Warburg effect yeah yeah there was really an energy synthetic that's right it was or expanding the biomass directing metabolites do that yep and that was interesting because that's a different explanation than presumably Tom would offer right it's accepting the Warburg effect is it very powerful but the question that tom has really set out to address no one is arguing the Warburg effect is present present but the initiation of the Warburg effect that damaged mitochondrial respiration causes an energetic crisis that kicks on the oncogene z' that basically turn on the genes that are the essence of the

[00:26:38] Warburg effect it's more let's describe a fran yeah i'm gonna take for granted that everyone listening knows what the Warburg effect is so for someone who doesn't know how would you explain the Warburg effect the Warburg effect simply stated is insufficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or what we call respiration with compensatory fermentation in the form of establishing the cell establishes its energy its production of ATP our energy currency through the like pollicis and substrate level phosphorylation and it's well recognized that cancer cells 90% of them

[00:27:18] I would say have a Warburg phenotype meaning that they have highly accelerated glycolysis and substrate level phosphorylation so let me simplify that a little bit more our cells can turn glucose into something called pyruvate and that occurs outside of the mitochondria and that's not a highly energy efficient process it doesn't generate much ATP you then have a decision to make as a cell which is basically how quickly does the body want

[00:27:48] ATP and as a general rule when it wants it quickly it's an anaerobic environment if you think about things that drive quick ATP requirement and so then it will just say look we'll just turn this pyruvate into lactate that's a glycolytic pathway which is not particularly efficient either it doesn't generate that much more ATP but it has the luxury of saying

[00:28:07] I can guarantee to do this quickly and I don't need to be limited by cellular oxygen under ideal circumstances you would want to generate the most ATP you would shuttle that pyruvate into the mitochondria as acetyl co a and you have this other process so what you're saying is the Warburg effect is hey even under conditions at rest a cancer cell seems to disproportionately do this glycolytic thing and it generates its ATP that way as opposed to going into the mitochondria exactly even in the presence of normal oxygen it utilizes glycolysis and pumps out lactate so under no other conditions do normal cells ferment and pump out lactate so that a Warburg did he win a

[00:28:52] Nobel Prize for this observation he won a Nobel Prize yeah for his work in metabolism cancer cells yeah and it was is more kind of appreciated a little bit later what the implications of this was but it was part of his Nobel Prize and you know I remember reading an article about this once that has since escaped me but then maybe I'm wrong so correct me but one of the reasons that the hypothesis was this was in the 1920s if

[00:29:16] I recall yeah it was yeah so one of the reasons that this sort of got discarded for lack of a better word or at least ignored was people tended to focus on the exceptions and there were exceptions right certain lung cancers certainly seem to pose an exception to the Warburg effect and so the idea was we'll look if you have an exception than the rule is not so much a rule anymore and is there another reason why the Warburg effect was largely ignored for you know a generation and a half to two generations

[00:29:41] Travis Kristofferson wrote a book called tripping over the truth that nicely sums that up I think there's a lot of reasons for that but I think the the big focus was on understanding the gene pathways that were associated with carcinogenesis and then if we can understand the gene etiology of cancers and different types of cancers then that would explain cancer in a much more fundamental level and that is the case there is a dynamic interplay between metabolism and genetics so now we have an appreciation that metabolites you could call them unko metabolites are epigenetic drivers and metabolism is just not something it's just not producing ATP there are so many different intermediates and redox signaling and and so many different signaling molecules from metabolism that have epigenetic regulation and I think that has become when I got into this there was no cancer metabolism conferences you know and now there's a dozen or more where Luke Antley is the keynote speaker and Craig Thompson is this has all sort of exploded shortly after some of these observations that I made and it's just you know it's I don't think it's coincidence I think you remember that nice yeah yeah I remember when we had that dinner in DC at that calm Georgetown calm yeah I still look back at that is most remarkable rooms to be sitting in as a fly on the wall because there was only had 12 people there yeah and you know you had Luke cantly you had Michael Bishop Steve

[00:31:17] Rosenberg David Sabatini who else was there Michael Vanderheiden yep Matthew candor and I mean you basically have their most thoughtful cancer scientists in the in the world certainly in the United States in one room and that was an amazing read conversation yeah yeah that's if I go back into time exactly it's golden we'll talk those guys into getting in a room again yeah I mean I think what you're basically saying is look part of its reason for being discarded or at least forgotten about was a new sexier idea emerged which is hey we started to understand the role of the genome and there's this weird sort of debate you hear and the observation that things like viruses you know which could you know encode and change our DNA yes but the viruses that cause cancer are the very same viruses that damage the mitochondria that damaged the DNA in the mitochondria and causing respiratory insufficiency which triggers an energetic crisis which can trigger the activation of oncogene through retrograde response so that needs to be appreciated too but there's this explosion of technologies that allowed us to understand genetics and that was sort of being leveraged to really delve into cancer I think it was doing some politics influencing that so is the first thing you did from that point because there's really two separate problems that you're talking about the first is why are these seizures occurring and I'm referring very specifically to your DARPA funded work which was why is it that when these special forces guys are doing their ultra-secret dives which require rebreathers why are a subset of them having these fatal seizures well it's the at the office of Navy research it was also start okay I was doing a severed they were doing more fighter performance with ketones esters just prior to you know what I was doing so so that's one problem yeah and the other problem that's that you've also articulated is hey what's going on with answers yes yes so oxygen toxicity seizures are a limitation for Navy SEAL divers and we don't know how to predict them or prevent them it's also a limitation of hyperbaric oxygen therapy right so if you have carbon monoxide poisoning right and you need to live you need to get that that carbon dioxide off your hemoglobin you need to basically increase the po2 in your tissues Oh carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity than oxygen for hemoglobin so you have yep basically out-compete it yes so if you were to take a ketone ester which we know now increase your resistance to oxygen toxicity by like six hundred percent and take a ketone ester and get inside a hyperbaric chamber you have a much greater chance of living if you have wounds there's fourteen different applications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy we think that therapeutic ketosis strategy would make it much safer and more efficacious so in the context of an oxygen rebreather the advantage is that there's a stealth component because you don't produce bubbles you can dive in a quiet lake and go all the way across and surprise your enemy but it's just 50 feet of sea water within 10 minutes at 50 feet of sea water you run the risk of getting oxygen toxicity seizures that's pretty shiny

[00:34:31] I'd say that again at 50 feet 50 feet of sea water ten minutes you're on a dragger rebreather according to the oxygen dive tables that has been enough to trigger a seizure in many guys so that produces a po2 in your brain about roughly two thousand times higher than what your your oxygen level in your brain would be right now 2,000 percent so that needs to be sort of sort of appreciated and of course this could all be averted if you just stick to the dive tables right but if you have you know enemy fire with 50 caliber machine guns coming down on you and you want to stay down if the water is clear you got to go down deeper if you have a plan of mind and get to the bottom of a ship or a bridge you you might be underwater for three or four hours and the enemy's still up there and it's you got to get down there and do your job and dive deep and avoid that and then you know after a time you have pulmonary oxygen toxicity too if you're down there long enough but generally speaking these are breathers or for shallow diving but situations where they need to go down deeper do you have an estimate of how many Navy divers just in the United States both in training or combat would would die in a in a given year from this or be injured it's pretty rare fortunately is pretty rare and if they do get hit with oxygen you know our friend Kurt parsley will tell you that

[00:35:51] Navy SEALs NART aureus about not telling what their issues are or their health right so if they do have a seizure they would be kicked out you know a lot of these guys because that may make them a weak link that they're vulnerable so we know recreational divers that push the limit who have been hit a couple times you know with this and we're doing some studies right now recreational divers so it's very underreported but studies have shown I always show a video in one of my talks of a guy in a chamber where he has a mask on and the mask is breathing 100 percent oxygen and the guy inside the chamber is breathing hyperbaric air and within at 2.7 atmospheres of oxygen he gets hit with a seizure and has a really violent tonic-clonic seizure and it stopped as soon as you remove the oxygen mask and start breathing air even if it's a the same barometric pressure the seizure stop so one of the beneficial things of these seizures if you want to if there's a beneficial component to it is that they quickly stop as soon as you remove the hyperbaric oxygen source or you go from breathing 100% oxygen to hyperbaric air so what's happening is that the high levels of oxygen are creating oxidative stress and actually impeding various metabolic processes in the brain and the brain is becoming hyper excitable and the neurons are firing so many action potentials that the cells sent essentially can't maintain their membrane potential and you get excited toxicity that causes mass firing in the neurons and a seizure right and this is obviously under a very

[00:37:31] Supra physiologic super physiologic it only happens you know in these extreme environments of pressures and and the reason for it now is kind of you have s nitrous elation of glutamic acid decarboxylase there's two different isozymes and then what we think now is that you have more glutamate to gaba ratio so the enzyme that converts our gamma amino butyric acid have actually created from glutamate right so you have much more excitatory than inhibitory neurotransmitter so that ratio changes and it's a redox dependent reaction actually it's a you have s nitro solution of this enzyme that converts more glutamate to gaba so you have increased neuronal firing and increase release of glutamate and also less conversion of the glutamate to gaba which has a brain stabilizing effect so this is going off topic for just a second but we know that as people age we see greater and greater oxidative damage so we see you know the susceptibility to our OS going up does any of what you learned in this supra physiologic environment we're in a very short period of time you're gonna generate a ton of ross by exposing someone to high pressure and high o2 does anything you learned in that environment offer an insight into non super physiologic or normal aging and disease progression yeah I think in many different ways so it's almost like exercise right if you exercise intensely your reactive oxygen species are going to go up inflammation all these things kick on so high pressure oxygen increases oxidative stress and that kicks on many different processes that can endow the cell with greater cellular protection so it can for example cause an increase in superoxide dismutase it can enhance enhance our antioxidant defenses so the oxidative stimulus is a trigger for adaptive processes that can allow our systems to be more resilient against the same level of oxidative stress this happens very robustly in a young animal and is significantly attenuated in in an older animal and I think that needs to be appreciated so the adaptive response to the stimulus is varies genetically probably between the individual there's a lot of individual variability between people and even if you take the same person under different conditions whether it be if they're sleep-deprived what they ate that day they're maybe if they're dealing with a little viral illness or something their susceptibility to oxygen toxicity seizures can be greatly affected by a lot of different variables but that adaptive response so we know hyperbaric oxygen stimulates the production of stem cells as much as something like gm-csf like neupogen or lue kind like it's that powerful it causes the production and the release of stem cells which kind of hone in on sites of injury and aid in repair so that's why it's it's most utilized application is actually for enhancing wound wound production there are wound healing effects I see you mentioned that there were 14 approved applications I wasn't aware that there were that many I certainly I think it's 15 now so what are some of the others not to put you on the spot to rattle off all 15 but we can look it up but you're just on top of your head what other ones do you know yeah radiation necrosis so for cancer you are getting radiation therapy for cancer it is FDA approved for that so if you have patients you know whose have radiation therapy of course there's decompression sickness so we're recreational diving if you get bent another term for bents is decompression you know it's the same deal it's basically getting nitrogen out by basically just nitrogen out yeah beating it out with oxygen yep carbon dioxide obviously diabetic wounds all the hyperbaric the uhms so hyperbaric medicine Society approves the facilities and I would say 90 plus percent of their revenue generated from that is diabetic wounds which is a huge problem like you probably in your practice you probably see people with wounds that just don't heal well I don't see to my practice but

[00:41:51] I certainly cut my teeth on it during residency yeah no pun and a significant problem yep so that's I mean that's a few different applications and there's a lot of sort of rare things or noise induced hearing loss if you use that's one of the newer applications that can be so some things that are kind of counterintuitive so when we think of high pressure oxygen a lot of times you think of retinopathy of prematurity right if you put a newborn and give them high levels of oxygen you could cause them to go blind a newborn so that's an interesting meaning a newborn is more susceptible or susceptible to to oxygen it was very common I guess you could say to put newborns on high levels of oxygen if they were born premature and what is it about the newborn that makes the development of their lungs is it the angiogenic component of this it yes yes that could be a component too and maybe they just don't have the robust endogenous antioxidant you know capacity that probably might be the angiogenic component - do you know if the top of your head if elevated mercury or mercury toxicity is an indication for hyperbaric because I've heard of a lot of people doing this but it strikes me as a little there's so much off-label stuff being done so one of the things that I'm really interested in testing is for traumatic brain injury and I do think that low levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy if used shortly after a traumatic brain injury

[00:43:16] I think the faster you restore oxygenation the more likely you are to salvage those neurons so ideally you want to treat with something that's going to re-establish energy and neurons decrease inflammation and increase oxygenation to hypoxic pockets and I think from my perspective giving something like a ketone ester with lower levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy would probably work that's probably the by far the most controversial application because there's some remarkable responses from people who have even a regeneration of brain cells after the hypoxic injury for example in kids who are very resilient anyway I know dr. Paul harsh you know has been on pretty much all the major news networks with it was a girl that sustained an incredibly severe hypoxia injury and brain death and regenerated some of her brain brain function and brain tissue how old was the girl she was pretty young I think five or six I believe and I met her actually one of the conference's and it's very clear that nothing was working for her until she did hyperbaric oxygen therapy so but kids are completely could be another story you know we don't know if we could replicate that but there are a lot of stories out there anecdotal reports but it just has not been studied appropriately and those studies need to be done and what do you see is there resistance I mean when you look at what's happened in the last five years in the NFL that has brought along with I think just the returning vets TBI is I mean I don't think you could walk down

[00:44:58] Madison Avenue and hit someone with a rock who hadn't at least heard the term TBI so everybody knows what it is we've got you know these two completely different demographics who are highly affected by it athletes and soldiers what's the hang-up I mean you and I have spent a lot of time behind the scenes trying to get organizations like the NCUA interested in studying this I'm struggling to understand what the hang-up is you know they're looking for devices to you know quantify TBI is and concussions so that's a lot of funding is going into that that area at least when we talk about the NFL hit challenge and something that you know we submitted to you know I don't really know I don't really know I think the scientific rationale for a metabolic based therapy for the brain makes a lot of sense and restoring oxygenation

[00:45:51] I think the waters are very muddy though when it comes to hyperbaric oxygen with a TBI because I mean we even did some rat studies where repeated doses of hyperbaric oxygen in a concussion or a brain injury model Iraq caused more injury can exacerbate the effects whereas a single dose of hyperbaric oxygen right after at least in our rat model decrease the infarct size by maybe 30 something like that so this is dangerous

[00:46:22] I mean we don't want someone listening to this who's suffered a TBI thinking I'm gonna go to some off-label clinic and just max you know repeatedly expose myself to hyperbarics I mean we the point here is this has to be studied it has to be studied rigorously it has to be said it empirically and then we haven't even gotten to something we will get into later which is the potential augmentation of the exogenous ketone yeah yeah I would not do hyperbaric oxygen therapy if people are gonna do it with and without you know what I say I would definitely do hyperbaric oxygen therapy if you're gonna do it in strong nutritional ketosis because a consequence of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is could be CNS oxygen toxicity so you do not the last thing you want if you have a brain injury is to have a seizure and we know 85% of all penetrating traumatic brain injuries lead to seizures and people who've had penetrating what about blunt it's less than that but how much yeah so I don't know I guess you'd have to quantify the blunt of severity yeah but when it comes to penetrating but it's it's it's upwards about 85% of penetrating traumatic brain injuries have seizures and that's because you have excess glutamate you know and that's a very thing that's actually contributing to oxygen toxicity seizures right so I think the biggest thing to do is to augment your brain energy metabolism to burn energy more efficiently the ketones do that and lower neuro inflammation and I think there's a variety of ways to do that but you don't want to throw more fuel on the fire and I think high levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy could be doing that I think maybe these soft chambers that go to like 1.4 1.5 may be a better means to implement that let's get into ketosis a little bit I want to come back and talk about cancer I want to come back and talk about the exogenous ketones both the salts the esters and even different molecules but one of the most interesting experiments we've seen in the physiology of ketones like you know as far as old-school experiments was the

[00:48:26] George Cahill starvation experiments right I was highly motivated by that study we're gonna link to it here but that's why don't you give people the Reader's Digest version of what George Cahill did that could probably never be done again yeah yeah and I was I was very lucky to connect with him before he died he passed away in 2012 I connect with him a few years before that and just to figure out you know did he really do this he studies and there was a lot of studies that also didn't get published that were pretty remarkable too that somehow they got passed ethics review at Harvard

[00:48:58] Medical School but essentially what he did a very elegant study to look at brain energy metabolism the AV difference in blood and metabolites in subjects that fasted for 40 days and most of the subjects were divinity students I believe or may be conscientious objectors to the war or something like that but each person had like a different story behind it and he fasted these subjects for forty days and just to be clear yeah water and mineral only water no calories yeah yeah sodium they did I think they took a mineral supplement and they also were they weren't lean subjects so they were subjects who from their perspective were overweight if not obese subjects so they had some weight to lose and it was very well documented and well controlled study where they monitored free fatty acids insulin glucose beta-hydroxybutyrate acetyl acetate and acetone and let's all just pause you there for a moment for the listener we'll come back to this because I want you to explain the difference between beta hydroxy butyrate or BHB acetoacetate or ack-ack and acetone how they're produced which ones are metabolically active which ones aren't but hopefully by me just saying this between the two of us will remember to come back to that yeah so yes essentially three ketone bodies beta hydroxy butyrate being the primary ketone that's elevated and more stable in the blood and probably more likely to be a brain fuel so and if we just focus on that ketone body after seven days it reached the level to where it was at or above the level of glucose in the subject so glucose came down five to six million molar down to three and stayed at three millimolar throughout the duration of the experiment throughout the duration of the fast from day seven essentially to the remainder of the forty days so for the

[00:50:54] Yankees listening to this who aren't familiar with the metric system three millimolar is about 55 milligrams per deciliter yeah so that's pretty darn low yeah but what's interesting is it gets down there I think it was between day seven and day ten and hit three millimolar and then it just never went down again yeah yeah what the heck is going on these people don't eat any glucose how how do they sell and what that tells you by definition is their liver still had glycogen because that you have to be putting that glucose out yeah from the liver yep so the maintenance of glucose is under very powerful homeostatic mechanisms so we have we're hardwired from an evolutionary perspective to maintain glucose and the glucose can be coming from gluconeogenic amino acids so we are breaking down some muscle and then the glycerol backbone of triglycerides to also contributes to the production so triglycerides being the storage form of fatty acids you have a three carbon backbone that's called a glycerol backbone it has three of these free fatty acids that are will they become free once they're cleaved they become the substrate that you're going to explain to us in a few minutes is how you make bhp or beta-hydroxybutyrate but you don't just throw that glycerol out you connect the liver can turn that back into glycogen within itself - then yeah slowly trickle out into the bloodstream exactly yep so when Cahill did this if I recall insulin levels also got very low by with about by day seven the insulin levels were you know at rock-bottom and sort of stayed there yeah yeah one of the interesting things about the experiment well in addition to the stuff I want to hear about which is the brain metabolism and how did the brain partition those fuels is was it this experiment or a different one where he was able to give insulin lower glucose levels but not generate CNS trauma through that yeah so the subjects were asymptomatic for hypoglycemia and they felt really fine and in another round level like 1 millimolar so he they infused IV infusion of 20 I use of insulin and pushed glucose from 3 millimolar or there abouts down to roughly 1 millimolar which is like less than 1 milligrams per deciliter which would be fatal that would the universe fatal even to to becomes like coma and essentially fatal if it's maintained I hit 2 very briefly yeah during an insulin suppression test

[00:53:26] I had at Stanford and I was no longer in ketosis yeah because I was doing this in social pressing test so I started at about two and a half or three millimolar but ninety minutes later my ketones had withered down to like point three point four yeah and then my glucose hit about 38 milligrams per deciliter and I really

[00:53:45] I that was the day that's what I was no area oh yeah no I thought I was going I have a little self experiment I can mention after this but essentially what they did which was a very bold and gutsy demonstration they injected insulin which facilitated glucose disposal and the patients essentially and brought blood glucose down to you know roughly 1 millimolar which is universally fatal and the subjects were relatively asymptomatic for hypoglycemia which was remarkable their ketones were maintained at about above 5 to 6 million molar that is out freaking rageous like yeah when you just stop to think about how you could take a normal healthy volunteer and do something and we're all in the spirit of learning but when you just think about that from an ethical standpoint I'm not allowed to do that in my is the aya cook the Institute for Animal Care Committee you know would not approve fasting for more than 48 hours I think it's for 24 hour institution yeah so that's for mice and maybe rats might be 48 but yeah and the use of insulin to further you know that would I'm I serve on the aya cook I mean these things would be quickly rejecting this is this was the

[00:55:02] Wild West yeah and yeah and and then just the last thing on this topic that I remember which I'd love you to expand on is what did we learn about how the brain partitioned fuel how much of the brains energy once you were in that steady state after about 10 days came from glucose beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate mm-hmm yeah so beta-hydroxybutyrate accounted for approximately 60% of the energy and probably 10% acetyl acetate and roughly at that point after about 10 days only about a third of the energy was coming from glucose right and basically what's in your blood as far as ketones and glucose is what your brain is utilizing you know your brains in a hungry state and it's effectively utilizing and clearing those those metabolites you can do that it was very elegant demonstration and it kind of changed our understanding of brain energy metabolism as glucose being exclusive predominant fuel so in a fed state they were consuming 100 percent of their brain energy metabolism was from glucose right but only after being fasted did that change and he went on to write a number of reviews and went on with dr. beech who actually created and developed some the they published together he was a postdoc with Cato was a postdoc yeah he was a student of Hans crab actually and then yeah he was one of them yeah he was one of his best students from my understanding yeah from word of mouth yeah they went and they worked together in different capacities yeah I think he might have been a fellow with him I think most people listening to this if they can dig back to high school biology and that that named Krebs will sort of ring a bell right yeah so you mentioned that that Cahill shared with you stuff that wasn't even published do you remember anything that was that struck you as super interesting that was unpublished yeah you know some things maybe not worth talking about oh yeah I don't know if he lied there was some stories and then I heard some stories through other people too well I don't want to make you say anything that you're not comfortable saying I would say that some of the work that was done in animals definitely suggested that glucose could go lower even lower and that you could really transition your metabolic physiology to be fueled off fats and ketones and and that that was against what we knew these were remarkable observations that change the whole context of what we knew about metabolic physiology and brain energy metabolism do we know today if the brain can use lactate directly as a fuel without it having to go through the Cori cycle yeah most certainly can I think I think lactates actually a great fuel and that's one of the first fuels I got interested in when I was studying hypoxia and then later even hyperoxia was thinking about using lactate in different forms of orally available locked a like poly L lactate you know I think it's in the product site of Max if you remember for cycling I used to yeah so I I was actually interested in that and that actually led me to ketones and then once I got more into studying ketones and discovered somehow it slipped past me all the years I thought

[00:58:18] I knew what a ketogenic diet was but then when I read about the history of the ketogenic diet being used for almost a century and I realized that it was like the standard of care for seizures and then understanding that these ketones can largely replace glucose as the energy source and then they have these signaling properties that are even independent of metabolism that are remarkable over the last five years a lot of these big labs are looking at the epigenetic effects of ketones functioning as class 1 class 2 history know the functioning as a suppressor of the nlrp3 inflammasome producing less inflammation in a metabolic independent way so you obviously pretty quickly come to this idea that these ketones are interesting molecules and they're interesting for a couple of reasons at the very least what you just said which is they have signaling properties that make them kind of unique outside of the eggs on genna's ketones though you have to also undergo a pretty extreme physiologic change at least in a Western culture to make enough of these to matter and you have to restrict carbohydrates and protein to get there so did you first personally get interested in this from a nutritional standpoint and then eventually through this exhaustion Espace way or vice versa yeah so ketone esters to my knowledge in 2008 didn't exist they actually did but

[00:59:43] I didn't I didn't know of them I discovered them on a DARPA website as some work that was being funded you know in developing of the ketone esters for warfighter performance but at the time when I just decided to go down the route of the ketogenic diet I reached out to Johns Hopkins and and the crew there is where anti-seizure therapy was pioneered right yeah a Mayo Clinic first and then they work together with Hopkins I would say the bulk of the work that was done to develop the protocols for the qje diet which are in use today was developed at Johns Hopkins and I got

[01:00:19] Eric Haas off his book with published with John Freeman which was I just went out and did the classical ketogenic diet the four to one ratio so for parts fat and one part being protein and carbohydrates it weights out 287 to upwards of 90% fat maybe 10% protein and like one or two percent carbohydrates so

[01:00:42] I mean it's like basically eating super low carb and then adding mountains of fat on top of that plate making like a super low carb meal with protein restrict and then add some butter and a couple cups of heavy cream with that and that's I started weighing everything out and what year did you start the 2008 I think in nine I think it was 2008 or nine that Eric Haas off published the modified ketogenic diet which was more liberal and protein and increasing protein from ten percent to 25 and 30 percent or 25 percent is a huge difference like you can that's actually a diet that I mostly adhere to now and I followed the ketogenic diet and I bought the strip's were very expensive at the time there was a couple different kits that I got to measure my own ketones and you know I immerse myself in it I got obsessed with it and I wanted to know what it felt like to have a brain that ran on ketones and how high did your levels get measured in the blood I kind of struggled to get up there even with the classical ketogenic diet 2 and 2.5 I would typically with the classical kid and this is before MCTS so I wasn't quite using MC teas yet in 2009 I started incorporate the same time

[01:01:59] I discovered the modified ketogenic diet was the same time I started using MC teas and a modified ketogenic diet with MC T's got my ketone levels up probably higher than the classical ketogenic diet which was just mostly you know a dairy based long-chain fat sort of derive diet so let's tell everybody how we make ketones and then we'll tell them what an

[01:02:22] MC T is for them yeah so let's talk about starvation ketosis and then if there's differences between that that are worth highlighting with nutritional that would be great but evolutionarily I'm going to deprive you from eating for a few days how do you survive well you start burning up your liver glycogen okay so when it's 24 hours later you've got that down to about half of its yeah half to let a quarter of its supply mm-hmm through the suppression of the hormone insulin we started mobilizing fat from adipose tissue which our cells pretty much all cells in the body especially muscle and heart cells burn fat like superior energy source long-chain fatty acids don't effectively cross the blood-brain barrier so through accelerated fat oxidation beta oxidation of fats in the liver that stimulates the accumulation of acetyl co a which forms acetyl acetate and ultimately beta hydroxy butyrate so you start spilling these ketone bodies through accelerated fat oxidation in the liver the liver lacks sucks Neel Cody transferase so does not actually use the ketone bodies for fuel and they become available for your brain a central nervous system and peripheral so the liver is secreting beta hydroxy butyrate and there's no acetate to some extent okay so is the pH B being made and then being converted into acetyl acetate or is the liver making both I see no acetate first and then beta hydroxy butyrate and it's interesting that some people have a ratio beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate of two to one and some people five to one generally speaking about four to one so acetoacetate is unstable in that it can spontaneously decarboxylate to acetone which is volatile and we blow it off in our breath does it have metabolic activity can we it was thought that it didn't but more recent work is suggesting that the carbons of acetone do find their way into sort of lipid biosynthesis and some other things but it's kind of rare for it's not a great 80 piece or not no not not really it has some effect on neurons so it has an anticonvulsant effect through I believe opening a potassium channel which could hyperpolarize a membrane potential and actually help attenuate some hyperexcitability in the brain so there are people that study you know the effects of acetone as a sub narcotic levels of acetone right acetone can be pretty narcotic and be problematic but acetone levels that are 0.5 milli molar and even upwards of 1 millimolar can have a neuro protective effect once you get above 1 millimolar you start to dissolve some of the membranes and you can have sort of it doesn't sound yeah you have problematic you know acetone is a pretty powerful solvent right it's a nail polish remover but small levels of acetone and or protective and that's actually is something that we study so how do acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate enter the krebs cycle in other words where do we get ATP from them it depends on the the cells so different cells have different and we're looking at this now different keto lytic enzymes right so they can feed in through a number of different pathways like I said the liver is the production site of beta-hydroxybutyrate and when it comes to skeletal muscle they have a range of catalytic enzymes that can allow them to enter the Krebs cycle at different different areas so succinate for example so you can replenish TCA cycle intermediates with succinate you can acetoacetate can break down and provide acetyl co a before the Krebs like so what we're finding is that the krebs cycle is not the simple cycle that we thought it was especially as it relates to cancer cells so it's almost like we can't even look at the biochemistry book and kind of pinpoint different pathways with substrate level phosphorylation there are a number of different pathways like the malate aspartate shuttle that are associated with cancer cells if we go back to those paths did you see that paper that came out in nature two days ago about aspartate being a rate limiting step in cancer metabolism in the mitochondria I didn't see that

[01:06:48] I haven't Bob and I were just talking about it today it's interesting because the paper was part of it was written through a lens of hey this might be how metformin can exert some of its anti-cancer benefits by interfering with aspartate I think it was interfering with degradation of aspartate but again

[01:07:04] I haven't read the paper yet just sort of the abstract but it was yet another like I didn't know that Wow yeah every day I feel like I'm feel like I'm getting dumber because the rate at which I'm being exposed to new information is exceeding the rate at which I'm is assimilating it so it just it feels like I'm on a downward spiral to stupidity there are textbook pathways that I used to just rattle off and it's all seems so simple and then you know I read three or four papers and I realized that I probably shouldn't talk about it in some simplistic terms like that and you know we're kind of going down the rabbit hole of glutamine Oasis right so glutamine is the the fermentable fuels so ketones are a non fermentable fuel whereas cancer cells will use glucose and glutamine as the two primary fermentable fuels now it's funny i I mean I know that biochemically I'd never thought of it in those terms though yeah yeah it's not fermentable that's interesting so that's kind of what I'm thinking about you know in terms of ketone metabolism with glutamate so or glutamine glutamine can make glutamate right an alanine and aspartate and lactate and glutamine

[01:08:15] Oasis is kind of driven by the malli aspartate shuttle and that has become a major focus now of many cancer researchers are looking to target glutamine it's not it's not easy I mean cuz you happen if you have a glutamine ease and hibbott ER that has tremendous side effects huge talk so citrate yeah so we need to approach this in a very nuanced sort of way when it comes to targeting glutamine yeah so let's go back to the MCT so you talked about how you started out on a four to one ratio which is interesting I started out four to one I spent three years on just four to one I never deviated from four to one but then you mentioned you went to two to one which is obviously much easier to do but you augmented with M C T so M C T of course stands for medium chain triglyceride they're a type of saturated fat and they're of a certain length and

[01:09:03] I don't even remember anymore is it 8 to 14 carbons is what we define as MCT yeah 8 to 10 I think 8 to 14 from in that but when we talk about the ketogenic ones the they're more close they're closer to caprylic acid is the c8 yep so why does that bring why doesn't taking those make this process easier when you consume them orally they are transported to the liver via a hepatic portal circulation and they're not packaged into chylomicrons and you know long-chain fatty acids when we eat them they are packaged in the chylomicrons and then they go through essentially enter the lymphatic system and have a different route of entry they were metabolized totally differently whereas medium chain fats go directly to the liver through a patek portal circulation it's like a bolus of fat going to the liver and it's a type of fat that's rapidly oxidized right the liver is chock full of mitochondria so if I want to study mitochondria I'll take out a chunk of the liver and isolate it from that because that's the easiest thing to do so the mitochondria really burn up medium chain triglycerides very quickly and there's very high rates of fat oxidation the liver from an oral bolus of medium chain triglycerides so they're much less likely to be stored as fat their source of calories and they can be incorporated into meals and into foods to further enhance and boost the ketone levels of the ketogenic diet or even if you're not on acute they can be consumed with a high carbohydrate diet and actually elevate ketones in the blood yeah I mean I've heard that but I've never actually measured it probably because I've only done this with liquid MCT which you end up getting two sort of GI tolerance becomes an issue probably before you get a high enough level but yeah if you're on a high carb diet and you consume I don't know two to three tablespoons of

[01:10:54] MCT how high could you expect your bhp to get there depending on your absorption anywhere between 0.5 to 1 millimolar the hacks high say yeah even on a high yeah if it's pure c8 maybe so with C 8 you get about a twenty maybe thirty percent elevation above like a mix of the c10 CA which is generic there's some work being done that c10 may actually have some beneficial effects I mean that's kind of the idea behind the product ex ona that was on the market you know a while back I don't know if it's still in the market yeah it's a basically c8 it's powdered see that was pure c8 yeah you can I ordered like from Sigma or something like that yeah well I'd Dave Astra's brain octane is caprylic triglyceride and carrillo nutrition makes Captree which is a CA oil so if you buy pure c8 not in triglyceride form caprylic if you just go just straight for like acid yes that'll kill you I mean you you consume that I bought I made the mistake early on and bought from Sigma caprylic acid but not yet you need to buy out really try question that's that mistake before investigate I bought it from Sigma and I think I was going to use it in experiments and we're gonna mix it you know with our rat chow and I wanted to go through a legitimate source and I put a little bit on my finger and it kind of burnt my tongue off and I realized wait a second I think I need to try glyceride form of caprylic acid it's caprylic triglyceride yeah I almost killed myself I don't want a Darwin

[01:12:31] Award yeah you know I never leave any reason I probably did that before I accidentally kills himself yeah have you had any experience with the powdered MCTS yeah yeah so powdered MCTS allow me to increase my ketone levels higher than and I used a quest powdered MCT formula there's a couple in the market now maybe yeah I have that of this stuff at home because I feel like anyone who's ever made a ketone product just somehow figures out my address and sends them to me so I have a pantry full of every type of ketone you can imagine I do too but I haven't yeah you probably get more than me I just haven't got around to trying any of the MCT powder but I'm getting ready to do a long fast in a couple of weeks and I was thinking I really ought to get make sure I'm back in ketosis the week before I deprived myself of food for a week yeah so I was actually just thinking about this last week which is I got a fire up those powdered MCT and kickstart this thing because I don't have like a couple months to get fully adapted yeah they are great I mean MC teas are kind of like the poor man's ketone ester right so they are they're they're found in nature they're versatile you can call them the middle classes man yes given how expensive ketone Esther's harness that's right that's right so I tinkered a lot with MCTS early on and increase my tolerability from maybe 30 milliliters a day to a hundred and fifty milliliters a day that's ridiculous yeah when anytime I went to 30 in one sitting 10 tablespoonfuls yeah yeah that's that's hard to fathom you need to incorporate it with food so I was spreading it what I found I needed to do was instead of doing intermittent fasting now which I pretty much do now I inquire spread it out over like four meals and maybe would have a little bit of MCT in the coffee too and not including that a meal so I was eating a modified ketogenic diet but spreading that MCT out with salad dressings putting it on vegetables and things like that and I was able to because if anybody is listening to this and it's like they're just sitting there thinking how what can I do to do it to have a all prep Shh like yeah the answer is just just just drink MCT yeah you know it's better than fleets phospho soda you will you will spend the day in the bathroom yeah and you'll have a great coffee you can work your way up to it so there's a number of transporters obviously that are upregulated and you are enhancing the breakdown and transport of these fat and MCTS actually do cross the blood-brain barrier so we did studies in rats where we take they're getting an absorbed portal II how do we know oh okay some of them I forget the percentage but

[01:15:15] I think and some people say it's like 50% of MCTS converted to ketones but I think it's something like about 20% of MCTS and it depends on the energetic state of the liver you know which is the master regulator and your your physiology in general but you have a fairly significant portion of the MCTS being converted to ketones but the MCTS do enter the blood and they can cross the blood-brain barrier unlike the long-chain fats and say for example if you take out the hippocampus of rats that are eating an MCT based ketogenic diet you'll find MCT levels are significantly elevated so they're crossing they're getting into the brain and the brain is utilizing MCTS as fuel and do we know if that has any anti-seizure effect independent of the ketone that might be produced alongside it that's a big area of research right now that MCTS is functional fats so and

[01:16:07] I've never heard that term before functional fats yeah like well fats with drug like properties so I think there's a number of patents around c10 actually that I know they have in the UK I think it might be a pharmaceutical now so c10 actually has anti-seizure properties so there's some people argue that the effects of the the ketogenic diet at least with MCTS is not due to ketones but actually due to the MCTS and not the ketones so there's a little bit there's a couple groups out there that are sort of arguing that and I think they have a case but I think it's it's probably a comet definitely combination of the ketones and and the MCT so MCTS do have interesting property do you know

[01:16:50] Elizabeth teal you have awesome children so I remember having breakfast with her about six years ago and asking her a question that at the time I don't think she knew the answer to and she was gracious enough to explain that and she was there with someone else in her lab so it was a very spirited awesome discussion but I wonder if the answer is known today the question was basically do you believe that the anti seizure properties of a ketogenic diet are more the result of the brain having another fuel to displace glucose or due to the reduction in glucose that invariably accompanies ketogenesis and at the time she shared with me very compelling data that would could argue either of those points potentially suggesting it was the combination of them do you have a point of view on this or is there more information today that steers you one way or the other well I know she's done some work with the low glycemic index diet and so so carbohydrate reduction but without the production of ketones yeah so a reduction its carbohydrate restriction but only to the effect that maybe 20 or 25% you know you have level and then carbohydrates that are low glycemic index and what are the results of that intervention for different types of seizures it can have a positive effect and for certain certain types of seizures that's not the first line of therapy for you know very powerful tonic clonic seizures in Pediatrics you want to go right to the classical ketogenic diet but it does have a number of applications for different types of seizure disorders and what about if you take someone on a fully carb diet who's having recalcitrant seizures and you give them ketone exogenous ketone does that have anti seizure benefit yeah so those studies have not been done yet and there's a study being Recruiting right now for something called Angelman syndrome which is a rare genetic disorder that has seizures where the exogenous ketones are the therapy independent of the diet so they're just being added on top of the diet there are people out there because exogenous ketones are commercially available that are using this in place of the ketogenic diet because the families are either unwilling or for various reasons unable to you the ketogenic diet and they you know use are using exogenous ketones and the feedback that I'm getting could be biased but it does seem to have an effect it obviously has an effect in animal models the animal models that we work with we give exhaustion ski tones on top of a standard rat chow which is high carbohydrate chow and it it works very well for CNS oxygen toxicity but also for things like ventolin tetras ol uh seizures pzt seizures even for absence seizures we use a particular animal model with absence seizures or absent seizure it works for that so it works for a variety of different seizure models independent we are circumventing sort of the dietary restriction that's typically associated with getting into therapeutic ketosis and just simply giving exhaustive ketones and elevating exogenous ketones but a consideration is that exogenous ketones lower blood glucose so you have and in some cases it lowers it really low like the high dose ketone esters that we do in our rat models it pushes and rats typically maintain a glucose of around 140 to 150 and it'll push it down to 40 so milligrams per deciliter the maximum tolerable dose of the ketone ester and it's interesting when we go above the maximum tolerable dose we actually see glucose levels spike up and this is a phenomenon that we see it's almost like it's stressing out the liver just regulating the liver in some way it's the data we're trying to figure out but if you titrate in ketone salts or ketone salt

[01:20:45] MCT combination or various ketone esters it's inversely proportional to as you elevate ketones you have a very predictable reliable decrease in blood glucose that's above and beyond the decrease in blood glucose that you'd observe with something like metformin and we use metformin for many many studies in a lab and we have a lot of experience so what do we think you know it's funny I was up in San Francisco like a month ago and I was talking with

[01:21:13] Steve Finney who you know at the outset I said you're one of the people who I would say knows more about ketosis than anyone alive and and certainly Steve would have to be in that category so I would if I were gonna just guess I would say sure between you and Steve Finney if the answer isn't really known on ketosis the answer might not be known yeah so but and Steve and I were having this really fun discussion with a few other folks about why is it that the ketones are driving down the glucose levels and conversely and maybe this is a different question of course but why is it that when we do these experiments of you take somebody in nutritional ketosis and you make them do really really aggressive exercise you know do a two-minute all-out effort on the rowing machine that the ketones go way down and the glucose goes way up is it solely a consumption and hepatic glucose output issue is there something else going on you know and and I was like well I kind of always assumed that we knew the answer to that and that it was the explanation I had but you know it wasn't it at the end of that discussion I was like actually I pretty much now don't think I know the answer to this question

[01:22:17] I don't think we do I have three potential explanations one could be an exogenous ketone induced release and insulin that facilitates glucose disposal so that happens you do get I mean it's not like consuming a protein bolus or a carbohydrate bolus but you do get an elevation of ketones that's right that's how we moderate our ketone levels right so as our ketone levels if we're on the ketogenic diet and our ketones become elevated there's ketonuria we pee out some ketones and there's a number of but one is a ketone induced release of insulin which then feeds back on the liver to like a rheostat really and and lowering bit oxygen which totally makes sense because that's the reason that's one key to type one diabetes can get ketoacidosis they they lose the checkpoint yep yep and other researchers like if you asked Richard beech you'll tell you that insulin sensitivity is increased so the insulin that you have available and associated signaling is being enhanced in the presence of ketones so is that an immediate change or is that a change that takes place over a long period of time that that sounds like a long-standing issue I think there's a number of regulatory things that happen in his study where rats were fed standard rodent chow but 30 to 20 percent ketone Esther I think within that Chow their baseline insulin levels went down like 50 percent so that's just simply by you know just the addition of via tome just the addition of the ketone over time over I think it was like it may be a three week I got a look to see the study but it was it was consuming ketone Esther that was integrated into the rat chow over a number of weeks decreased baseline levels of insulin significantly I mean it was like a huge effect and the implications of that you know as a rat study you know you can argue rat study but I can tell you experimentally that are just you know testing on myself that the same observation happens I can actually if I get a significant amount of my calories from exhaustive ketones and I do that over several weeks and I measure my insulin it gets below the reference range whereas if I get back to a regular ketogenic diet I'm always on the low end of the reference range but I did find if

[01:24:38] I consume the maximum tolerable dose of a ketone ester or ketone salt and then I measure insulin you know an hour to after that I do get a little bump up in insulin but it's nowhere near the bump I would get up if I ate an equivalent amount of calories from protein or carbohydrates which would shoot me up to like you know eight or ten or something like that you know with a big dose but it's usually somewhere around I bump it up from like 1.5 to like 2.5 or 3 or something like that those are still super yeah and that's my baseline and usually between one and two so is your IGF level changed in the years that you've been on ketosis have you tracked it much

[01:25:15] I have not I've gotten it measured a few times but not not reliably like I do insulin quite often like every every two months or so like I'm doing that and if I'm doing an experiment I may do multiple measurements of insulin like throughout the week but I haven't measured igf-1 recently I did a while back and I was just in the normal range but I wasn't fasting

[01:25:35] I didn't that's the one variable I wish I would have tried insulin was oh so i can assume igf-1 yeah so just for listeners and stuff how do we measure ketones I mean people talk about urine strips versus blood what are you measuring in each and breath for that matter you've got three ways to theoretically measure these things which one do we prefer and why for a new beginning into this I think the urine ketone strips will at least tell you if you're in ketosis or not in ketosis what is it measuring it's measuring on it and what does it tell you you're in acetyl acetate is measured and now there's a urine beta-hydroxybutyrate kits that are available so you could do that so the abbott labs precision extra and the keto mojo are two devices that will measure basically an assay a home assay kit for beta-hydroxybutyrate and we have used both of those things and and kind of measured it against various assays in the lab and and blood that we send out for analysis and it's pretty close pretty close plus or minus maybe ten or fifteen percent what does the urinary level even though it's a qualitative assay but you know everybody says hey my urinary ketone thing lit up right purple can we infer anything from that about the blood level of PHP or acetoacetate usually you know unless you're running kind of dehydrated you know if you have a normal hydration state and your urine acetoacetate is 40 milligrams per deciliter or above you are probably hitting 1 millimolar or above if you're anywhere between 40 and 80 - I think 160 milligrams per deciliter so you're in a state of ketosis I would if you're a 15 that's like light pink or something you're usually probably not in a state what I would say keto that might be a normal state if you wake up in the morning in sort of a fasted state you might be hitting that but generally speaking you need to be at about 80 milligrams per deciliter on the urine ketone stretch and the one thing I didn't do rather when I was doing my sort of long foray into ketosis is I didn't use the urine meters at all I was just you know I was yeah I was keeping

[01:27:45] Abbott in business basically but how many of those precision extras trips I was going through so I don't know if my urinary excretion actually declined over time when my body became better and better at retaining this potentially preferred fuel have you done anything on that either personally or in the lab so what we use in the lab is the clinic Tech's status device and that device takes the Siemens 10 s G kit so the multi stick so you can buy for a similar cost as the keto stick you could buy the Siemens 10 SG multi stick and that measures 10 things including urine acetyl acetate and you could take that you're in strip and stick that in a device that will give you more of a quantified number I see so that's how you were giving me quantitative information on the UI because I've only seen the qualitative stuff well it's a color change on the strip that's measured right yeah so over the years I rejected urine ketone strips is something that just wasn't very accurate and the more I use them making hundreds if not thousands of measurements the more I gain an appreciation that it can be a pretty useful device but I think it's it's kind of useful for the individual your hydration status definitely changes it I mean been in situations where I'm dehydrated where

[01:29:10] I've come out of the water after like a six hour dive and I've peed in on those things and it's like it's like screaming and I knew I mean I did some diets where I purposely wasn't in ketosis for some of the research that we do and I was deep into in taquitos just because I was you know very very dehydrated I didn't know someone could dive for six hours I was on the NASA Nemo extreme environment

[01:29:33] Mission Operations trip so I was a crew member on that where I maintained I was lived in saturation for ten days in a hyperbaric environment and that involves like an 18 19 hour decompression to come out it's a NASA sort of a Mars analog mission where you work with astronauts underneath the sea and I maintain the state of ketosis throughout that whole mission and and did lots of lots of measurements myself down there and I saw really when I one time I got out after maybe it was a six-hour a VA so essentially you're hyperbaric habitat on the bottom of the ocean and then you go out into the water and then you come back inside the hyperbaric habitat but when you're out in the water even though you're down in the keys the water water pulls heat from you like 200 times faster than air so even though it's like you know upper 80s

[01:30:27] I come out of that hypothermic and dehydrated my blood glucose always was in like the 30s sometimes in the 40s when I was on Nikita I was testing some of the ketone supplements Wow what were the other people experiencing under those circumstances well we'll find out with this my wife actually is a was selected as a crew member for NASA and you know 23 I was on 22 and I did not get the IRB protocol approved to do all the metabolic studies that I wanted to do but I became an n of one on that and I collected a lot of data on myself so with this new mission we have the

[01:31:07] Nemo NASA Nemo 23 we'll be able to make some pretty comprehensive metabolic measurements including things like hemoglobin h 1c we're going to measure inflammation H s CRP glucose ketones all these things on all the crewmembers interestingly this year it's a it's an all-female crew so you have like Samantha Christopher Eddie the famous

[01:31:29] European Tracy Caldwell Dyson who I've known at NASA and my wife and it's all female so we'll have love some female data to go along with this what surprised you the most in your end of one what did you see that you'd least expected I saw why predicted that the habitat would really trigger inflammation that was probably from the elevated co2 levels and the elevated oxidative stress I chose to stay in a state of ketosis with the idea that that was my baseline state we're doing

[01:32:02] Studies on sleep we're using the oral ring you're probably familiar with that on sleep and and also the polar V 800 to collect heart rate variability data gut microbiome we're doing body composition measurements we're doing stress so we use the NIH toolbox and to look at cognitive psych parameters so that data has not been shared to me so I don't know my wife collected some of that data and that's being analyzed you know later on for publication but from a metabolic perspective from a hormone perspective some of the things living in that environment for 10 days decrease my testosterone unless I had a 25% decrease in testosterone from the time and so we're fairly may be fairly sleep-deprived I average about 6 hours of sleep per night but I was getting like 2 and a half hours of deep sleep which is more deep sleep very typically yeah I was like I don't know if it's a it's simply an artifact of how the sleep is being estimated in other ways you know if you think you're assuming you're giving that off the aura ring right yeah that was also the aura ring is measuring but I usually get about 90 minutes sometimes like last year last night I got one hour and 53 minutes of deep sleep but I usually get about one out one and a half hours of deep sleep but I got over two hours every night and instead of seven hours sleep at night I was getting consistently just you know five to six hours sleep at night so where are you gonna be shortchanged on

[01:33:29] REM yeah but my REM was even not that bad I was getting about an hour you know an hour around which is not as much yeah usually two is optimal for me I think so yeah we measured sleep the things that really stood out were being in the water really pushes my body into and being hypothermic really turns me into a fat-burning machine my ketones go off the chart and my glucose goes way down and almost looks like a six-hour evie a when I came back into the habitat look like I fasted for a week so I have all that data for that two that I need to compile and now should we be looking at that we meaning people as a potential way to replicate fast under a more stressful state looking at what just underwater he do you think it was a combination of temperature and pressure primarily that was driving that effect so over the holidays we went to Thailand and we did I did a lot of nitrox dives something like thirty nitrox dives and I made these measurements too and I did see trends decrease glucose and nitrox dyes were doing like an hour maybe hour hour-and-a-half diets at the most and I saw trans but nothing like the trends I saw in the saturation environment when we did these long EPA's so do you think that the temperature was that pretty sure the temperature really has to have a difference because you come out and you're kind of shaky you know even though you feel very comfy when you're down there the first two or three hours and then by the end the last you know four or five six hours for a longer evie a you start like shaking a little bit uncontrollably you know but it's kind of subtle even though the water is kind of warm like it feels warm but it's just you know your body temperature is going down and they were on the days maybe I wasn't getting as much calories as I as

[01:35:20] I needed I came out of that mission lighter than I've ever been before I came out when we got back to mainland and I stepped on the scale I was 207 which is super low for me I ended up losing about maybe I went in kind of late because I was training for it I'm not a very good swimmer like you I had the really train to meet like you it would be like a total day in the park for you to to meet all the criteria for that but I had to train really hard to meet the swim requirements so I ended up losing a little bit of weight but when I came out I would definitely rejuvenation

[01:35:55] I lost nine pounds and it came out seven so I went in 216 so I went in pretty late I'm like 2 21 now so last year I entered the mission at 216 and I came out like 207 which was like I thought the scale was wrong so even though I ate a lot of calories during that mission metabolic yeah my metabolic rate was really high you know and that that was a consequence of that is so interesting because it's those are two completely contradictory concepts to me on the one hand you're saying hey my glucose levels went down my ketone levels went up it looked like I had fasted for a week yep but of course if you fasted for a week your metabolic rate would be going down and not up in fact you would expect to see at ah Fiji skyrocket whereas I'm sitting here as I'm listening to you thinking would at hoffa G have increased during that period of time or decreased

[01:36:44] I think anything that pushes glucose lo and Ketones that hi and I think not really without knowing it we're pretty task loaded so you don't have all the time you know that much time to eat I mean part of the mission is that they're training this is part of its the only NASA analog where astronauts are actually part of the crew members like other things like hi-seas mission or

[01:37:08] NASA hero mission actually uses everyday folks and they push them to the limits and see how they they can break them but the NASA Nemo mission is actually training sort of astronauts so they task load you to see what you're doing and you don't have a whole lot of time to eat but I was I was consuming what my normal calories would be but I was under

[01:37:26] I underestimated my calories for this and I think it put me in a calorie deficit which probably decreased my testosterone may have a cortisol level increase but it was still within the normal range and you're away from the light so your circadian is probably a bit screwed up to being whatever so you have you're only it's like sixty feet so you do see some of the light come down and but uh but it's probably a little bit different than I'm a very light sort of Sun worshiper like I always try to get some light in the middle you know in the beginning of the day and that that's part of something that I always do so it was a bit disruptive in that sense so let's talk about key tone esters salts etc so to your knowledge what's the first exogenous ketone that was ever manufactured is that vitaly one or exogenous ketone manufactured so one three butanediol has been around a long time since the 1950s actually MIT did some research as a space fuel so they kept there was a publication in 1975 where they were trying to identify an alternative energy fuel for long-duration spaceflight and the best candidate was one three butanediol which is sort of a synthetic compound that breaks down completely to beta-hydroxybutyrate meaning the liver is not required to transform it into bhp the liver is required yeah through a couple simple steps so sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate would be the first sort of ketone exotica ketone that was clinically and there was a number of papers that utilized that for rare metabolic disorders actually so that would be the first one and a lot of the

[01:39:10] IP and you know sort of patents that came out or sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate and then maybe explain for people what the difference is between a salt and an ester so we'll leave acetoacetate out of that for a moment yeah but if you talk about beta-hydroxybutyrate but you can have a COS state salt too so

[01:39:27] I can mention that so I didn't know that I thought it was only a digester so that's what we want to hear about that so on the b HB front people are sort of inundated with ketone salts ketone esters and then a whole bunch of complete like weird stuff like raspberry ketones and stuff but yeah let's just leave the nonsense off the table yeah but if you just talk about comparing a ketone a b HB ester to a b HB salt what's the chemical difference yeah so a salt is just an ionic bond right between the ketone molecule and beta-hydroxybutyrate a mono valent or a divalent cation or an alkaline amino acid like arginine citrulline histidine lysine so you can literally ionically bonded hydroxy butyrate to a number of different things the easiest thing to do is to bond it with sodium potassium calcium and magnesium now calcium and magnesium have two positive charges you could put a ph

[01:40:20] PS on them that's the advantage sort of an advantage a disadvantage I guess with magnesium BHB which is actually is very bioavailable magnesium I measured my magnesium after taking it went up quite quite high disadvantage is that your GI taller ability to something like magnesium beta-hydroxybutyrate maybe only somewhere between 1 to 3 grams you know 3 grams max per dose not that much one gram three times a day at least for me had no issues I could probably tolerate 2 or 3 grams per day so it's nice I mean it's something that's contributing but ideally what you want to do with a ketone salt is because salt has a stigma I call them ketone electrolyte formulations do is to spread the beta-hydroxybutyrate out across mono valent and divalent cations and they're the four that have the most utility and then an ester of course is a covalent bond not an ionic bond right yeah so you can take one three butanediol and you could create a mono ester with beta hydroxy butyrate right and just add it do a trans esterification reaction and combine that beta hydroxy butyrate to 1:3 butanediol or acetoacetate you can combine two with 1:3 region or you could take glycerol so with glycerol you can come up with a tri astir of glycerol which we have basically you're creating a triglyceride that is instead of three fatty acids you have a 3b hp's it's pretty cool molecule yeah so we have some experience using anything that so yeah I told a story like many many years ago twenty four five years ago on Tim Ferriss his podcast about how I drank this jet fuel and almost yeah I thought I was gonna go blind of course what I may have what I may or may not have emitted from that story was that you gave it to me the ketones today taste a heck of a lot better than that earlier gen stuff yeah and I even when I told you that I just took the 50 ml vial you sent and chugged it in one sitting even you were sort of horrified like wait wait you didn't read the note I wrote you explaining how to dilute it and mix it we had talked about it we had assuredly talked about very you're very enthusiastic about getting started yeah yeah I couldn't resist I was too sad that stuff's unbearably bad yeah so what I mean whereas the ketone salts actually don't taste bad there yeah awesome yeah yeah so why does the ester is there an obvious reason from an olfactory slash taste perspective why they are so staggeringly horrible yeah at least they were and I mean I'm told they're better today yeah I would say the ketogenic potency is inversely proportional to taste so it just seems like you know the more the more potent these compounds get even the the try astir of beta hydroxy butyrate they you know is pretty nasty stuff meaning that glycerol triglyceride that yeah it's a great molecule I mean it has like lots of you know tremendous utility well making a ketone ester with 1 3 butanediol is really cool because the one 3 butanediol is more substrate broken down yeah so that goes into another question the whole enantiomer so if you use the are beta-hydroxybutyrate with the r-13 butanediol then you can really get ketone levels up pretty high and that would be sort of the Delta G or the human you know ketone ester that's out there it's the R and enter that would be the our yeah the our it's our what so you have you can get racemic one three butanediol but that's the our enantiomer of one three butanediol with the our beta hydroxy we explain to everybody what our versus L means in the yeah and antemer world so beta-hydroxybutyrate not a sido acetate but beta hydroxy butyrate has a stereoisomer so if you put your hands together the our beta hydroxy butyrate or let's do D and L let's do that so the D would be equivalent to the our beta hydroxy butyrate would be the mirror image of the L beta hydroxy butyrate and the predominant form of beta hydroxy butyrate in the body is d beta hydroxy butyrate we do have a rasa maize enzyme that in various tissues that can convert the D to the L so but when you're in nutritional ketosis or starvation ketosis ketosis you were making D and antemer of the BH be predominantly yeah so we do have the capacity to make the L but it's it's pretty pretty minimal so that brings up the question I think 99% of all the ketone salts being sold right now are racemic so they are the D and the L when you give cool yeah yeah they're equal amount and there may be a concern there but we don't know so most of my research has actually been with the racemic compounds and they work great therapeutically in pharmacology there's a sordid history of getting the enantiomer wrong I mean one of the things one of the stories I know of his fortified yeah what I might as well yeah so so that's right falooda might and fen phen were both examples of using the wrong and antemer many pharmaceuticals like I think ibuprofen and you know like a Fed Rin you know is is racemic and many of the drugs out there so and things like ringers lactate I think you know lactate is it is is it D now it used to be racemic oh really thank you I think I think you can get both okay so you're saying look physiologically exist at 90 10 d2l and then you're buying something racemic you at least have to entertain the question hey am i ingesting something that might have a negative side effect yeah and so the ketone esters there they're mirroring the physiology they're just going mostly D presumably well the human ketone ester for my understanding is completely D so it's produced - D beta-hydroxybutyrate interestingly elevating just beta-hydroxybutyrate in our seizure models even with the D does not have an anti seizure effect so that's actually why we went to the 1/3 butanediol sorry say that again do you say that if you use a pure D salt a D salt or DD ester or DC or pure de ester no anti seizure man ty seizure effect with beta-hydroxybutyrate we need it and the animal models even suggest this if you just look even studies beyond our study is that you need to elevate acetyl acetate has the anti seizure effect and we don't know exactly why that happens the ketone ester that we work with which is 1/3 butanediol acetoacetate diaster elevates beta-hydroxybutyrate an acetyl acetate in approximately 1 ratio that what you used to give me or was I just kidding I gave you a bunch of things it was the one Apple that tasted even worse than the BH ester actually that yeah that was the digester of acetoacetate yeah and that's really potent and it was bound to what it won through unit oil yeah that was from another planet bad I still have some because I've done shots of that I like to just get I put many gallons of that through me and done quite a bit of blood work and and know pretty reliably at least in my body that it's not toxic and pretty much all the biomarkers go in a remarkably positive direction but even though I know that it's not enough for me to to even know it has that and that's no matter how great substance can be if it doesn't taste good you know even me I'm not gonna take it you know even I can I just think exactly well I also remember you telling me because you sent them and I was like oh sweet it'll be capsules cuz I had seen your animal data and I was like I want that and then you said okay well

[01:48:04] I'll send that you in capsules cuz you can't drink it it's too bad and I was like perfect situation resolved and you said and not entirely yet you'll still taste it through the capsule yeah and I actually find it to be a great dinner party trick like like who's the biggest you know tough guy here that just wants to show me how much of this stuff they can ingest yeah yeah I mean we've done a lot of work with that Esther and it has remarkable effects but we think it's probably more suited for like a medical food and something that could be sort of a parenteral you know IV therapy so hoofers will synthesize that so I reached out to honoree Bruning grabber

[01:48:44] Case Western who was a director of the metabolomics NIH funded I think metabolomic score at Case Western and I reached out to everybody but who had any experience you know either researching with ketone esters or synthesizing them and he kindly gave me the recipe on how to synthesize it that was above and beyond the patent it was actually a detailed recipe on how to use a kugel

[01:49:11] Road distillation apparatus where to get the value you didn't already know how to do that I knew she passed it well actually so Patrick Arnold as you know kind of helped me with the art so an organic chemistry really is an art you know to be able to do this Patrick is an artist Patrick is an artist and he was he thought this was like shady stuff in the beginning and I kept sending him papers and and then he realized that this could be something big you know he realized that the science was there and there was a lot of big players in this field who had done remarkable research but just didn't really have what it took to like actually make it a product like synthesize it in the stuff that you actually consume I became obsessed with

[01:49:55] Patrick after yeah that stuff happened yeah he actually introduced him to Tim I'm in the show notes to this I'll make sure that we link to hymns podcast with Patrick Patrick which I'd love to have Patrick on the show at some point too to talk about the whole should this show end up persisting but that episode with Tim and Patrick is so interesting it's like if you have any interest in endocrinology in sort of like how the hormones work how steroids work it's yeah yeah this is what I character I owe a lot to Patrick I don't think I probably wouldn't have gotten tenure without bio so much to him so I need to acknowledge him for that that there were academic icons out there who could not do what Patrick did for me and he was pretty persistent in doing it do so he synthesized first the mono ester and then it was a mixed of mono Esther and diaster but he nailed it down to you know ultimately getting the art at the organic chemistry to where it's pretty much pure digester he's such a such a wonderful human being any time I email

[01:51:01] Patrick a question which invariably I do have like clinically I'll have a question about a hormone or they'll be like there's no textbook that knows the answer there's no paper that knows the answer I'm like Patrick I got a crazy question for you and it's like even if he doesn't know the answer I mean he'll have a more thoughtful insight than yeah and get anywhere and it's yeah it speaks to his capabilities so first of all you've shared with me something I didn't actually know today that's really interesting which is this notion that if you are purely using the D and antemer you do not get any of the anti-seizure benefits whereas if you're a 90/10 presumably you're getting them so you don't need a lot of the L but you need some of L yeah I don't think there's any studies that show using a Janus ketone in the form of pure beta hydroxy butyrate is beneficial so what we do know is that when you deliver exogenous ketones in a beta hydroxy butyrate to acetoacetate ratio of one to one that that has pretty remarkable anti-seizure effects and there was some studies that were done with acetyl acetate and also some studies that we're done with acetone showing anti-seizure effects so

[01:52:07] I do think it's acetyl acetate is necessary so what we don't know I don't think that racemic or racemic esters or esters that produce both D and L beta-hydroxybutyrate are a concern I have not seen data to suggest that these would be a health concern there are companies out there that are selling eight million sort of doses per month of salts that are racemic in nature and there have been sort of no consequences from that that have been reported so how are so many companies able to do this is there no IP in the salt world anymore I don't think there is IP for the key I think some of the early patents may expired so I don't think there's actually there's there's some intellectual property with formulations of a ketone salt and a ketogenic fat and MCT and that's some of the stuff that my university has and there's some composition of matter patents and maybe some use patents around the D salts I think and maybe the

[01:53:12] D ketone esters so at this point in time do you think that the ketone salts have more physiologic benefit than the ketone esters just as a function of having a higher amount of the L and antemer so I think when it comes to purely a metabolic fuel I think the D beta hydroxy butyrate has some advantages right so we also know that in regards to some of the signaling effects especially the inflammation the nlrp3 inflammasome is suppressed by beta hydroxy butyrate both the D and the L form and we know that when we consume racemic ketone salts in the dnl form the L form tends to stick around longer and gets metabolized slower so conceivably that could be having a stronger anti-inflammatory effect because you have a ketone body an endogenous metabolite that's functioning as a very powerful signaling molecule that's suppressing an inflammatory pathway so the concentration just tends to get hired you know that that's my view of it so we haven't really studied that in detail but the lab that did some of the work on showing the nature medicine paper that showed the nlrp3 inflammasome was pressed by beta-hydroxybutyrate it occurred both in the D in the L form we do know that the L form gets metabolized slower so the the concentrations and the tissue may actually reach higher levels so what we have observed is that the racemic beta-hydroxybutyrate has a glucose lowering effect so we're trying to figure out the exact we also see that in the pure and the DT tumor yeah I've seen that with the human product which yes obviously a pure d yep pH be I think they're seeing about a twenty to thirty percent reduction in glucose do you see them or in the racemic it tends to be the case yeah it tends to be the case especially with one three butanediol you say it and maybe it's a redox shift in the liver that's what honorary Bruning grabar thought but it's pretty remarkable and when we compare so I have some products in my bag I'll give you I have I've been doing a lot of work with D salts so I've been consuming D salts and pretty high levels that bring my ketone levels up pretty close to an ester so you can formulate sort of in uses how high if the elevation of my ketones gets more than 3 milli molar I just start feeling a little bit weird you know which is interesting because you've experienced naturally-occurring ketones at much higher than that level yeah but I don't actually I'm a pretty good ketone burner so you could do a glucose tolerance test

[01:55:55] I do a ketone tolerance test the ketone tolerance test is consuming a known amount of ketones and looking at that pharmacokinetic curve so you measure so you'll do fasting level of BM glucose insulin fatty acid ingest your ketone and then measure at 30 60 90 120 minutes and athletes have challenged them with a ketone tolerance test I'm creating like a new test here they actually dispose of ketones and utilize it remarkably affect a cat couch potato and this the same as the couch potato rats you could push a couch potato rat into ketoacidosis if they're older their tissues are not effectively utilizing the ketones for fuel and I've seen that in some individuals and some people I get hundreds of emails and people show me their data and one packet of even a commercial ketone product on the market can shoot some people up to like five or six which is like that just isn't clear in that ketone tolerance test which by the way I freaking love this idea how have you not told me that until today holding out on your best it's just materialized in my brain what am I going to call it you know it is just pick up the phone you know my number you call me and you tell me this stuff this is your it's like you're holding out on me I just kidding

[01:57:12] I want to make sure I understand something is this independent of whether or not that athlete was in ketosis before or after in other words how much of that utilization is a function of the metabolic machinery in the muscle to utilize ketone versus hey athletes are just better at oxidation to begin with fat adapted athletes are very good ketone utilizers and have a hard time elevating their ketone levels with the ketogenic diets um if you take our bath lete who's still fit as a fiddle yep and you do this test yep how do they behave not as well and I do think that high-performing athletes probably are bouncing in and out of ketosis right you have post-exercise ketosis just from the energy depletion that you get during exercise so their bodies are probably used to seeing ketones using them as fuel but if you take someone who's a real keto adapted fat burning like ketone machine and you you hit them with high doses of ketones they tend to dispose of them very very quickly so they've up regulated ketone transport across membranes across the blood-brain barrier through the MCT transporters which are upregulated we notice of course is your not the same MCT that we talked about these are mono carboxylic acid transporters but also transport things like lactate and pyruvate and because the MCT transporters are much higher and more dense in the membrane you could probably clear lactate faster so i think that may contribute in part to why keto adapted athletes produce less lactate it's funny you say that I hadn't thought of that actually I didn't realize that in ketosis you up regulate

[01:58:46] MCT I've always suspected that that might play a role in the genetic differences between athletes why do some athletes seem virtually unparalleled by an aerobic activity and it's like look if you can shuttle lactate out of the cell quick enough you can recycle it and reuse it we actually tried to get an IRB of an N of 1 again I'm Ryan Flaherty whoo I don't know if you know Ryan you know of him yeah so so Ryan and I and and a couple of other guys tried to get an N of 1 IRB at UCSD to do muscle biopsies on ourselves pre and post a certain type of nutrition exercise routine we wanted to implement that Ryan has sort of pioneered with with a number of endurance athletes and that was our that was one of our end points was could we see an upregulation of MCT because the hypothesis was the certain type of training stress was going to was gonna lead to that which would obviously increase our performance at a certain level of output but super interesting to think about that through the level of the ketone potentially enhancing that signaling yeah it is a lot of things to think about there so many caveat my next question with a really serious caveat but it's also a very serious question and I was sort of on the fence about whether I'd asked you this or not but I

[02:00:01] I'm gonna say screw it I'm gonna ask you anyway I'm gonna caveat this by giving the disclaimer which is your PhD scientist you do basic research you are not an MD you are not an oncologist and nothing you say is going to be construed as medical advice so with that said I still have to ask you a question which is if tomorrow you your wife someone you cared about deeply was diagnosed with cancer and it was a cancer for which all standard therapies had been exhausted and you were now left to the best insights you have with respect to your knowledge of cancer metabolism tell me what pulling out all the stops looks like and again what I'm this is in the context of you've taken and you are complying with all chemo therapeutic radiation therapy hormonal therapy surgical therapy etc but you're losing right so something else needs to be done what what is that combination of that something look like so I guess I mean when we think about the worst cancer worst case scenario who of pancreatic sprit II bad but probably glioblastoma would top the list of things right and would your answer be different if I was asking you about pancreatic adenocarcinoma versus GBM I think you know it would be there's things like with pancreatic cancer can make it hard for someone to follow the ketogenic diet right cuz and and liver cancer and things like that so they need to approach it a little bit different and you can have a lot of unexpected consequences metabolic consequences by someone with liver cancer if they have heavy liver Mets so let's make it cement brain cancers let's talk about GBM and metastatic breast cancer okay okay so start with GBM your loved one or you have GBM yeah I would say it would be useful not necessarily you know absolutely necessary to ask for an fdg-pet scan and do a PET CT especially

[02:01:51] I mean with GBM it's gonna light up like there's no tomorrow right so just for the listener so fdg-pet means you take glucose you label glucose with a molecule yeah and then when you do the PET scan shows by lighting up anything that absorbs that and the most rapidly metabolizing tissues of glucose light that up which is almost always any cancer and then a brain normally lights up so a brain with cancer takes that to another level yeah so you're doing that to document that this is a high glycolytic tumor yeah okay so even now there's a lot of experimental things going on for GBM but pretty much the standard of care is not offering any survival advantage when it comes to this so we did GBM is uniformly fatal

[02:02:33] I believe the five the five-year survival is almost zero yeah yep and the mutation rate in GBM is it's but they're very very heterogeneous in regards to the number of mutations so many of the standard of care therapies that target specific pathways just are not efficacious because you have a grossly mutated cells throughout the tumor so

[02:02:59] I'd probably my answer would default back to this press pulse idea that we published in nutrition and metabolism is that the one we 2017 no actually so the 2017 paper was in seminars and cancer and that was with oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center where we discuss how the ketogenic diet essentially targets the Warburg effect and in doing so really targets all the hallmarks of cancer so any cancer biologists you know is writing a review on paper like you know you talk about the hallmarks of cancer there's enhanced proliferation evasion of immune system angiogenesis all these different things evasion of apoptosis the ketogenic diet nutritional ketosis actually targets all those things and even the aberrant metabolism and the increase in inflammation that it's you know is now a hallmark of cancer so from the pressed pulse that the simplest way to describe a at least its implementation which i think is probably most important for the listeners is to achieve a glucose ketone index so press essentially means you were providing metabolic stress to the cancer cells that can stop their rapid growth and Paulo for a shin it's like taking the your foot off the gas pedal of cancer cell growth and there's a number of things that we could do to slow down cancer growth in proliferation and metabolically stress those cancer cells and that can be done continuously and pulse protocols you have a wide expanding toolbox of modalities that can be used in an intermittent fashion that can be sort of tactically used at different time points to kill off the cancer cells that you have applied the press stress to so press protocols which are done continuously would be something like a calorie restricted ketogenic diet perhaps with intermittent fasting perhaps a low-dose metformin and what was the ketone to glucose ratios you want to see I would want to see anywhere between a maintenance of one to two meaning that's the glucose to ketone right daily maintenance at one to two yeah so so glucose should never be more than twice the ketone level when are measured in millimeters Eaton's three millimolar glucose so that's kind of hard to achieve but not it's not with a number of tools so there's a number of tools that you can use to achieve that and that needs to and there are things that we could talk about to it so the fastest way to get to a glucose ketone index of and maintain that of one to two would be what I would call supplemented ketogenic intermittent fasting right so when you eat within a restricted time window say of like six hours a day you start eating at you know 2 p.m. and finish at a p.m. seems relatively easy to do and within that fasting window if needed you could consume calories in the form of perhaps exogenous ketones and that would further lower glucose and elevate ketone levels like within a range and they are commercially available ketone products on the market millions are being consumed and there's no kind of adverse effects you know when you compare it to something like a redbull which you'll find lots of adverse effects so there's fairly good safety data but this needs to be the difference is redbull sponsors a Formula

[02:06:37] One team so it's exist yeah so these things are relatively safe and their utility are that you know they can help you achieve a glucose ketone index and when you do have a glucose can ketone index of one to two you are limiting fermentable fuels to the cancer cells and also most likely suppressing the hormone insulin tremendously to get there and and because I'm sure you'll be asked or I'll be asked is the reason you are applying an intermittent or time restricted feeding algorithm to this because during the fasted time you increase ketogenesis or because there was something specific about having complete liver and gut rest in other words is there a reason that an individual should or should not consume exogenously tones and/or MCT during the fasting window yeah I think if it's difficult for them to achieve a glucose ketone index of one to two one of the tools in the toolbox could be to consume exogenous ketones during that fasting period I think it can be helped and you can also consume them during the feeding period too and they provide an extra source of calories that's a non fermentable fuel and I think have a benefits in and of itself you could just talk about the anti-inflammatory benefits you know I think there's a number of different so that breast protocol is pretty aggressive yeah and and they could also things like meditation and yoga I mean and exercise of course low intensity exercise I think but the most important thing from my perspective of the press so we're just talking about the press is to get that glucose ketone index to order one or better or one yeah yeah one to two are better and then once that is achieved or concurrently so you could think about different modalities for the pulse protocol so changing your metabolic physiology with what we just described will have a huge effect on targeting the

[02:08:35] Warburg effect and also will be already targeting all the hallmarks of cancer so you have a different person you have just changed that person's metabolism you know I mean the glucose ketone index of the average Joe out on the street is probably less something like 25 or 50 it's like nowhere near that right right so you are literally changing the metabolic physiology of that person so modalities that they may be resistant to or completely failed may have an effect now so chemo radiation may be immune bates therapies may be working now that's an important point right we view this as an as an agile so you could do a neoadjuvant concurrent or adjuvant approach so and I think that what I just described can be used as a neoadjuvant concurrent and an adjuvant approach yeah so people talk about cancer approaches as look you you want to think about the legs of a stool so you take a chemotherapeutic approach you take a radiation approach you take an immune based approach and you take a surgical approach those are really the four pillars of cancer treatment today yeah you're basically saying look there needs to be a new type of oncologist which is the metabolic oncologist so you have a surgical oncologist absolutely for radiation oncologist you have a medical oncologist you know have you know oncologist why don't we have a metabolic oncologist yeah things will lead that way and just by the research that's being done now the huge amount of of research being done even on uncle metabolites and all the genetics people are now focusing on the how metabolism is influencing genetics metabolism is a driver for our biology and influencing epigenetic expression so you know the work I'd like to also point to the work of a friend of mine and colleague Adrian check who is did her work at the Barrow

[02:10:22] Neurological Institute which demonstrated in a mouse model GL 261 I think model of glioblastoma that using temozolomide and also radiation with really focusing on radiation that being in a state of nutritional ketosis made radiation therapy many many times more efficacious in that mouse model which is kind of a gold standard model for GBM it actually cured the GBM in that mouse model using the ketogenic diet combined with whole brain radiation so that was a pretty significant finding that actually spearheaded some of the ketogenic diet clinical research research this was done with dietary or nutritional ketosis not exogenously mentation not does she went on to do some work with exhaustion ketones and looking at how ketones can reprogram the metabolism and ketones can actually have they are like cox-2 inhibitors they inhibit reactive oxygen species which is driving growth and proliferation so that work spawned research just on ketones by themselves in her animal model so what is in your pulse protocol then pulse protocol can be varied so hyperbaric oxygen therapy at what frequency 3 generally speaking so with GBM you have to sew a consequence of a GBM could be seizures right so getting hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a GBM is really tricky so yes you have to start very low probably like somewhere around 1.5 ata and then gradually from there based on the individual person but generally speaking the research that we did showed that not five days a week which is typically used for wound healing but I do think there needs to be a day off for adaptive effects to happen so three days a week 2.5 atmospheres for 60 minutes three times a week and that produces will reverse tumour hypoxia for one thing so hyperbaric oxygen increases tissue oxygenation not by hyper oxygenating hemoglobin but it actually gets oxygen into the plasma and that's a very important thing because meaning you soluble eyes oxygen within the plasma yes because you can't really super saturate the hemoglobin that remember the top of the curve yeah you and I are sitting here

[02:12:53] I don't know this air here but has your your hemoglobin is essentially saturated you know probably 96 98 percent but the hyper oxygenation that occurs with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and this is why oxygen therapy does not work independent of an increase in pressure right so the increase in pressure is needed to drive the oxygen into the plasma and once it's in the plasma tumors have erratic vasculature right and then the bread blood cells get caught inside the capillaries and the basket and the oxygen doesn't get into the tissue inside the tumor but if the oxygen is in the plasma it can get passed and all into the nooks and crannies of the tumor and then reverse tumor hypoxia which is tumor hypoxia is driving hip 1-alpha and veg F and causing so ironically you're taking something that is initially a deficit of cancer which is it's hypoxia but then it utilizes it as it's an advantage by saying hey I'm gonna work around this it's gonna make me more resilient it's gonna allow me to increase my vasculature boom you're saying hey buddy then a little advantage you had that was a disadvantage we're gonna reverse it we're gonna hyper oxygenate you now we're gonna take away your hypoxia and it also includes free radicals yes so you have a dual effect right so you are silencing the oncogenes you're turning off some of the oncogenes and also by hyper oxygenating a tumor which it's baseline is to be in a in a state of hypoxia by super saturating the tumor with oxygen and that tumor tissue has damaged mitochondria because hypoxia damages the mitochondria so basically you're hyper oxygenating a whole bunch of damaged mitochondria and essentially what that does is skyrockets superoxide anion which then through Fenton chemistry so when you have a lot of free iron and all you got a whole bunch of heme and stuff that's being broken down the tumor so you have a lot of free iron driving the

[02:14:53] Fenton reaction and which is producing hydroxyl radicals and that causes a massive oxidative stress specifically to the tumor and you're delivering a massive oxidative stress to the tumor while it's relatively non-toxic to healthy cells that have normal metabolism right because the tumor is thriving in a low oxygen environment in your reversing tumor hypoxia and hyper oxygenating it and you have this environment which is just fueling redox stress you can then trigger apoptosis and necrosis really driving necrosis in these tumor cells so hyperbaric oxygen delivered at the maximum tolerable dose three times per week and you could further enhance the oxidative stress of the tumor by something that's a lot of people haven't heard of this but IV vitamin C so vitamin C if given intravenously and give out up to about a hundred grams about you could yeah 25 two hundred grams is kind of pushing it but vitamin C ascorbic acid also functions as a glucose antagonists yes sure you have dextrose on hand yeah but not if you're in a state of ketosis right so if you're in a state of ketosis so I did a pretty high dose vitamin C but being in a state of ketosis you can tolerate higher amounts right you know what's your glucose dropped to so when you measure your glucose when you're getting vitamin C you get a false positive on the meter falsely high you get falsely high well at least the abbott precision extra yeah it is you know when you measure that meter that a say on the meter is also sensitive to the pH of your blood too and there's a redox shift and but ascorbic acid is a powerful reducing agent and that might be altering the the assay so it's not able to get my glucose like skyrocket I know I went into a hypoglycemic but my ketones were elevated and I took a pretty big hit you know a vitamin C and I was just doing it just for the you know the self experimentation right so but what's the thought here so so I saw lots of people oxidative stress so vitamin C driving the Fenton reaction to produce more oxidative stress so vitamin C is a pro-oxidant when you get blood levels of vitamin C in the millimolar concentration then it becomes a pro-oxidant it's not an antioxidant so we're not using antioxidants are definitely don't want to use it yeah so it's gonna come back to that but the next thing is I'm sure somebody listening to this is gonna say well I don't have access to IV vitamin C if I wanted to do that you can't do it you can't do it orally because of what it's not you can't get it out of the gut enough yeah I can't you can only get like a very small amounts and then you know your gut Auto regulates it - so you just let's get to the next thing you said which is again highly counterintuitive to most people we're hardwired to think that there's nothing better for you than antioxidants yeah but paradoxically once you have cancer that might not be the case yeah so I think antioxidants may be blocking some of the efficacy of some of the some of therapies - right because many chemo therapeutic drugs their function works through enhancing oxidative stress radiation sure does so radiation maybe 20% of the cancer killing effects of radiation are due to damaging the DNA with double you know double strand Nix but 80% of the tumor killing effect of radiation is by the generation of reactive oxygen species now does that mean you can't have blueberries and things that have low levels of antioxidants I would say no but you don't want to kind of saturate your body with a cocktail of antioxidants like you don't want to do a glutathione push right after you do same FNAC see you wouldn't have any seed I personally would not don't think that none of the cancer studies and animal models or humans are supportive of the use of antioxidants and that was a big focus of me I mean when during my PhD I wanted to do a postdoc research in antioxidant cocktails that were gonna save the world and none of the research on antioxidants really panned out in my mind there's a couple things you know maybe for mitochondrial antioxidants for like

[02:19:07] Friedreich's ataxia and maybe ALS and some research there but it's pretty subtle benefits but in the context of cancer no I don't I think antioxidant should be avoided anything else in your pulse protocol yeah I mean there's a lot of things that you could add so with the press protocol I think a low dose of metformin could be helpful too so that will activate amp kinase maybe decrease insulin a little bit maybe increased ketones a little bit too and it's just a readily available cheap drug that has a very good safety profile 500 milligrams to 2,000 milligrams a day are usually well tolerated probably starting with 500 milligrams and working up but when it comes to the pulse protocol hyperbaric oxygen IV vitamin C and there are a number of drugs that were working with now one would be to deoxy glucose which in and of itself from a seizure world and

[02:20:03] I've I've been a reviewer in for the government for different grants and stuff and this is in the context of epilepsy 2dg is sort of like the ketogenic diet and a drug so by inhibiting glycolysis it has this gets back to the question right you have no ketones but you inhibit glycolytic pathways perhaps even like reduce sort of mTOR signaling or some glycolytic thing and that may have anti-seizure effects so 2dg is something that we're working with now I think 2dg originally developed for pharmacologically it's been around for a long time now for a long time I think maybe it was just in the realm of experimental compound but I know there's phase 2 trials in cancer the problem is it becomes cardiotoxic a of say 50 milligrams per kilogram I know can be I know there's some evidence at cardiotoxicity but at 25 milligrams per kilogram at least on some of the grants that I reviewed that was pretty good safety profile for epilepsy so you know not making any recommendations out there but I think 25 milligrams per kilogram seems to be within the realm of therapeutic efficacy and safety and this is being studied in humans and they're out of phase one so this is epileptic world yeah and I think there's some cancer trials going on too and I do think that synergize is really well once you create the environment where you put the press protocol into action then the cancer cells become even very selectively vulnerable to other things like the 2dg will inhibit a glycolytic pathway that drives the pentose phosphate pathway and that pentose phosphate pathway is responsible for enhancing the endogenous antioxidant capacity of cells so it makes the cancer cells even more vulnerable to oxidative stress the more you can inhibit the glycolytic pathways so to dg2 dichloro acetate is something that we've worked with to inhibit speedy h complex and that can be is DCA a drug that's been on the market for a long time it's a small molecule is yeah it's been on the market for a very long time what's it's normally used it's normal use is lactic acidosis actually so one of the side effects of metformin right is is once you start increasing the dose of metformin and escalating the dose the problem that you run into it's still it's it's a very powerful activator of amp kinase its effects are primarily through the liver you know inhibiting gluconeogenesis and it's a mitochondrial toxin throw we published a paper that it increases Ross production from the complex one of the mitochondria so it's inhibiting complex one it's inhibiting yeah mildly inhibiting complex one and it's triggering what the cell experiences as an energetic crisis and then you know it has an activation of amp kinase 2 so you are creating a scenario where that's putting a lot of persistent metabolic stress on the tumor cells and then you come in here with different modalities that have overlapping but independent mechanisms at producing oxidative stress so hyperbaric oxygen IV vitamin C and then cancer specific glycolytic inhibitors to deoxy glucose 3 bromo pyruvate and low knit amine lone enamine is also extra kinase 2 inhibitor and those three drugs that i mentioned right there they are very powerful and they need to probably be used in two weeks on two weeks off and if somebody's listening to this and they're thinking well how the heck could I ever do this are there physicians out there who are obviously doing this under the full and legal umbrella of ethical medical practice is everything clearly theoretical or other ways to actually have these things implemented I think there are some physicians out there that are probably not making it public but I think they are getting success with doing 25% of what I just talked about you know they're not doing all these things but everything that I just mentioned is readily available I mean you could most of the compounds in IV vitamin C hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be costly if you don't have a hardshell chamber but I like that with radiation if you're giving radiation to to your body or it's like going in there with a flamethrower and you have a lot of collateral damage whereas hyperbaric oxygen naturally elevates the precursor for oxygen free radicals and the cancer cells selectively produce more oxygen free radicals so it's a very gentle approach and instead of thinking that we should just go in there and eradicate the tumor I think it's it's more appropriate to give sort of a gentle stress to the tumor so the therapy that

[02:25:08] I'm describing if the patient goes into it they're going to come out of it stronger than they were going into it when you fat adapt in key to adapt your body so many metabolic biomarkers start to go in the right direction when you go in for chemotherapy and radiation and you measure things after your body works big inflammatory mess I mean you're metabolically deranged to your insulin-resistant you are pushing things in you have chemo brain on top of that that may not be reversible the suppression of your immune system with chemo is setting you up for more cancers potentially other cancers so the scenario that we envision is a comprehensive metabolic based therapy where you go into it and it's a more gradual approach and you start adding these modalities sort of as you go you know get the patient acclimated you know with that glucose ketone index of one to two and then start utilizing some of these other therapies you could potentially put someone on an IV right and pulse a low dose of insulin to make them hypoglycemic even one or two millimolar and then deliver some of these agents where you've really restricted the fermentable fuels so I was you know I'm a reviewer on different manuscripts that are coming in and some of these academic and and clinical oncologists are actually suggesting this and léo medical hypothesis papers now and that's kind of counterintuitive because you'd think well we don't the last thing you want to do for a tumor is give it insulin because this is so because they say also tile and it's acute and the amount of insulin it's not like 20 IU's it's something like 1 or 2

[02:26:48] IU's so patient comes in fasted and you give them just a little bit and that's facilitating mostly facilitating glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle so making it less available for the tumor right and that creates a scenario where you produce severe what would typically be fatal hypoglycemia and you could deliver ketones you know as an insurance and and also deliver some of these agents that would you'd probably dramatically sensitize that tumor tissue to the other modalities and and I know so I mean what

[02:27:24] I didn't talk about when I did this 7 day fast like years ago I brought my glucose levels down really low and I got to a glucose ketone index of 1 or maybe even a little bit lower than 1 so you're about what 3 to 4 on each of them yeah well my ketones were about four five and my glucose got down to three so that was the lowest I ever like captured and that was just a seven day fast yeah after 75 you know after a brisk walk at the end see I never got like ketone 7 or II like I got it like for you know after like a long fast but then

[02:27:58] I did inspired by the Cahill study I used various strategies to bring my glucose level down you know pharmacological strategies and I I did it slowly and just do me a favor dumb yeah I really would be kind of pissed off if you like offed yourself doing dumb because I think the world kind of needs you to stick around so yeah see if you can just maybe get an IRB to do this in the mice or something nothing that would break my heart more than getting a call from your wife saying uh yeah Dom died of some freak hypoglycemia crazy accident what's the longest fast you've ever done well that was it yeah and I was pretty adapted and the point I was kind of getting to that I brought my glucose down to where it was not even measurable but with exogenous ketones she's I was the meter didn't even read it so that to me and I did that years ago that motivated me more to basically focus on this area of research as sort of like my life research because it validated to me that this should not be happening and ketones are an alternative energy source that can be utilized in these metabolic based therapies that can be game changers for and we also studied glucose transporter type 1 deficiencies and right which is a inability and people who have glut 1d don't get cancer to my knowledge I've talked to the doctors and they've never came across anyone with glucose transporter so that's kind of motivating to to that you can use a therapy for that that could sort of be a magic magic bullet well what's interesting is this is sort of in many ways old-school science right where scientists would begin by sort of experimenting on themselves ident buying unnatural or extreme physiologic conditions that are not predicted by the current understanding yeah and then that sort of provokes further investigation remind me again at the end of that seven-day fast how much did you deadlift yeah I did five hundred pounds for ten and then I did sort of a one repper at the end was six plates or 585 but that's below my you know normal but it was it was amazing to me that you know I didn't want to push my body too hard but it was amazing that that amount of fasting does not really impact you were how much of a verdict so what was your max at that time at that time what was tinkering around with like you know QJ kinda fasting a lot but within a year of that time I forget if it was before after I did 675 for five and maybe I did 555 for an eight to ten so so I did you know an extra plate for eight to ten but I went into this basically I felt like it did more I could have done more but I just wanted to stop I didn't want to hurt myself because I knew I was pushing the limits at that point and I didn't get sore at all so I did that and it wasn't like my body was broken down and sort of in a depleted State where I was wasted the next day I felt I didn't even have to recover from that like I had no lower back soreness the next day after that so I probably was like I probably couldn't went heavier but it was just validation to me that if you're in a keto adapted stay your body is very resilient and from a military standpoint to which we work pretty closely with the military I'm trying to sort of get them to understand this idea that if you are fat and Ketu adapted and you're faced in austere conditions with limited food availability you could maintain your physical and cognitive resilience in those in those conditions which is pretty clear to me I was pretty much obsessed with eating like six meals a day for many years and it was very liberating not to have to do that now and I'm amazed at how little I can eat once your key to adapted and maintained you know your your size and your strength I'm not trying to be big anymore or anything or try to do any records in the gym but it's amazing how

[02:31:58] II it is to maintain once your body is adapted you've been so generous with your time I want to sort of let you get on your way I know you've got a long drive potentially tonight but I want to ask you a question or the couple maybe what do you believe today to be true that five years ago you did not believe to be true let's keep it within the purview of your ketogenic life what today do you think things that really I would say when I got into this field I was really fascinated and immersed in this idea as ketones as an alternative energy source so is even like space food you know and we're still working on that front but then over the last five years the observation that beta-hydroxybutyrate is a powerful endogenous metabolite that's also a signaling molecule through its H DAC activity histone deacetylase immunity more recently we've been working with an organization that the name of the organization has called all things kabuki so there's a there's a rare genetic disease called kabuki syndrome which is a gene defect in the

[02:33:07] KMT 2d which is essentially an Isetta Lay's enzyme and a defect in that gene or that protein creates an imbalance between gene expression and gene repression right and in the mouse model of kabuki syndrome two things have worked in this mouse model one is a histone deacetylase inhibitor HTA inhibitor called AR 42 which restores neurons in the dentate gyrus and kind of silences the pathological features in this mouse model and another thing is nutritional ketosis so nutritional ketosis functioning as a histone deacetylase inhibitor basically salvages or rescues the phenotype of this and circumvents this gene mutation the KMT 2d mutation the animals have a normal neuronal density in the dentate gyrus and even from a behavioral characteristic and enhances sort of learning and memory so this idea that and endogenous metabolites can epigenetically sort of control gene transcription so I believe it's probably not unique to beta-hydroxybutyrate I think metabolites we know that's true for acetyl co a and other things are epigenetic drivers and I think they are really they call the shots so you can even take a step back and say the mitochondria kind of call the shots - right because I think mitochondrial health and mitochondrial vitality would be the ultimate tumor suppressor so if the bioenergetic capacity of a cell in tissues are maintained to a high degree that bioenergetic efficiency is going to preserve genome stability and be far less likely to trigger Alko genes at the level of the DNA so when it comes to something like kabuki syndrome you have a persistent molecular genetic pathology that's silenced by the elevation of beta-hydroxybutyrate functioning in a moment in impendent way yeah there it's HD activity so that to me is like mind blowing and I think that's a direction kind of our lab is going into now I'm always fascinating with developing alternative energy substrates and alternative fuels as a form of nutrition for tactical applications space applications maybe but this idea that you could develop an even engineer Nutrition to have powerful effects on gene transcription and epigenetic regulation is something I would have never predicted that's an amazing answer actually because and I know that was probably a little hard for some people to follow so what you're basically saying is look five years ago you were completely intrigued and blown away by the metabolic properties of these ketones that primarily as an alternative energy source and with that comes a lot of interesting stuff we've talked about but at this age dak pathway this inhibition of something that can result in epigenetic change or activation of in this case you can basically take a germline acquired mutations and silenced it with an epi genetic overlay that seems to be signaled by something as simple as ketones and dr. V redeemeth the buck Institute has spoken quite a bit about this as well I mean this really is one of those moments where you think holy cow we are really at the just at the cusp of learning about this stuff and if there's one reason to make sure we don't offer ourselves with self experiments it's to make sure we can stick around long enough to do this done working people follow you socially and then maybe more importantly see what you're doing and from a research perspective sure so the site I maintain for informational purposes it would be keto Nutrition o-r-g it's a or G not calm and on that website

[02:37:10] I have a list of you know podcast there's nutrition consultants resources like the Charlie Foundation which is an incredible resource that I've helped them do some educational work and and Jim Abraham's of the Charlie foundation has really created an amazing resource there I have a blog and we test various ketone supplements ketogenic foods I'm self experimenting and I've collected a lot of data and we'll be putting some of that data in the blog so I think that would be sort of like the one-stop-shop website for anyone interested in hearing more about what I talked about I'd also like to mention that our lab in collaboration with epigenetics foundation is sponsoring the metabolic health summit that's occurring in

[02:37:55] January 30th to February 3rd in Long Beach California and it's going to have an amazing array of basic scientists for example like Lou cantly will be there be a keynote speaker Thomas say ffred there's going to be clinicians there influencers there and a lot of entrepreneurial people will be there representing companies that are really changing the shape of this industry so

[02:38:23] I'm very interested in technologies and foods and supplements that can make nutritional ketosis accessible for people that want to use it not only therapeutically for metabolic management of a disorder but maybe also for prevention or longevity or just as a lifestyle so you're gonna find there's something for everybody at the metabolic help summit from basic science will be sort of what our lab is focused on but from clinical application to moving the science into human application is really the theme of that and can people read it on for that already yes I think you can go to the website and register if you want to be a sponsor I think you can sort of download the sponsorship package there's going to be a lot of high profile representation there that would bring sort of more awareness and more reach to your product if you have a product there so we're looking for sponsors and I think we've nailed down most of our speakers but if you're interested in speaking to it might be good to contact us through the website got it and on Twitter you're pretty active what's your handle yeah before I realize how important is to have a like handle you can remember it's Dominic died ghosty - well link - yeah well yeah link to it it's not the easiest to remember and also Facebook I'm fairly active Dominic D'Agostino one I think that's my handle on Facebook - so I kind of cross post on each and try to use

[02:39:51] Instagram a little bit more because they tell me I got to use it more but not too active on that but all right well make sure we link through all of those things I want to thank you again I owe a lot of what I know in this space to you and I can say the same thank you yeah incredibly blogged it's been a great resource for many you were arguably one of the most generous people I've ever met when it comes to his insights Dom I don't know that you get enough credit for not only the work you've done but for how much work you do behind the scenes as far as sharing your knowledge with people I'll just share one very quick anecdote personally one of my best friends from medical school his wife has breast cancer and you know without any hesitation you were more than happy to speak with them about some of these things that they could do above and beyond what was she was already doing which was participating in a clinical trial where by the way she is the only woman to still be alive in this clinical trial so the trial has closed that agent will likely not be approved though she will have a compassionate exemption but you know she is someone who has been on a ketogenic diet now for six years and has and remains incredibly indebted to the work that you've done and her oncologist in Boston are sort of amazed that she's alive that's interestingly next year Lou Cantley will be explaining a very plausible mechanism for why she is still alive it's a paper that I'm sure you're aware of that was just approved and will be out in nature very soon so anyway if I could sit here and spend another hour thanking you for everything but I know nobody really wants to hear that so I'll I'll be quick about it and just tell you again that

[02:41:24] Dom you're you're an amazing guy you you really are one of those people that I think fits in the category of just being kind of a treasurer and so on behalf of many people I want to thank you and thank you thank you for giving me this platform I know your podcasts will be an amazing resource for so many people and always great to catch up with you always very stimulating and in so many ways thank you for for having me you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter DMV com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
