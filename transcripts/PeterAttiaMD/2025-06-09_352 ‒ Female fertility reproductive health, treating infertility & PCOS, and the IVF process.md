## Transcript

[00:00:00] Getting this looked at now is a great way to get ahead of an infertility problem 10 years hence. For sure. Women are born with a finite number of eggs. Actually, the most eggs you'll ever have is when you're in your mom's womb. So, let's just walk through how IVF works. Usually about 70% of the eggs fertilized. That's an important message for anybody listening. If you're trying to get pregnant, you should not be on a

[00:00:22] GLP1 agonist, right? You can be on it pre-reg, just the recommendation is to stop for at least 2 months. Okay. Now having said that there have been lots of you may have read about ampic babies. Do you caution women or do we know anything about too much exercise? Extreme exercise can be associated um with fertility issues. We talked about semen analysis being kind of a marker of other health outcomes. Your periods are also a marker. Don't wait till you're ready to try to get pregnant to figure that out.

[00:00:51] You know, there may be something important you need to know way ahead of time. If a woman came to you at 20 and said, "I just want to double down on my career right now. Uh, I want to do X, Y, and Z. I think I want to have kids. I at least want the optionality. When should I freeze by?" Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive

[00:01:10] Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia. Hey Paula, thank you so much for for coming to Austin and um sitting down to share some remarkable insights. Uh you know listeners last week will have heard us talk about all things that pertain to male fertility. Um and as promised we're going to now talk about uh fertility but from the female perspective. The physiology here is is different uh but no less complex. Um and there are some some pretty unique things about it. One of them being that unlike sperm which seem to be an infinite uh resource uh men are constantly generating literally billions of these things. uh the exact opposite is the case with with women.

[00:01:54] Tell us a bit about that. That's right. Well, first, thanks for having me. Thanks for inviting me. Uh it is true that when an embryo or fetus develops, uh the gonad differentiates into either a testes or an ovary. And the main difference, as you said, is that sperm is produced throughout a man's lifetime, whereas women are born with a finite number of eggs. Actually, the most eggs you'll ever have is when you're in your mom's womb as a fetus. And by the time you're born, there's about two million or so eggs. And by the time you start menstruating, you're down to maybe 400,000 or so. And wow. Five. So, a five-fold reduction from birth to say I average age would be maybe 14 when a

[00:02:39] Yeah. Yeah. 12 to 14. And we don't know why exactly that happens, but most of the eggs in the ovaries actually undergo a process we call atreia. They basically die. M so once uh a woman goes through puberty or girl goes through puberty every month if she's not on hormonal contraception one of those eggs grows actually probably a group of eggs every month starts to grow but then one kind of takes over and is released from the ovary and usually finds its way into the fallopian tubes. That's the tube connecting the ovary and the uterus. And then normally if there's not sperm around the egg is just resorbs and there's no pregnancy and the lining of the uterus sheds and a girl or woman has a period every month. If there's sperm around there's a chance that that egg might fertilize and that fertilization usually happens in the fallopian tube actually and then that now zygote or embryo travels down the tube into the uterus and some of the time implants into the wall of the uterus or the lining of the uterus and establishes a pregnancy. Okay. So let's now talk about a woman in the prime of her reproductive age. She's 20 years old. um as as an example and um let's let's talk through the cycle of um what is happening and the role that hormones are playing. Um one of the things that to me has always been fascinating about this is the selection, right? So with with males, we don't have to think about that problem.

[00:04:14] The selection tends to be maybe more metabolic or stochastic. In other words, which sperm is the sperm that makes it isn't really predetermined. How is it that let's say from day zero when a woman begins her menstrual cycle and all of a sudden everything starts to turn towards the next cycle, she's about 14 days out from ovulation, we start to see the interplay of luteinizing hormone and follical stimulating hormone, particularly FSH. walk me through what's happening in that period of time that ultimately leads to one and only one egg being the chosen one. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little random in women as well actually, but it's true that the pituitary hormones namely FSH or follicle stimulating hormone and LH luteinizing hormone are what drives growth of the we call them follicles.

[00:05:08] The eggs are inside the follicles. And as I said, usually a cohort of eggs starts to grow. And then tell me what grow means. The follicles start to um get bigger and the cells surrounding the eggs start to divide. And what do they look like prior to all of that happening? These are cells that only have 50% of the genetic material, right?

[00:05:33] They've already undergone meiosis. Yes. it meiosis. They're kind of arrested in meiosis and meiosis not completed until they actually ovulate and then in some cases are fertilized. Yes. So we have an arrested cell that has uh one of each of the mother's chromosomes including one X chromosome by definition, one of her two sex hormones.

[00:06:01] And I don't know if this question makes sense, but it's is it still in its young phenotype? In other words, if the if the woman is 20 years old and all of the cells in her body are functionally 20 years old, is this egg prior to uh ovulation still basically an infant cell? As far as we know, although there's some data recently to suggest that um perhaps the cells surrounding the egg are um metabolically active and may be aging. Certainly, we do know that the quality of the eggs decreases, right, as women get older. So, that affects how the eggs and the chromosomes ultimately divide. That's part of the reason it's harder to get pregnant as you get older. Even though you're ovulating, you may be releasing an egg every month, but that egg could be abnormal. And if it's abnormal, it likely won't fertilize. And you kind of don't want it to fertilize if it's abnormal and establish a pregnancy. Um but you're right, it's they're pretty much arrested in time during um certainly you know before puberty and then every month a few start to develop and then one we don't really know how that one egg is selective. Okay, it's definitely hormonal factors play a role um but it's somewhat random. One kind of grows and then eventually is released.

[00:07:32] Now, not to anthropomorphize this too much, but one would sort of assume that natural selection runs strong. And if a woman by the time she begins her uh fertility stage of life has 400,000 eggs, just say on average, she only has a finite number of shots on goal, right? Let's just say 12 per year. And I don't know, let's just say if you look at peak reproductive, maybe 20 years, right? So that's a tiny sliver of 400,000. That's true. You would have to assume that there is some selection that's happening to pick the best few hundred of those 400,000. Is there any evidence that that's happening? Only in that the ones that usually result in pregnancy are chromosomally normal. M so most of the embryos are chromosomally abnormal and that's because most of the eggs are chromosomally abnormal. So there is selection in that sense that it's most of the time only the chromosomally normal embryos are the ones that implant and continue to develop. And when you say chromosomally normal are you referring to the egg or the zygote? The zygote. But most of the abnormalities in in chromosomes that happen in a zygote are believed to be related to maternal age. And does that mean we think that the abnormality occurred way before ovulation or when do we think that that occurred? We think it occurred in the stage of meiosis that happens as the egg is developing that much that ripening phase. Okay. So explain how that happens. So, so if you if you were to sample eggs from a 5-year-old girl, nowhere near reproductive age, do we So, every one of those is in a state of frozen meiosis where how many things have to happen before it is ready to undergo full meiosis? In other words, how does it go from that stage to um just I'll I'll I'm sorry for using big words to the listener and and please feel free to explain what I mean by annuploity, but how do you go from that frozen myotic state to an anuploic state? And please explain what I just said to people.

[00:09:50] Sure. Uh it's a little bit of a black box of course because we can't see exactly what's happening. But the way we understand it is that the cells start off including egg cells as having you know two copies of each chromosome but eventually has to become one copy in order to combine with a sperm that also has one copy of each chromosome. So during that process there has to be disjunct disjunction of each of the pairs of chromosomes. So there 23 pairs of chromosomes including uh X and Y the sex chromosomes. Um and during that dis disjunction phase is when we think most of the errors happen because if they don't divide evenly like 23 and 23 you're going to get an extra one or you're going to be missing one. And then when it combines with sperm that also has a hloid set of chromosomes there's going to be an abnormal number and that affects development. And that completion only occurs during the 14 days leading to ovulation. Ovulation and then fertilization. Yes. Okay. So that explains why to my earlier question there must be something even though they are quote unquote frozen in time. There is either something going on with the egg or maybe the metabolic millu around the egg from those cells that is changing the probability of success for that division of genetic material right and because the as we know that as a woman ages the probability of successful division goes down right so something changes as a woman ages but we don't understand exactly but whatever it is that's going on makes those chromosome errors much more likely. I I'll tell you a very interesting story. Um so a very close friend of mine has a son with Down syndrome and you know he's he's probably 20 now. So this is the son of course. So so this the story I'm telling occurred roughly 20 years ago. So when their son was born um I believe he was their third child.

[00:12:00] Um obviously this is you know this is probably at a time I I don't think they knew until this was this in fact I know that they didn't know until birth they hadn't done amnocentesis or anything like that. So they're you know they're they're sort of dealing with this right in the aftermath of their of their son's birth. And the uh the doctor the the gyn came in and uh my friend says he never forget this. The guy looked straight at um his wife and said, "Look, it's important for you to understand that this is your fault." Oh my god. My friend said he wanted to jump across the table and kill this guy. Yeah, I don't blame him. But then what he realized is what he was actually saying is um this is the result of the egg releasing one too many. So there there they you know he had two copies of was it 21? Yeah.

[00:12:52] So, two copies of 21 instead of one copy of 21 came from the egg. And you know, it's interesting. My friend and I have talked about this many times since. And he said, "I really came to appreciate what he was trying to do there, albeit in an completely clumsy way. He was just trying to explain that there is a reason for this. It is maternal and and whatever." But anyway, it always stuck with me as like that's a great lesson in bad bedside manner. Um, for sure. Yeah.

[00:13:19] But you know he made the point. So um so the point here being is while tricom 21 is a very common form of annuploity it's also not lethal. There are many lethal forms of annuploy as well. Right. Right. Tricome 21 can be lethal but not always. Okay. Yeah. So some of those pregnancies do continue and there depending on the chromosomeal abnormalities. Some only do de develop to a certain point and then stop developing and some are actually compatible with live birth but usually have some abnormalities.

[00:13:52] And do we know for example that for um if you were to look at all miscarriages that occur inside the first trimester? Would you be able to hazard a guess as to what percentage of all miscarriages inside of 13 weeks are likely the result of annuployy? Definitely the majority of them. Probably close to 90% of them.

[00:14:12] Yeah. Okay. So, in other words, maybe someone listening to this who's experienced miscarriages early in a pregnancy can take some solace in understanding that that was the body's way of correcting something that was inevitable sooner rather than later. Yeah, I think that's true. Yeah, they're very miscarriages are very common and that's the most common cause. Uh although there are other causes. Um usually we don't do a whole lot of testing if it's just one miscarriage because that's very common. We just assume y fetus or embryo was abnormal. U but if a woman has like two in a row then that warrants some additional testing to make sure regardless of her age. Regardless of her age I mean obviously the chances of finding something else goes down as a woman gets older but yeah because you don't want to miss another cause that's potentially treatable. Okay. Well, let's put a pin in that because I actually want to understand that more. But that's interesting to me that if a 40year-old woman had successive miscarriages, you wouldn't just chalk it up to, well, she's 40. Of course, these are annuploitic eggs. Okay. Yeah, that's true. I mean, that's most likely. Most likely, but you don't want to miss, especially at 40, you don't want to miss some treatable other treatable, right?

[00:15:25] Because you only have so much time. Yeah. So again, one of the lessons here hopefully for people listening is uh if a if if a couple miscarriages um they shouldn't feel that they've done something wrong. The woman shouldn't beat herself up thinking, "Oh my god, I did I have one too many cups of coffee or was I I'm under too much stress." No, greater than 90% chance this was a bad split. And that's the way Okay, so let's go back to this process. So it's day zero. So, a woman just begins her period. We're just getting ready to embark on her next fertility cycle. The pituitary gland is secretreting luteinizing hormone and follical stimulating hormone. Walk me through what is happening in the next 14 days that leads to that ovulation. Um, right.

[00:16:13] So, a group of eggs or follicles are starting to grow. One gets selected. We don't really understand. We don't understand why. It's random. Wow. Um, and that follicle that's egg is in a follicle. Follicles is kind of um fluid fil cyike structure that surrounds each egg. So that continues to grow and then eventually uh what's happening hormonally? So those cells surrounding the eggs are producing estrogen. That estrogen is preparing acting on the uterine lining to build up the lining to potentially support a pregnancy. And then what happens just before ovulation is there's um a surge in a hormone called LH luteinizing hormone. And that's what we think triggers ovulation or release of an egg.

[00:17:01] So all that has to happen before an egg is released. So it kind of busts out of the ovary, finds its way to the tube. How energetically demanding is that? We learned last week in talking with Paul that the ATP requirement for those sperm to travel all that distance is unbelievable. Uh what how passive versus active is the movement of that egg? How metabolically demanding is it? I don't know that we understand it completely, but you would imagine that their energy is required for for that uh to happen.

[00:17:38] Certainly. So it's not passive. It's not just sort of a diffusion down the fallopian tube, right? Prostaglandins are involved and a lot calcium all kinds of things have to happen for for that process to occur. Okay. How long approximately just give people a sense of how long a fallopian tube is? Probably a few centimeters like 5 to 10.

[00:18:00] Okay. Mhm. And um you know, everyone's probably used to seeing the image of ovaries being these little eggs and fallopian tubes having these little fingers that hug up on the eggs. What what is actually in between that space? How does the how does the egg get from an ovary into a fallopian tube? Is there an actual connection there? There is actually. Yeah. They're not stuck together, but they're kind of in close proximity so that those fimria or finger-like projections kind of sweep up the egg once it's released from the ovary. Got it. And it's otherwise in direct contact with the parinium, the ovary and the tubes, the space between the space between them. Yeah.

[00:18:39] Yeah. The pictures always show like the tubes out here and the eggs out here, but they're actually everything's like a lot closer together in the pelvis. Yeah. And um you mentioned Okay, so egg is now in fallopian tube. How long does it take to get through the length of the fallopian tube into the uterus? About five or six days. Okay. So completely different experience from the sperm which are racing at breakneck speed and cover that distance in seconds right. Um so what regulates the speed with which the egg travels through the fallopian tube and how does that impact fertility?

[00:19:16] Is there a scenario whereby it happens too quickly and things don't work? I don't know about too quickly but there are uh hairlike projections in the tubes cyia that kind of help with motility of the egg. down the fallopian tube into the uterus. Uh the abnormalities in on the female side have to do more with potential abnormalities have to do with like scarring in the tubes or if the tubes are blocked that and then it interferes with the egg like encountering the sperm. And what what leads to that? A number of different things. infection probably most commonly but also scarring from previous surgery potentially or a condition called endometriosis. So there are a number of things that can affect the the tubes as well. And so is the day for if assuming a woman's cycle is predictable and normal and we would just say day 14 is ovulation. That is the day that the egg leaves the ovary or that is the day that the egg reaches a certain place within the fallopian tube. pretty much the day that the egg is released from the ovary.

[00:20:22] Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And you usually encounter sperm in the fallopian tube and that's where fertilization usually happens. And then it takes a few more days for the embryo now or pre-mbbryo to travel down the rest of the tube into the uterus and hopefully implant if it's normal. Now, one of the most interesting things here that is worth repeating even though we talked about it last week in case anybody missed it. How many sperm is the egg encountering at the time of fertilization? Roughly millions. Yeah.

[00:20:53] Millions. Millions. So, why is it and this I know the answer to this question, but it is so cool. Why is it that one and only one sperm out of millions or even less than that, but let's just say it's hundreds of thousand. Why does only one get to uh transmit its genetic material into that egg? Well, once an egg is fertilized, there's sort of a chemical reaction, if you will, that happens that prevents any other sperm from fertilizing the eggs cuz that would be bad, right? You only want one sperm and one egg to combine. Yeah. It's incred like just there's like an electrical force field that immediately activates around the egg. Exactly. I I find this so fascinating. That is fascinating. And brilliant. Yeah. So, okay. So now we have and by the way uh what is the relative size of an egg to a sperm? The egg is actually much bigger than the sperm. I don't know exactly in microns how how big it is but I feel like I used to know this answer and it's shocking how how desperate they are in size. Like the egg is I believe the biggest cell in the body potentially.

[00:21:55] Yeah, I've checked on that but I believe that's true. All right. So yeah, you have this massive egg that's basically like the sun and like this tiny little sperm which is like the earth and you know colliding with it. Okay. So um fertilization takes place um and how long from fertilization for how long from impact um until you have that single cell zygote that actually has a lined up pair of chromosomes. Is that a matter of hours? Yeah, within a few hours. Yeah. Okay. And then what is the process that occurs uh for cell division for when that zygote goes from one to two to four to eight cells and and how so a how long does that take and and and b at what point does it implant into the uterus? Yeah. So most of what we know actually about this is from in vitro fertilization or IVF because we can actually see that happening in the petri dish. So, so usually the with IVF um an egg is fertilized with sperm. By the next day, we can see if it's fertilized and we know if it's fertilized because it has what we call two pr-uclei. So,

[00:23:09] DNA from the sperm and DNA from the egg. And then over the course of the next couple of days, it divides into maybe six to eight cells. So about 3 days after fertilization it's it's 6 to eight cells and then by 5 to 6 days it's about 60 to 80 cells and that's kind of the stage where it implants in the uterus. So five six days after fertilization.

[00:23:38] All right. So with that said, now that we have a pretty good understanding of what all needs to happen for fertilization and implantation, what is the biggest risk to that? And when does it cease to become a zygote? By the way, I don't remember any of my terminology here. You have zygot and blastopheres or blastoytes. Yeah. Yeah. A zygote I think is is still a a single cell that's been you know fertilized and egg and sperm combined. Um then it starts to divide.

[00:24:14] We call it a pre- embryo. Okay. And then by two weeks we call it an embryo. But in IVF we we call it an embryo even in the first few days. Assuming that we have um chromosomeal alignment. Mhm. Um it's two weeks out. So we have a two-week old embryo that is implanted. What is the greatest risk that is faced by that embryo to uh coming to fruition as a fetus or in fact going all the way into the third trimester like so in other words we've taken the biggest risk off off the table which is annuployloy. What are the other risks it faces? So once a pregnancy is established you mean? Yes. Yes. So if it's a normal embryo chances are pretty good that it continues to churn. Okay.

[00:25:02] Okay. So, let's define normal. So, normal at the macro level means chromosomally normal. What else requires normality? Any other genetic issues that get in the way here? There are other genes that, you know, play a role in embryo development where those are less understood, but there's certainly other genes involved. So, you could have a chromosomally normal embryo that fails to develop for other reasons. Okay.

[00:25:25] Okay. And then there could be uterine factors that also play a role. So an embryo may implant, but if there's some structural abnormality, for example, in the uterus, maybe that pregnancy can't continue and may result in a miscarriage. Got it. Okay. So, let's talk about a patient that comes to you and they're and they're they're going to say, you know, we're we're having difficulty conceiving. Um, what are the questions you have to to render the diagnosis of infertility, meaning we need some intervention versus h you just need to make a few adjustments in something and I'm not willing to put the label of infertility on. So, how do you is that would that be the first bifurcation in thinking? Yeah, we want to take a full medical history of both partners if it's a couple and that includes, you know, medical history, reproductive history, psychosocial history, sexual history, all those things are important.

[00:26:28] Lifestyle factors, we ask about all those things. And the definition of infertility is is trying for about a year. So unprotected intercourse for about a year without success. That's the sort of medical definition of infertility. But we start our testing uh after a year in women who are less than 35 and after 6 months if a woman is older than 35. Even though it may take longer to get pregnant if you're older, if there's something wrong, you kind of want to know about it sooner rather than later. So, if a couple uh a female partner is over 35 and she they've been trying having time intercourse at the right time and still not pregnant, then we would initiate some preliminary investigations. Um on the female side, what's most important usually is we want to ask about the woman's menstrual cycles. You know, are they regular? Is she tracking ovulation? You know, do does it look like she's ovulating, etc.

[00:27:27] The male side, you know, we want to ask about sexual function. have they had a semen analysis? If not, we usually order one because we're interested in the sperm concentration, the motility of the sperm, the shape of the sperm, those types of things. Yeah. One one of the things I was very surprised by in the podcast that we did last week on male fertility was how infrequently men are getting evaluated and how many missed opportunities. In other words, how much how much wasted time is being generated because infertility is being assumed to be the the responsibility of the female.

[00:28:03] Responsibility might be the wrong word, but it's just assumed that well that's more likely where it is. And so through no bad intention, the guy is not getting evaluated when in reality the issue could have been with him all along. And that's right, time is time is wasted. Right. When you look at the data, it's about a third of the time it's a female factor, a third of the time it's a male factor, and another third of the time it's some combination of male and female factor. So yes, definitely one of the first things that we do is a semen analysis on the male partner. And do you guys do that yourselves as well or do you at the fertility clinic? Yeah, if if there is an abnormality, we usually refer that uh male partner to a reproductive urologist uh for further evaluation. Um, but these days it's recommended actually that men even if they're not trying to get pregnant sometimes assess their their semen analysis and because it can be a marker of other health problems just like a woman's menstrual cycle can be a marker of other health problems. So I should qualify that one-year time frame. If you have some reason to believe that you have a fertility problem, I wouldn't necessarily wait a whole year and then go see a, you know, a provider. If your cycles are irregular, if you think you might have polycystic ovary syndrome or something, then you definitely want to see somebody sooner than a year. Is it possible to say anything about fertility rates changing over the past 50 years?

[00:29:23] Uh c is there any statement you can you can make on that? Yeah, there's some data that seems to suggest that infertility rates are increasing over the last several years. Uh it's pretty common. I don't know if your listeners know but about you know the lifetime risk of infertility for each person is about one in six. So that's close to 20%. Uh in the last few years in the

[00:29:45] United States seems to be kind of a plateau of the prevalence. But let me let me just ask a clarifying question Paula. So if a woman gets pregnant in her 20s Mhm. but then in her 30s meets the criteria for infertility, would she be considered one of those one in six? Okay. Yeah. So, it just it's So, we're going to say that the one in six means someone who wants to get pregnant at a certain point in their life can't.

[00:30:12] Exactly. Lifetime prevalence. Exactly. Exactly. And as far as the reasons for the increase in infertility prevalence, it's not super well understood. Part of the reason is delayed childbearing. I was just about to say you could make it 100% if every woman decides to have a baby when she's 70. By definition, you have 100% fertility. Yeah. Infertility.

[00:30:34] So women are waiting longer, of course, to start their families, to pursue education, career, etc. Maybe they haven't found the right partner. And so that definitely is contributing to to increased rates of fertilities. There's some data that show that sperm counts are decreasing globally. It's a little controversial, but that may be playing a role. Uh there might be a slight increased risk in sexually transmitted diseases as well. So all those things are are probably factors. Is there an analysis that's tried to get at this by normalizing to female age? Because it seems to me that if you could say rather than make it lifetime prevalence, because that's going to be subject to all the problems you stated, but what if we just said for women aged 28 to 32, 32 to 35, 35, like if we made narrow buckets of age, we could we could then kind of get a better sense of whether there's a true infertility issue. Has that analysis been done? It's definitely been looked at by age. I don't know the data off top of my head if if it's been looked at by age over time, but definitely your chance of infertility is higher if you're 40 compared to if you're 20 or even 30. But do we know if a 30year-old woman today has a higher rate of infertility than a 30year-old woman 50 years ago? We think so, but I don't know that data off the top of my head. I got it. And so if the answer there is yes, we would then I don't know that it would answer all our questions because it could still be explained by decreasing sperm count. It could still be incre explained by increasing paternal age. You know this this would be a very difficult analysis to do.

[00:32:15] Right. Right. Environmental factors as well. You know our exposures are different now than they were 50 years ago. Well and then the question of course would be if this is an environmental reason what are the environmental triggers? Now you mentioned STDs a minute ago. So how do STDs and which STDs play a role in fertility? The ones most well understood are probably gorrhea and chlamydia which are very common sexually transmitted diseases. And on the female side those particular infections can ascend to the fallopian tubes and cause scarring in the fallopian tubes which then interfere with that process that we talked about earlier the egg and the sperm meeting and can lead to infertility. And is that something that happens if it is left untreated or is that something that's easy to address with antibiotics if caught early? I mean, if it's caught early, then it's usually treatable with antibiotics or there are some issues with antibiotic resistance, especially with gorrhea. But usually if you catch it early, it's treatable. Um, but if it's late stage or it's unrecognized or untreated, then it has more likely more likely to ascend to the fallopian tubes where it usually cause fertility problems. How prevalent is gorrhea today in the US? I think it's pretty common. I don't know. Really? Yeah. Yeah. In certain populations is more common than others, but um yeah, unfortunately, and there's a number of reasons for that.

[00:33:39] Some of it is just lack of awareness and education about about safe sex practices. Um maybe less testing as well, especially we saw that during the pandemic for sure. How does it present in women usually with um pelvic pain, fever, vaginal discharge? Those are the most common symptoms. And is it equally transmissible from male to female and female to male? It's probably more transmissible from male to female.

[00:34:11] Okay. And is it is it an STD where the person who has it knows they like if a male has it, does he know he has it? Not always. Presumably not if it's being transmitted this readily. Yeah. Not always. Okay. Yeah. Uh what about HSV? Does that factor into fertility at all? Uh not as much. No. And chlamydia.

[00:34:31] Again, I apologize for my ignorance. I just don't remember any of this stuff since taking uh you know the the USMLE exams. Uh tell me how chlamydia presents and and how it impacts fertility. The same actually. Yeah, very similarly. So pelvic pain, fever, uh usually they're they're both present together. Okay. And does it have the same pathology where it creates it ascends the fallopian tubes and scars the tubes? Yeah. So if if worst case scenario, if a woman underos a severe infection with one or both of these, um it's not treated in time, she has completely scarred fallopian tubes, is it still likely that she could get pregnant through IVF? Are the eggs still general is the are the eggs and uterus still preserved enough to Yes. Yes. It doesn't usually affect the uterus or the eggs or the ovaries. Yes. Now, she may not know that she has blocked tubes until she starts trying because you wouldn't necessarily feel different if your tubes were blocked. So, one of the tests we were talking earlier about, you know, what testing we might do in addition to a semen analysis and getting a menstrual history, etc., is we usually do an X-ray test. It's called a hyroalpingogram or HSG for short and it's done specifically to evaluate whether or not the tubes are open. So are you just injecting contrast in you go you go in I assume you do this externally. You go into the uter into the cervix into the and you just inject dye and take an X-ray. Exactly. And you're looking for how smooth and so tell me what does a normal fallopian tube look like on that test? So first the die. So it's done in radiology facility usually by radiologists although some gynecologists do this this test as well but usually fills up the uterus. So you can also see the uterus and then the tubes are kind of like these wire like Yeah. How what's the diameter of a normal fallopian tube in that setting? Like less than a centimeter. Yeah. That that's that's pretty big. Yeah. The whole tube but the the actual sort of opening le how big is the lumen? microns. Oh wow. Okay. Or millimeters. I don't know. Exactly. But you can see it. Definitely see it on

[00:36:42] X-ray and you can see Well, you can see it. It's probably a millimeter or more than not a micron. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. And then the dye is filling up the tubes and then spilling out the tubes. So you can see that the ovaries are not visualized because of the finger-like projection. So it's actually spilling dye into the paranium at this point.

[00:36:57] Right. Okay. Right. And based on that visual inspection, a a trained radiologist NGYN can say that is smooth, that looks great versus that is jagged and/or obstructed. Right now, if it's obstructed, yeah, I assume that the woman has a much bigger problem, which is every month one of those eggs comes out. It's not getting past the point.

[00:37:24] Does it just atrophy and get reabsorbed? I see. So, it wouldn't necessarily cause pain. No, no. By the way, we didn't talk about this earlier. We took it for granted. This is happening with two separate sides. Yeah. And like it's it's just mindboggling to me that there is one that is being selected and the one that's happening in one side somehow that signal is making it to the other side to say you don't you you can't do it this month, right? How does that happen? Fascinating. Who knows? We don't know. We have no idea how that happens.

[00:37:53] No idea. something to do with the receptors on the eggs and particular hormonal mu maybe there's some you know nerve that plays a role we have no idea actually but it is on average 50% from one side and 50% from the other side and it's a coin toss right and it's not necessarily alternating but it's on average 5050 it would be like heads is left tails is right if you throw it for enough times it's 50/50 but not necessarily back to Exactly. Yeah.

[00:38:25] Again, I I This is mindboggling to me. It's fascinating that not only it's it's mindboggling if it were just one ovary, but the fact that these things are physically, you know, a foot apart, not a foot, but half a foot apart and some signal is transmitted in this woman's body. Yep. I I mean, it's Yeah.

[00:38:46] Yeah. And we don't quite understand it. That's incredible to me. Yeah. Yeah. or you know whatever that egg that's being selected somehow develops the appropriate receptors or whatever that only it can respond to, you know, the hormones. It's not necessarily signaling to the other ones, but something is happening to that one that's being selective that's making it the so-called dominant follicle for that cycle. Yeah,

[00:39:14] I suppose that's a more likely and plausible scenario is that something stochastically triggers one and only one to develop a high enough receptor concentration for FSH or LH or something so that it becomes the only one that can rece right now. Of course, when we do invitro fertilization, we're giving much higher doses of FSH and multiple eggs are growing. So you can overcome this process and get multiple eggs to grow.

[00:39:44] Yeah. But we don't totally understand physiologically what makes just one grow each month. Okay. So let's say you do the analysis and I assume if you if there's scarring on one side but not the other, would you intervene or would you just say no, we just have to it's just going to take twice as long for one to get through? Yeah, there's still a chance to get pregnant. Although whatever process caused the scarring in the one tube probably affected the other tube as well. So just just because it's open doesn't mean that it's functioning normally. Um certainly can give give it a few months of trying. But the other issue you have to worry about is uh what we call an ectopic pregnancy. If that tube is not normal, if fertilization happens, that embryo can implant in the tube. And that's kind of a very dangerous situation because obviously the tube can accommodate a pregnancy. So usually eventually that causes pain and if it goes unrecognized a surgical emergency. Yeah. Exactly. At how many weeks of gestation is a woman typically because that's you know I did my training in general surgery. So that was one of the things we were always thinking about was ectopic pregnancies for women presenting with abdominal pain. Um, but I don't think I know the answer to this question, which is how many weeks of gestation is a woman when she's showing up in the ER complaining of abdominal pain? Usually about 6 to 8 weeks pregnancy. Two months pregnant.

[00:41:10] Right. Now, remember, we time pregnancy from like two weeks before ovulation. So, she's, you know, by the time she recognizes she's pregnant, she's already a month pregnant. Yep. So in the next month is probably the most common time where those ectopic pregnancies present. So when a woman has an ectopic pregnancy can that fallopian tube be salvaged sometimes. Sometimes if you recognize it early it can be treated either medically or surgically and that tube can be salvaged. If you recognize it late and the tube ruptures then often time the treatment is to just remove the tube.

[00:41:45] Plus especially if it's not functioning normally too. Yeah. When you remove that, let's just say it's a young woman, she's 25 years old, you you can't salvage the tube. You end up taking the tube. You're leaving the ovary, right? So, you still want her to have her endocrine system intact, right? What's happening to the eggs that come out of that tube? They just get released into the abdomen, the peritinium, and resort.

[00:42:05] So, do you tell that woman your fertility rate just went down by 50%. Kind of. Yeah. Yeah. She can still get pregnant if she has the other tube in intact, but most of the time if the egg ovulates from the right, it's going to try and go down the right side. Although there have been cases where, you know, you can ovulate from the right ovary and it can travel down. It makes its way over to the way over there. Yeah, it's rare. Wow. But it could happen. Yeah.

[00:42:32] Um, what other risks for ecto ectopic pregnancy besides former STDs that lead to scarring in the tube? uh previous surgery, pelvic surgery in particular, like a ruptured appendix or something like that. Endometriosis can cause scarring of the tubes. Those are probably the most common. Okay. Any genetic component to this? If your mom had an ectopic pregnancy or you not that we know of, let's go back to our hypothetical case here. So, woman comes in um let's just assume for the sake of simplicity, the workup on her male partner, totally fine. His his sperm are fine.

[00:43:08] Um the uh radioraph shows that she has at least to the to the eye normal fallopian tubes. Um what's the next step in the workup? So we want to assess her cycles and ovulation. So if she's ovulating regularly then you know we call that sort of unexplained. And how do you know that she is? Let's say she is that determined by the fact that she has a regular period. Does that alone tell you that? Usually, usually it would be unusual to have regular periods and not be ovulating. Um, but it could happen. How stringent is your definition for regular period? It's not 28 days necessarily. Not necessarily. Yeah, there's a range. You know, it could be anywhere from like 21 to 35 days or so.

[00:43:52] Wow, that's a pretty big range, right? Are you more So, it's Are you less concerned with the number of days of the cycle and more concerned with the fact that whatever the days are, it's just repeating over and over again? Yes. If you mean duration of the period, correct? Yeah. That's not as important as how frequently the the period is happening. You'd be happy even if it was 21 days, but it was always 21 days.

[00:44:14] That's better than it's 24, 28, 31. No, there's very there is some normal variation. So, sometimes I'll I'll see a patient, she'll say, "My periods are very irregular. Sometimes they're 26 days, sometimes they're 32. I consider that normal." Yeah. It's not okay. usually always 28 days or always 21 days. There's some normal variation. Um irregular would be you're skipping months or maybe you're getting a period every 3 months or 4 months. And what's happening in that situation in a young woman? Yeah, there there are a number of different causes. Probably the most common is something called polycystic ovary syndrome. It's a very common hormonal condition. We don't know exactly what causes it. I feel like I'm saying that a lot about women's health, right? We don't know exactly what causes and because we're not investing enough in women's research. Why do you think that is? This this this came up on another podcast um on HRT, which is another one of my big uh sort of rallying cries, which is how pathetic it is that we haven't done enough research.

[00:45:15] I mean, why why do you think this is given how important a subject this this is? You know, political reasons. I think um gender inequality, all kinds of reasons like that. Yeah. Do we have a sense objectively that there is a difference in this type of research or do we think it's just that well maybe there's equal amounts of funding but the innate problems associated with the female reproductive system or you know female health in general are so much more complicated that even at equal funding levels we're we're going to be far behind in our understanding. Yeah. No, I think it's objectively there's good data that the the funding for women's health research it's it's like 10%. It's like of the overall NIH budget for example, it's very small. If you look at reproductive health, it's even smaller. So, it's a huge issue. Let's talk about polycystic um ovarian syndrome. So, uh what's the prevalence of it in in let's say women aged call it 15 to 30. Yeah, super common. About six to eight% of women will have polycystic ovary syndrome.

[00:46:25] Most common symptoms are irregular periods. Um, also evidence of high androgen levels and that could usually present with acne or excess hair growth. We call that heretism. Um, obesity or being overweight. That's also part of the syndrome. Not everybody who has and the androgens are specifically testo.

[00:46:44] Could it be just testosterone? Just DHEA, DHT, all of the above. Yeah, both. But typically elevated testosterone from the ovaries. Yeah. Okay. So, is that the cause or the effect? We don't know. We don't know. But it's definitely seen in almost all women with PCOS that they have higher androgen levels. And why is

[00:47:07] PCOS uh seemingly also highly associated with insulin resistance? Again, we don't know exactly, but we think the androgens um play a role. We think there might be some genetic factors that play a role. I don't know that we understand why, but we certainly have recognized in the last several decades that most women with

[00:47:32] PCOS also happen to be insulin resistant. But we don't know the direction of causality. No, we know that not everybody who's insulin resistant has PCOS, of course, because not all diabetics are insulin resistant, but we also know that some women with PCOS are not insulin resistant. Correct. Probably on some level they are. Okay. But um they're they're able to compensate and certainly it's more likely if they tend to be overweight as well. So, it's definitely multiffactorial and my guess is like we're treating PCOS now more like other complex diseases like obesity and hypertension etc. There's like lots of things going on. But based on what you just said, if there is any causality between them, it's more likely that the

[00:48:16] PCOS is driving the insulin resistance than the other way around given the number of women that are insulin resistant who do not have PCOS. Yeah, that's probably true. Um so then the question is what do we need what do we need to do to treat PCOS right so depends on the goal of the patient right so if they're trying to get pregnant there's one set of treatments if they're not trying to get pregnant but they have PCOS then we usually focus on their cycles because it's generally not a good idea to go too long in between cycles because what can happen is the lining of the uterus can overgrow. If it overgrows too much, it can become what we call hyperlastic.

[00:49:00] Worst case scenario, cancer. So, you definitely don't want that. So, it's important to be shedding that lining or to be on hormonal suppression so that that doesn't happen. Um, if the goal is to treat the hyperendrogenic symptoms like the acne and the heretism, again, hormonal treatments usually effective for that. When you say hormonal treatments, you mean like spironolactone and things like that? We usually start with birth control pills. birth control pills very effective for for most symptoms of PCOS. It'll regulate the cycles, decrease androgen levels, help with heretism and acne, etc. So, let's talk about why. So, so a birth control pill is a high dose of a synthetic estrogen and progesterine. Correct.

[00:49:41] That's given 21 days and then paused for a week. I mean, meaning you take it every day, but the last week is a is a placebo. Um, so is the reason that that helps with the hyperandrogenism because it raises sex hormone binding globulin so much that it mops up all the excess testosterone. Part of the reason I'm impressed by your endocrinology knowledge. Um, yes, that's part of the reason. And and by the way, you don't you can take it that way you described where you have a a bleed every month, but you don't have to. Many people take it continuously these days, so you don't have a period at all. But then doesn't that address the issue that you were talking about or does the synthetic estrogen uh the synthetic progesterine offset the hyperlasia and then you don't care right when you take the combination of estrogen progesterone usually the lining becomes quite thin you don't have to worry about it yeah so two two mechanisms of action when you're taking those high doses of estrogen and progesterone it's suppressing the pituitary hormones namely the LH and FSH but the LH is what drives the testosterone production in the ovary so that's one mechanism them and the other one is the one you described. So the estrogen component of the pill will increase the sex hormone binding globbulin so you have less free testosterone around. So again that will help with um those symptoms we talked about. Okay. So woman with

[00:51:03] PCOS doesn't want to get pregnant just wants to reduce the androgen impact and protect her uterus. A constant o oral contraceptive is a great strategy. Is a great strategy. Yeah. There are others, you know, could be a progesterine IUD, that's a hormonally active IUD. Um, so there a number of different ones or just taking progesterone every few months that usually will help protect the lining but probably won't decrease the androgen levels. And how often do you place women who have PCOS also with insulin resistance on metformin? Do you find that or any of the other diabetic agents to be particularly useful occasionally? Yeah. And that's an important point because women as we said who have PCOS are insulin resistant which predisposes them to diabetes. So those women need to be screened periodically for diabetes and we commonly use metformin to either treat pre-diabetes or to try and prevent diabetes. So does insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes independently uh impair fertility? All things being equal, absent PCOS, that's a loaded question. Yeah. Um, in some cases, I mean, there's some data that shows that, you know, metabolic diseases or chronic diseases can impact fertility mechanisms again are unclear, but probably related to both ovulation uh, dysfunction and also endometrial receptivity. Okay.

[00:52:30] So now I assume that's the easier way to treat PCOS is the woman who does not want to get pregnant. So So now let's talk about the woman with PCOS but who is also trying to conceive, right? What is your playbook? So we always counsel these patients as well. I should mention whether they're trying to get pregnant or not especially if they're overweight or obese. Weight loss helps you know with all the symptoms of PCOS. So healthy diet, lifestyle etc. And how much of a role are GLP1 agonists playing in this now? How much more success are you having with treating PCOS that way?

[00:53:04] Yeah, increasingly. And and they're very successful as you know for weight loss and there have been some studies on PCOS patients specifically. Very effective. What? Yeah. Do you know any of those data? I'm not familiar with Yeah, they work really well just like they work in people with diabetes or people who with obesity without diabetes. Problem is you can't get pregnant while you're taking them. And the current recommendation is to stop for at least pardon my ignorance. Why? Because we don't have any data on whether they're safe. So FDA is saying when FDA I I forget the FDA's classification for this. There's like AB

[00:53:38] CX or something like that for every drug. Yes. And I haven't looked for that one specifically, but I'm sure it's like X because we have no data. Okay. So that's an important message for anybody listening. If you're trying to get pregnant, you should not be on a GLP-1 agonist because we don't understand the impact of that, right? You can be on it pre-reg, just the recommendation is to stop for at least two months. Okay? Now, having said that, there have been lots of you may have read about ampic babies like people getting pregnant on GOP1.

[00:54:06] So, there is a registry and so far to my knowledge there haven't been um reported birth defects and that type of thing, but obviously we're talking about small number of patient. Yeah, that's an interesting point. I I now that you mentioned that I I now recall hearing about that. So So presumably these are women who have taken either you know semiglutide tepatide and presumably they get pregnant either intentionally or not. Right. Um okay so that's a very interesting interesting registry to follow. Right.

[00:54:39] Right. Now of course once they find out they're pregnant usually they're usually counled to stop by. So we don't know what would happen if you continue. I don't think anybody wants to do that study at the moment. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. We certainly don't want women who are pregnant to not want to eat. Understanding that a woman who's got PCOS is going to be first counseledled to make these changes that effectively help her lose weight and increase her metabolic health. Um let's say she is somewhat successful but still unable to address the concern. Right? So luckily there are very good ovulation inducing medications available. So what we would typically recommend for someone with PCOS to help them ovulate more regularly is a medication called let the brand name is Famara and it's just a medication you take for 5 days in your cycle and then we can usually assess ovulation with ultrasound. And what does it do? Uh it basically it's category of medication called aromatase inhibitors which blocks the conversion of testosterone to right androgens to estrogen that lower estrogen somehow triggers the pituitary to increase secretion of FSH and LH and that stimulates the ovary to again get one of those follicles. And is the reason you use something like an aromatase inhibitor as opposed to clomophene or hCG is just that it's a smaller nudge and you're starting out with it? No, we used to use Clomid uh first line for

[00:56:08] PCOS, but then there was a study that came out several years ago comparing the two and show that pregnancy rates were a little bit higher with Leol. Clomid's perfectly good as well, but let's better for PCOS. So if you have access to let that's very counterintuitive. Why? Well, if you think about it, when you when you take an aromatase inhibitor, you're going to um lower estrogen, but not I mean, I guess it depends on the dose. I

[00:56:34] I guess I'm trying to think of like anastriol, which I'm more familiar with than let um I suppose if you took a milligram of anastriol every day for 5 days, you would drive estrogen down, but I didn't think you would I didn't think that that reduction in estrogen would lead to a high enough amount of releasing hormone, which is effectively what has to be happening. It has to be going up to drive the secretion of LH and FSH, right? Yeah.

[00:57:06] Yeah. That that's again that's still counterintuitive to me. I would just think that giving 50 to 100 milligrams of Clomid would have a much bigger impact on that. It also works, but yeah, according to this study, yeah, randomized control trial, head-to-head comparison showed the pregnancy rates were better for some reason with the let compared to Clommet. Okay. And um does it matter when in her cycle she takes the let? Usually it's recommended from day three to five with the first day of full bleeding. We call that day one.

[00:57:37] Yep. So early. So what if she's not on what if the whole point of this is she's not having her period. How do you then time it? We induce a period. Not a real period, but we induce a withdrawal bleed by giving progesterone typically. Okay. So you give a woman progesterone, right? And then by withdrawing the progesterone, you That's so cool. Yeah, you guys are so manipulative. I know.

[00:57:58] How much progesterone do you give? Uh, usually about 200, no 5 to 10 millig of majoxy progesterone acetate or you can give micronized progesterone for about 7 to 10 days. Only 5 to 10 milligrams of micronized progesterone. No micronized progesterone 200 millig. Okay. Yeah. So you give the full party dose of micronized progesterone for 5 days.

[00:58:20] Yeah. Mroxy progesterone acetate 5 to 10. Okay. So then um and by the way, do you have a preference for MPA versus micronized? No, not really. Okay. Is because it's such a short course. So So you give the full dose of endometrial progesterone for 5 days. Y the second you take it off, it's the withdrawal of progesterone that causes the lining to shed, right? And then we call that day one. And then you said on day five, we go ahead and start ripening the follicule, right? Ripening the follicle with the aromatase inhibitor. Three to seven. Yeah. Five days. Yeah. Okay. Wow.

[00:58:53] Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. And then we usually do an ultrasound around day 12ish and you could see one of those follicles starting to grow. Usually not not all patients will respond. So sometimes we have to increase the dose or sometimes we have to try a different medication. But most patients with PCOS will respond to that medication. So, would you say that every single woman out there with PCOS who wants to get pregnant has access to a doctor that understands what you just described and can do that for her? Or do you worry that too many women are being shunted to

[00:59:27] IVF too soon without an attempt at something like this? I I definitely think there probably not enough people who totally understand management of PCOS, especially in the context of fertility treatment. Uh, for sure. And even in the context of some of non-infertility treatment, often what I hear from patients is they had irregular periods. Somebody told them to start go on the birth control pill. They never told them why. They didn't even know they had PCOS, right? Happens to be the correct treatment. So great, but you know, they've gone years now not understanding that they have PCOS and the implications of that, which as we talked about, there are metabolic implications, etc. Uh so that's a problem. But once they want to become pregnant, very few general gynecologists are set up to be able to treat patients with either Clomid or let some of them do, but it's not like a fertility clinic with reproductive endocrinologists because we're set up to do monitoring 7 days a week and that type of things, but not everybody has access to a fertility specialist. Kind of very dependent on where you live. a little bit better now with teleaalth but um still access is you have to do the sonogram when you're doing this. You don't have to but you you want to know whether the woman's responding meaning that she's actually ovulating. There are other ways to assess that if she gets a period at the right time then she probably ovulated or if she gets pregnant of course um or you can check a progesterone level in the ludal phase the second half of the cycle and if it's elevated she probably ovulated. Yeah, we just happen to use ultrasounds just easier. And how much of what you're describing is covered with typical health insurance? Depends. Uh kind of depends where you live in the

[01:01:14] United States is very state dependent. So some states have infertility insurance mandates where your employer's insurance policy has to provide infertility diagnostic and treatment, but many states infertility is not covered. or they might just cover the testing portion but then not cover the treatment portion. So that's a huge problem. Okay. You're you're in Oregon.

[01:01:36] I'm in Oregon. And what is the what is the state there? We we don't have an infertility insurance mandate yet although we're working on it. Actually a bill in session this uh this regular session now that we're trying to get passed because you know we infertility is a disease like every other disease and we think it shouldn't matter where you live. You should have access to the appropriate treatment. So, so in our state, it kind of depends on your employer and whether they provide that particular insurance coverage. And so, if a person has health insurance that does not cover reproductive care, Yeah. how much would be the cost of what you just described, the out-of- pocket cost.

[01:02:16] Yeah. So, let Clomid are just oral medic. They're pretty cheap. Yeah. But then you add the ultrasound monitoring, that could be another $300 if you're paying out of pocket. And then if you're doing like intrauterine insemination for example, which we haven't talked about yet. No, but let's just say just what we talked about is still a really cheap treatment, right? Relatively. Yes. A few hundred dollars a month, but you know, for some people that that could be a lot. Yeah. But relative to what we're about to talk about, right? This is this is still well within the purview of out of pocket. For sure. Compared to compared to what's coming. Yep. For sure. And and so you kind of alluded to it, but I'm guessing you're saying, look, we would give this three tries.

[01:02:55] Would that be a fair assessment? So, so we'd go through three consecutive cycles of this. And it's interesting. So, so, so there's two ways that this treatment could fail, right? The first is um each time we did the ultrasound, we just didn't see an egg. So, right, we were not responding to the follical stimulation, right?

[01:03:18] Um, let's talk about what the implication is there. Alternatively, you could say, "God, three out of three months we actually got ovulation." Uh, but we didn't get fertilization, right? If you were three months of that, I assume in parallel you're doing the male workup, cuz nothing would be a greater crime than going to all that trouble and then you didn't you figured out the sperm was the problem. But let's assume you have that box checked. Would you be more inclined to continue that treatment for another 3 to 6 months?

[01:03:48] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And someone who hasn't been ovulating, they haven't tried for a year even. They haven't even met the criteria for Exactly. So, there's nothing magic about 3 months, but that's, you know, at least a check-in point where we say, "Hey, do we continue doing this or do we move on to something else?" So, if it's a young person and this is like the first time they're ovulating in their life, then yeah, we give them more time on a less invasive treatment, less expensive treatment.

[01:04:13] Okay? if they're like 38 40 uh you know we probably move on to something else. Okay. So let's go to the the the first case I described. So the you get um no ovulation. Yeah. Okay. Three times no ovulation. We're not going to waste her time anymore. But she's still young. So what what's your next step in the in the algorithm? Typically, so assuming we've tried higher doses and different medication like Clomid or whatever, still not responding, then we typically move on to a class of medication called gonadotropins or essentially FSH or follical stimulating hormone. Same hormone, not LH. You don't give hCG directly. It's a little bit of combination. We do eventually give HCG

[01:04:54] Yep. to trigger ovulation. So we could either use those medications with either timed intercourse or intrauturine insemination or with IVF. Okay, that middle option with time intercourse and insemin intrauturine insemination has kind of fallen out out of favor a little bit because those medications are very expensive require a lot of monitoring success rate with IUI or time intercourse is much lower than

[01:05:22] IVF. So we usually skip that and go directly to IVF. Okay. If you are going to use FSH and LH, give me a sense of cost. How what dose are you using of HCG? So if the plan is just for timed intercourse intraun insemination, we use maybe one to three ampules of FSH and 75 units. And the whole cycle if you include the monitoring, the IUI, etc. it could be like three or $4,000. So you can see Yeah, we're a big step up. Yeah.

[01:05:56] After a few cycles, it's almost the same cost as an IVF cycle. So you're like better off, especially if the patient wants to have or the couple wants to have more than one child. Yep. You know, the advantage of IVF is you can freeze embryos. So if you want to have two or three kids, might as well just do IVF and bank those embryos because otherwise you're going to have to do the same thing all over again for your second kid or your third kid. Yep. I see. So basically intrauterine insemination has largely fallen out of favor based on I does that also mean the cost of IVF is coming down. Is that also making it more attractive? No. So IUI is very common still. I see. Okay. But we do it um you know we were talking specifically about the patient with PCOS who's not ovulating. Right. Right. I see. Okay.

[01:06:43] Got it. Got it. But otherwise, and if you have a patient who is ovulating and has maybe unexplained infertility, tubes are open. Yeah. In this case, you don't have to use a hormone to make her ovulate. You just need an ultrasound, which is relatively cheap to know when she's going to ovulate. Yeah. We still use the medication though because we super ovulate. So, normally you just make one egg. So, when someone's already ovulating, the goal of the fertility medications is to get them to release more than one egg. So two eggs, three eggs, more eggs around, higher chance that one of them is going to be normal and one is going to fertilize. What does the graph look like of number of eggs versus probability of twins, triplets, etc. Yeah, that's one of the downsides, right? So the risk of multiples with the oral medications like Clomid or Leol uh is about 5 to 8%. So not super high, but definitely higher than if patient were to conceive without medication. So that's something we counsel them about, but it's very common as a first-line treatment to do oral medication with

[01:07:47] IUI, even in the context of normal sperm, I would say, although it's more important, of course, if there's a male component. And then if that didn't work in three cycles, then move on to IVF. And with the injectables, yeah, what is the risk of multiple pregnancies? Much higher, like 25 to 35%. Yeah. Okay. And how many eggs are typically?

[01:08:09] It depends on the dose of the medication. So of course when we're doing IVF, we want a lot of eggs. So it's 10 15 eggs next. But yeah, but if we're doing IUI, it could be like three to five eggs or it depends on the dose and depends on the age of the patient, etc. So what's fallen out of favor is injectables with IUI. That's kind of We don't do that very much. Got it. Makes sense. Yeah. back in the day when every time you were in the grocery store and you saw the cover of the National

[01:08:37] Enquirer, there was like this woman just had 47 babies. Like what the hell was going on in those eras? I think in the early days of uh IVF, well even you know before IVF when people just had access to injectables and IUI, most of the multiple pregnancies were from not from IVF, but from injectables and IUI because literally there were women having eight and nine babies at a time.

[01:09:01] Yeah. the that famous octopids case I think that was actually an IVF case. So in the early days of IVF when IVF was not very successful we had to transfer many embryos to get decent pregnancy rates and some of the time more than one would take. So the pregnancy rates were the multiple pregnancies. But you're saying in that situation they would have transferred eight and all eight took.

[01:09:23] Yeah. I'm not saying it was the right thing to do but that's what happened. Okay. one can split into two but yeah in that particular case more than the recommended number were transferred. So now there are very strict guidelines from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine which is our professional organization that almost always we're transferring just one embryo these days unless a couple says

[01:09:45] I'd actually like to have twins. Yeah, we kind of discourage that. Why? Because twins are riskier. They're riskier for the babies and for the mom. So they're riskier in an IVF setting. No, they're just riskier in general. Pregnancy is are IVF twins do they pose any more risk to either fetus or mom than naturally conceived twins? Yes, there is some data that would suggest that IVF pregnancies are more complicated have a higher risk of complication than spontaneous pregnancies. We don't know exactly why. if it's the IVF or the fact that people who need IVF have underlying conditions that may predispose them to some of these complications.

[01:10:24] Overwhelmingly, data is pretty reassuring that, you know, pregnancies do fine, the babies do fine, but we definitely know that twins, whether you're conceive them spontaneously or with IVF, the risk of almost every pregnancy complication is going to be higher. So this is the risk of preeacclampsia, help syndrome, blood clotion, hemorrhage, yes, need for a

[01:10:47] C-section, all those risks. Premature delivery. Got it. All those risks are increased. So we don't intentionally like to produce twins, although it happens sometimes, obviously. So boy, this is this is fascinating stuff. So let's I'm just trying to take this in some sort of thoughtful order. Should we should we now move to IVF or do you want to say a little bit more about IUI? We haven't really talked directly about

[01:11:13] IUI. By the way, I don't know what it is about when people say turkey baster. It makes me cringe. Like that is just such a gross image to me. So I am deliberately not going to say it other than that moment ago that I just said it. But but just so that people know what we mean by intrauterine insemination. Yes. Um just to be clear, you are not using a turkey baster.

[01:11:34] Definitely not. Okay. Thank god. most disgusting image. I don't know why I get so grossed out by that. So, can you explain how IUI is done? How um uh we've already said that with IUI you're you largely favor an oral preparation usually. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, that means so you you're using an oral set of hormones so that the woman doesn't have a massive proliferation of follicles, right? So, the male ejaculates, right?

[01:12:05] Do you want fresh semen or do you care if it's frozen? What's the difference in success? Yeah, same. Same. So, we have, you know, single women as well and female same-sex couples who would also be doing Yep. donor insemination in that case. And we don't see any difference between fresh semen and frozen semen.

[01:12:24] No. Assuming the sperm is assuming the sperm is Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So, the indications for IUI would be either that those scenarios I I mentioned, single women, same-sex couples, or if there's a couple with unexplained infertility, you just can't find a reason. So, you just want to try and sort of optimize their chances or if there's a male factor, right? So, if there's like a, you know, lower sperm count or lower motility, uh the idea with IUI is that the the female partner would typically take fertility medication to increase the number of eggs. She would track her ovulation.

[01:12:58] When she's ovulating, she would come to the clinic. The male partner would come to the clinic, produce a sperm sample. We process the sperm, which is basically, you know, we collect the best sperm in a small volume and then place that sperm directly into the uterus through the cervix using. So, the problem that you're able to overcome on the sperm side would be number and motility. Yeah. or or morphology like any abnormality in the semen analysis as long as it's not very chromosomeal severe though I mean obviously you can't overcome right right so so if the sperm are too few they don't move well enough if they're defective in most ways IVF

[01:13:40] IVF yeah more specifically Ixie where we actually which stands for intracytoplasmic sperm injection where we actually take a sperm and inject it directly into an egg so or severe male factor, that would be the recommended treatment. But if you know the sperm's a little bit low, but it's not too bad, then IUI, we would try a few cycles of that first. Okay. So, when in the woman's cycle, how many days before she ovulates, do you want to inject those sperm into the mouth of the uh uterus?

[01:14:13] Essentially, the day she's ovulating. So this is interesting to me because one of the things that I took away from the discussion with Paul last week was that if you look at the probability distribution curve of when a pregnancy occurs uh the the ejaculate enters the uterus prior to ovulation you have a I forget what he said 80% of pregnancies occur when the sperm are there prior to ovulation only 20 and I could be wrong on this I've already forgotten. I think only 20% occur post ovulation. So the tail falls off much quicker. Yes, it is true that if there are sperm around prior to ovulation, it can hang around for a while because it lives, you know, 2 to 3 days or so, whereas the lifpan of the ovulated egg is shorter. Exactly. So based on that, wouldn't it make sense to put the sperm in prior to ovulation or can you or is it just too risky to try and anticipate when that is? you know, if it's a stray couple, we'll tell them to also have intercourse every couple days around the time of ovulation. Um, but the pregnancy rates in these probably back early studies that have looked at this show that probably the highest pregnancy rate if if you do the insemination on the day, got it that you think the patient is ovulating. And we and are you doing that with ultrasound?

[01:15:32] Uh, usually LH monitoring. So patient will either monitor her urine LH and remember LH goes up just before ovulation. We typically also look do ultrasound based on the size of the follicles. We can tell we sometimes trigger ovulation with hCG which kind of simulates the woman's own LH surge. So if you want to be pretty precise, how how big a dose of HCG do you need to usually 5,000 units which is half a vial? It's a lot. probably more than physiologic but it the purpose is to cause release of the egg and then we time the insemination to happen when we think the ovulation is happening.

[01:16:14] Okay. Do you ever do the following? This is like me just thinking out the box. Get get the male to bank a ton of sperm. So take take weeks to get or if she's going to a sperm bank if it's a single or samesex couple but whatever just get multiple aloquats of semen and start in so on day one mhm insert day two insert day three give 10,000 IU of hcg insert and then day four insert in other words cover your bases and just have lots of semen sitting around and then force the ovulation like wouldn't that be just uh I mean you could do that or the couple could just have sex and and you know I think right but but but we we then introduce another variable right which is that the what if the what if the semen are what if the count is low enough because if if if he's ejaculating every day you're not having a chance to fully rebuild the supply.

[01:17:16] What if his motility is anything other than perfect or in the other case what if we're dealing with same-sex couples or a single mom? Yeah, there have been studies looking at like two IUIs compared to one. And specifically in um like same-sex couples or single women show no difference. And remember, especially in if you're paying out of pocket for all these things, it has to be worth it to Yeah. So, at some point, even if what I proposed worked better, it's going to approach the cost of of of

[01:17:45] IVF, right? like how much better and is it worth like another $400 5 days now your cost of your IUI cycle all of a sudden y $2,000 you know yeah so those are practical considerations as well so uh so feel free to partition this in any way you want uh if if you if you look at all uses of IUI what is the success rate and how or and feel free to again divide that up into different cases the pregnancy success rate really depends on the age of the female partner. So if it's a young woman in her 20s, success rate might approach success rate for natural conception, which might be 20 to 25% per cycle. But if you're, you know, if it's a woman over 35, might be 10 to 15%. If it's a woman over 40, might only be 1 to 5% per cycle. Wow. And that's because, again, it's all about the quality of the egg. So even though an egg is released, maybe two eggs are released, if those eggs aren't normal, they're not going to fertilize and implant. Okay. So we've covered a whole lot of fertility treatments.

[01:18:57] Um it seems that the likelihood that a woman who's undergone some of the things we've discussed that still ends up going down to the IVF pathway is is reasonably high. Yeah, the majority of people don't need IVF. Again, it depends on the age of the female partner specifically and what the problem is. So, let's just go sub35. Okay? So, of all women who present with defined infertility, which if she's under 35 means more than a year of regular sex and no pregnancy.

[01:19:30] Um, walk through the success rate of pregnancy by modality. So, uh, under 35, infertility for a year, how many are successful with just an oral treatment, absent IB, uh, IUI? Yeah. Again, sort of depends on what the cause of the infertility is. Is it unexplained or is it PCOS? No, let's say unexplained.

[01:19:51] Yeah, unexplained probably less than 50% will get pregnant with IUI and have to move on to IVF because unexplained to me means either there it's bad luck or more likely there's something going on we just can't figure it out and in those cases almost always IVF is going to give you a higher chance of success. Oh, sorry. Yes, that

[01:20:12] I can understand for sure. I'm I'm saying how many of them will need to get IVF or is that what are you answering that question as well? Yeah, that's what I was getting at. And um you know for PCOS their problem was they just weren't ovulating. So probably 80% of those people will get pregnant with just ovulation induction and IUI because basically is addressing it. If it's very severe male factor probably IUI it's not going to work. Yeah. You know so really kind of depends on the you know the ideology of the infertility. And so now if we talk about oh age 35 to 45. Yeah.

[01:20:48] So, and again, let's take PCOS off the table in this age group. So, let's just say we're talking 35 to 45 year old women. PCOS not an issue. And let's just also assert male not an issue. That's been worked out. Um, unexplained infertility. So, I guess now technically you would call it 6 months of of of of uh of of not getting pregnant would be sufficient. But here, how many what percentage of women will get pregnant absent an IVF strategy?

[01:21:16] So depends how long you do it for, right? So most of the time we're only doing it for three cycles because like I said, it's not cost effective to do it for longer. So I would say in that age group, probably the majority of women will likely need IVF. If they are not successful after 3 months, theoretically, if you continue doing IUI, a lot of those people will eventually get pregnant, but we tend to stop at 3 months. And so again tell me at 3 months again what percentage are going to be successful with three cycles in that age group unexplained infertility unexplained over 35 I don't know the exact number but probably under 50%. Okay but that that could be a third potentially. Yeah because the success rate per cycle is something like in that age group let's say 10 to 15%. So it's so you go one minus that number time three one minus that to the third power should be about 30%.

[01:22:13] Exactly. Yeah. Um, okay. So, now let's talk a little bit about IVF. First successful IVF baby, 1978, if my memory serves correctly. That's right. Referred to as a test tube baby, which is kind of weird because I would imagine it was in a petri dish, not a test tube, but anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Um, we've come a long way since then. For historical context, I don't know anything about that that girl, but do you do you know anything about how that was done back in 1978? Yeah, actually there's a recent uh docu drama out called Joy that goes through the whole story. Uh her middle name, I believe, is Joy. Yes. Louise Joy

[01:22:55] Brown is first Louise Brown. I believe her middle name is Joy. Got it. Um but it it's a movie about the first IVF success. Now, of course, they tried for many, many years before they had the first success that these were two doctors. And so, tell me what what I mean, maybe this is all on the docu drama and I can't wait to check it out, but what what kind of IRB approval was there? How much controversy was there around this? It must have been a huge deal. Yeah, there was a lot of controversy like you know, this was freaky. Yeah. Yeah. And this was done at the time primarily for women with tubalactor block tubes, I think. can't remember the exact details of the couple, but I believe they had tubal disease and IVF works great for tubal disease because of course you're bypassing the tubes altogether. Um, where was this done in the UK and

[01:23:45] Britain? Okay. Oh, I see. So, that so probably I I didn't realize it wasn't done here in the US. So, um, so so tell me a little bit about technologically how they accomplished it back then. Yeah, I think the first cases um they were actually doing surgery like under general laparoscopic I believe. Yeah. To um retrieve the eggs. Oh wow. And then they were combining the eggs with the sperm in the test tube putriish and then um I think they were transferring the embryo maybe back into the tube in those days or maybe through the cervix. I I can't remember the details, but yes, a lot of has changed over the last 45 years or so. Wow. Yeah.

[01:24:33] Um despite that success in 1978, what did it look like for the next 10 years? From 1978 to 1988, how prevalent was IVF? Um in terms of being I mean, I guess when did it get to the point where anybody who could afford it could access it? Much more recently. Yeah. the first IVF baby in the United States was born a few years later. I think maybe 1981 or so. Okay. In Virginia, I believe. Um, and it took like probably many decades for it to become sort of common place throughout the world. So now most countries there's you you can access

[01:25:13] IVF. Not everybody can access IVF but in some countries more than others but in you know depending on how you look at it it's kind of new and kind of not but you know 45 years but in medicine that's it's a relatively recent development and it's been only in the last maybe 20 30 years that it's become you know standard. Okay. So let's just walk through how IVF works and then we'll kind of dive into the ins and outs of of some of the nuances. So um so a woman comes to you probably she's progressed through some layers of treatment but you know you've collectively come to the decision that this is hands down the best opportunity both for success and you know risk. Um so how how does the treatment go? Yeah. So typically we do a bunch of screening tests on both partners that includes some blood tests, a semen analysis, an ultrasound to get some assessment of their egg number, the woman's egg number and then when the cycle starts takes about 2 to 3 months to complete a cycle of IVF. And when you say egg number, are you determining that through an AMH or through a physical examination of the ovaries? Both. So we do an ultrasound. We can count the number of follicles. How how small are these things? you know a few millimeters and you have the resolution to see that on an ultrasound. Yeah. Okay. And that gives you some sense of about how many eggs that particular patient will produce with ovarian stimulation. And we use AMH as a hormone. Explain what AMH is and how it works. Yeah. AMH is a hormone stands for antimmalarian hormone. It's secreted by the cells that surround the egg. So it tends to correlate with egg number. Okay. doesn't tell you anything about fertility or you know pregnancy rates or anything like that. Age is still the most important factor in that sense. But it does give you an idea. Do you have a normal number of eggs for your age? So just number. So two women that have the same number of eggs. If one woman has high quality eggs, the other woman does not, they could still have the same AMH level on a blood test, right? Okay. If they're of different ages, their success rate is going to be different. Yep. Yeah. Can you give a give me remind me the range.

[01:27:20] So uh a pre- ovulated a sort of preubescent girl who has a billion not a billion but right a million eggs but who is not fertile does she have a high or low AMH she has a higher AMH we tend not to use it in that age group because it's less reliable but in like a normal AMH would be like about two I think the units pram per deciliter I believe um less than one is considered low So, a woman who's older. But what's the difference between a 16-year-old girl who probably could get pregnant if she walked past a guy versus That never happens, by the way.

[01:28:00] Oh, okay. Good. Um, no, but if you have like a 16-year-old girl who is at the peak of her fertility versus a 30-year-old woman who is still fertile but has lost a step, like what's the difference in am? Yeah, it's a very narrow range, right? So, like above two, we consider that's probably normal reproductive. Above two is two effectively. Now it can be high too in patients with PCOS for example have very high levels okay but different thing but above two you know that's usually good number of eggs less than one low number so this is kind of a binary test you're not it's a continuum it is but you're not you're not looking at oh this this woman's 1.6 six. This woman's 1.7 this woman that looking at like you look at a

[01:28:43] TSH or something. Right. Right. And the essay is also very variable depends where you have it done or whatever. Just gives you an idea of like are the egg is the egg number average for your person's age, more than average, less than average. And it helps us because we can determine what dose of medication to use during IVF. And we also can give kind of expectation to the patient like you're probably going to make 5 to 10 eggs maybe not 15 to 20 and that type of thing. So so anyway when she's ready to start cycle everything usually starts with their period usually we depending on the age again but usually the patient starts on a couple weeks of birth control pills. What that does is kind of suppresses the ovaries because we want all the eggs to kind of grow at the same rate. Yeah. Stop the pill. Then start the gonadotropins which are the injectable. Yep. And they're injectable.

[01:29:32] They're just under skin kind of injections. So meaning hCG and FSH, not HCG, but primarily FSH with a little bit of LH. Okay. Okay. So you're on those for about 8 to 12 days. And then every few days while you're taking those medications, you have to come into the clinic for ultrasound monitoring and estradiol levels, blood levels. and we can monitor how many follicles are growing, how big they are, etc. Usually the medications are pretty well tolerated. And what dose of LH and FSH is she injecting relative to what she would normally make? Is it a 2x, 5x, 10x? It depends on the age again, higher doses for women who are older, but much much higher doses. More than 10x, maybe not quite. Okay. Maybe five. Okay.

[01:30:22] Um typical symptoms most common I would say is bloating as the ovaries get a little more enlarged. There's a small risk of something called ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome when the ovaries get a little bit too stimulated but that's exceedingly rare. Usually there's signs is happening. We can always back down on the dose.

[01:30:40] Sometimes the patient doesn't make as many eggs as we were hoping. So sometimes we have to increase the dose or change the protocol but usually we guess pretty right. And then um once the follicles are a certain size, that's how we know the eggs are mature because of course we can't see the eggs on the ultrasound. You can only see the follicles that contain the egg, right?

[01:31:00] So then the patient gets hcg which is another medication which kind of simulates her own LH surge. And the purpose of that medication, it causes the final maturation of the eggs. And if we did not do an egg retrieval, she would release all those eggs. But of course, we time the egg retrieval to happen just before the woman ovulates.

[01:31:22] So that medication is very timesensitive. And to be clear, were you only giving her FSH before or were you giving her LH as well? A little bit of LH, but mostly FSH. And why are you using LH versus HCG? Kind of just to simulate the physiologic. I didn't realize there was a difference appreciated by the body between them. I thought very similar. So we use hCG for but the body of course doesn't have hCG until the patient's pregnant. Yeah. But it works well to as a substitute for synthetic LH out there as a drug. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It it's in combined with comes in as a combination drug with the FSH. Got it. I see. Yeah.

[01:32:04] Um so how do you prevent her from ovulating while you are giving her FSH and LH and she is build and she is ripening multiple how are you preventing question there's another medication that we give it's called the G&R antagonist basically blocks the LH surge from happening until I see so when you're giving her FSH the LH that's attached to it is very very low, right?

[01:32:36] And that will prevent an ovulation. Yes, the antagonist will. Yeah. It's basically blocking the G&RH, which is another hormone. I'm surprised that the fact that you're giving her so much FSH with a little bit of LH isn't enough to suppress the G&RH, but anyway, it's it's clearly not. You wouldn't be having to give her that. Okay. So you give her a

[01:32:57] G&R antagonist and that basically puts a block between her hypothalammus and her pituitary, right? And so then now you control the switch, right? And the switch is in the mega dose of hCG which is an LH analog, right? And do you harvest the follicles in the fallopian tube or do you you go right into the ovary? In the ovaries. Yeah. Okay. So the egg retrieval is happens 2 days after the hCG trigger. Wow. Yeah, I would have thought so it would have taken two days for her to 36 hours specifically. So she usually takes it in the evening and then the retrieval is is the the day after in the morning. Okay.

[01:33:39] So woman comes into your office a day two days later. Yep. And like walk me through this. So you lay her on a table, you've got an ultrasound on her ovary and you're literally putting a needle in there. Well, first of all, she's asleep. uh fully asleep or just local fall. Yeah. Yeah. So this is done in um surgery center typically or clinic with um anesthesiologist present IV sedation prop. So it's it's like a colonoscopy or dental extraction or something. It's all done vaginally actually using the ultrasound and that day there's a needle that's guided by the ultrasound that goes through the vagina into the ovaries. So we don't do transdominal.

[01:34:19] Dumb question. Why? It seems Don't you have a much straighter shot going through the abdomen? Not really. You just don't want to go through the paranium. And there's a lot of stuff between the abdomen and the You can't just manipulate and move the bowel out of the way or something. It's much easier through the vagina like they're sitting right there. Yeah. So again, just pardon my ignorance of the anatomy because again, I'm probably still locked into the image of the ovaries being like this. But you're saying no, Peter, the ovaries are probably sitting right on top of the right on top of the top of the vagina to the side of the uterus.

[01:34:49] You just stick a needle on either side and you So literally out of the vagina, not even going through the cervix. Yep. Okay. So that still strikes me as a very delicate, complicated procedure. I mean, that's what you're trained for. Yeah. Relatively, you know, minor type surgery. But um so you how much do you have to dilate the vagina to because you're what I'm thinking about is how do you get your hand in there to guide the needle? You don't have to get your hand in there. Yeah, you should watch a

[01:35:17] YouTube video. But it's just the ultrasound probe. Yeah. And then there's a needle guide. That is the needle guide inside the probe or alongside alongside. Okay. Yeah. And the needle it's a long needle, right? So your hand's not in vagina. 16 gauge and it goes through the vagina into the over. You're doing this under ultrasound guidance. You can see exactly. So you But somebody else is obviously manipulating the ultrasound for you. No, no, you have it in your hand. It's a vaginal ultround. That's right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So, you're doing both. So, you're looking where you're going with the ultrasound, and you're using the needle to puncture the ovary, get into the follicles, and the the needle is attached to like a vacuum suction. And so, the fluid and the follicles collect it, goes through the needle into the test tube, and then that test tube is handed off to the embryologist. They look under the microscope and try and isolate the egg.

[01:36:10] Now, yeah, I'm just so full of dumb questions here today, Paula. Um, how do you prevent yourself from sucking out like 300 non-follical eggs and ultimately destroy her long-term fertility risks? Well, you only go into the the the large follicles. Yeah. Which are really the only ones you can see on ultrasound.

[01:36:32] There's gazillion of eggs in there, but you can't even see them. And you're not running the risk of sucking up those eggs. No. No. You're just going into the follicles. It looks like a How big is the ovary? The ovary is, you know, a few centimeters at that point, but each follicle is about 2 centimeters, I would say. And there might be 10. Wait, wait, wait. How is each follicle 2 cm in diameter? But you said the ovary is only a couple of centimeters. No, it's like maybe five, six, like a small like plum or something. Okay. Wait a minute. It's a threedimensional. Yeah.

[01:37:04] So, so if you have a a plum or a tangerine that is the ovary. Yeah. You're saying each follicle is 2 cm in diameter roughly. That's huge. 1.5 to two. I mean I I wouldn't have even thought it was 1 cm. How many follicles are in there? Well, on average we get 10 to 15. So, yeah, maybe the ovaries is bigger. I'm thinking more an unstimulated ovary is more like a plum when it's stimulated. More like a grapefruit. Okay. All right. Okay. I see. So, you have really good resolution of where the follicles are. Yeah. Okay.

[01:37:39] So, you're not running the risk of sucking everything out of the ovary. No. No. And we're just getting fluid, right? We're not touching the tissue of the ovary. Just the fluid and the follicles. Okay. But if the g it's only a 16 gauge needle. Yeah. Does that mean you're puncturing the follicle? Each follicle gets punctured before it enters the needle. Yeah. The fluid. Yeah. So, you do it one at a time. Yeah. You go ping into a follicle, burst it open, and the egg because a 16 gauge needle is probably only a millimeter across. Yeah.

[01:38:17] You suck out all the fluid and you don't have to take it out each time, right? You can go from follicle to follicle to follicle. You just have to go in typically twice. Once on the right and once on the left. Yeah. I mean, again, this is that that's pretty interesting that that works. Yeah. If you It's easiest maybe to just like watch a video of it and then you get the idea. Yeah.

[01:38:37] I'm just thinking of all the things that could go wrong and how like the needle could get gked up with like tissue and then you got to pull it out and put it back in. All those things can happen. You know, there's always a small risk of bleeding, small risk of infection, small risk of injury and other organs. And this is happening. You do this on both sides because presumably you're stimulating both sides. Yeah. Okay. So, how long does that procedure typically take? Half an hour. Okay. and you've got the embryologist next to you and he or she is under the microscope going check check and he or she is validating that you indeed are getting ripened eggs and they look different presumably, right? Like those are easy to identify under a light microscope. Basically, they tell us they got eggs. We don't know if they're mature yet. We know nothing about them yet. I see. But long we get the eggs, they go to the lab and then the rest of the process happens there. So at the at the retrieval, we're just aspirating all the follicles, trying to get as many eggs as possible. Okay.

[01:39:39] So then let's just assume that the woman is doing this not to just freeze her eggs, but because she wants to get pregnant. Would you then go ahead and when she wakes up have a discussion that says, "We got this many eggs. How many would you like to fertilize? How many would you like to freeze?" That discussion has happened way upstream.

[01:40:00] Yeah. Typically, we're free fertilizing all of them. Got it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There's no reason not to fertilize. Okay. So, uh tell me the time cores now and how you move from retrieval to fertilization. Right. So, then the the eggs are sitting in the petri dish in the lab. What's the medium? It is this proprietary medium that it is proprietary. Yes. Not so meaning each lab will have its own medium. There are commercial companies that make it but the exact exact components of it not entirely known. So there are different companies that have different mediums.

[01:40:35] Uh yes, I believe there's more than one. Um, but it's meant to kind of emulate the the the fluid in the tubes like where fertilization would normally happen. So, so so how much um how much of a a competitive advantage is it for an embryologist? Like how many options do they have to choose from commercially of media? I don't think there are that many media companies.

[01:41:03] Yeah, I see. Yeah. Is this a huge area of innovation in the field? It must be. Oh, really? Really? I mean, I would have guessed this would be so important. I think they got it down. Okay. Was there a day when this was a problem? I'm sure. Okay. Yeah. Maybe in the early days, but you got you've got So, the embryologist transfers this to the media. Yep. Okay.

[01:41:24] Few hours later, the eggs are inseminated. So with conventional IVF, just put a bunch of sperm in there and let the fertilization happen by itself. With Ixie or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, the embryologist takes a single sperm and injects it into each egg. And the only time again you need to do Ixie is if the sperm is so dysfunctional that it can't even on its own with no barriers make its way to fertilization when placed in direct proximity of an egg. It probably could, but maybe there's too few sperm. So, anytime there's a male factor, we tend to do Ixie. Any male factor, you go straight to Ixie. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And in fact, a lot of times it's done even when there isn't a male factor because fertilization rate is a little bit higher with Ixie compared to IVF. In very few cases, you don't get fertilization. So, you don't want to find out, oh, by the way, your sperm can't fertilize your egg. That's the whole problem all along because then you got throw away the eggs. So for again for a couple listening to us now, this is something they need to be talking about with their fertility doc which is hey do you do Ixie out of the gate no matter what or Yeah, it's a little controversial because it adds cost. How much cost? You know it's probably another,000 or 2,000 or something. No, probably a thousand. Okay. But so the data to be clear shows that Ixie and IVF have similar success rates for non-male factor. But I'm just telling you that a lot of times we're doing it anyway because we don't want to find out small very small percentage of cases that have zero fertilization. That's like not a good conversation. Catastrophic because you've lost those eggs too. Right.

[01:43:10] Right. Right. So that's part of the reason that we do it. But technically, if you just look at the data, success rate should be the same XC and conventional IVF if non-male factor. But a lot of times there's sperm factor. So we're doing XC anyway. Sorry. What do you um these go into the media sits at room temperature? I mean sorry at body temperature. Do you put it into a 37 degree oven? Body temperature in an incubator and then all the micromanipulations happening in what are the types of manipulations that are needed to foster the right environment.

[01:43:43] How much you're moving the fluid around? How often you changing the media? This is like the most important cell culture experiment of all time. Pretty much. Pretty much. And and to be fair, it's done by the embryologists, not by me. But it they um strip the eggs first, which means they remove the cells around the eggs. Then a few hours later, they're injecting the um sperm into each egg. And then the media these days may or may not get changed over the the five or six days that we culture the embryos trying to like not have to take the embryos out of the incubator if we don't have to kind of thing. So by the next day usually we look at the embryos to see or the eggs to see if they're fertilized. Usually about 70% of the eggs fertilized. So let's say we get 10 eggs you can expect maybe seven of them will be fertilized. And now there's seven embryos. So we discard the unfertilized eggs, continue to culture.

[01:44:42] And you can tell that grossly or are you having to move them under a microscope at this point? Under a microscope. Yeah. And then we culture them in the petri dish at this point. Are they all in one dish or are you separating them? They're in one like droplet of oil and there might be more than one droplet in each dish. H how how are embryologists trained? What's the How does one become an embryologist? Yeah. Well, there's no clear pathway and there's not not like a whole bunch of embryology schools. Uh, so that's a problem. But if I wanted to be an embryologist, what would I do?

[01:45:18] Mostly like an apprenticeship almost. You might start working in a fertility clinic and do some basic kind of lab prep work initially. Most of them have some sort of, you know, undergraduate science background. Uh, but you don't have to. But anyway, you gain experience in the lab and then eventually you become a junior embryologist. So, it's like a mentorship program. How many years would it take from if I started tomorrow working as a lab tech who was doing nothing but cleaning petri dishes?

[01:45:48] How many years would it take for me to be the head embryologist in your lab? It might take four to five years. It take a while. Yeah. Now, there's some formal schools available as well that with online programs, with some in-person components. I mean, this seems, and not to take anything away from what you do, but you could have the best fertility doctor. If they don't have a good embryologist, you're not going to have great success rates. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I would say the lab is almost more important than what we do. Yeah. Because there's just more variability. But, um, luckily, you know, at least in the

[01:46:22] United States, the labs pretty are pretty good. Um, but yeah, that's like the like think of all the ways. I mean, I I because I used to work in a lab. Yeah. I the I just think I just can think of a hundred ways that could get screwed up, contaminated, jostled, like all these things that can go wrong.

[01:46:41] Super important. Yeah. So, most of the success rate probably more related to what happens in the lab than anything I do or one of my physician colleague does. I guess the question is how does a well let's finish the story and then we'll come back to this. Okay. So so how many day you go to 14 days of this? No no no five five days five to six days and depending if we're doing a fresh transfer or freezing the embryo. So a fresh transfer wheat. So you'll do both, right? We do both. Yeah. Although these days most of the time we're freezing because you're doing genetic screening.

[01:47:14] Because we're doing genetic testing, right? So on So let's go through that example then. So, we're culturing these embryos in the petri dish for 5 to 6 days. Then we look at them again. The ones that have made it to that stage, which is usually only half of them. So, remember you're seven now. Maybe there's three or four. So, what explains that?

[01:47:33] So, most likely the ones that didn't make it are the chromosomally abnormal ones. Remember we talked earlier about those ones not making it. And the reason it's only half is because by definition you're doing this in women who tend to be a bit older. Like if you were doing this in if not that one would do this but just as a thought experiment if you did this exact thing in 18year-old girls presumably you'd have a much higher success rate.

[01:47:59] Yeah. The blast we call that the blastilation rate is a little bit higher in younger women. Al also you have more eggs and more embryos of course, right? Yep. Um but yes, the blastulation rate the the ones that make it to day five or six is a lower percentage the older a woman is because a higher proportion of those embryos are just going to be abnormal. So the ones that make it to day five or six are more likely to be normal but not necessarily normal. So we can also do genetic testing on those embryos which involves biopsying them. So we take a few cells from the embryo, freeze the embryos. So yeah, let's talk about that. So how many cells do you have at 5 days? Again, uh altogether you might have like 60 to 80 cells. Okay. So you take two or three of those. Five or six. Five or six. Yeah.

[01:48:48] And they're from the perimeter, the trophoblast, right? So the not the embryo directly, but the cells surrounding the embryo. You still have full genetic material there. Yeah. And so you do that for each and every egg. And then you every embryo, sorry. And then you freeze each embryo. Yeah. Tell me what the freezing process is like. So the freezing process uh these days is one called vitrification it's called. And it's like this special kind of freezing that doesn't result in ice crystals. So So how do you do that? And there's a process it happens in the lab.

[01:49:23] There's a machine that does it that lowers the temperature. And uh so the rate at which they lower the temperature, right? It's rapid. Okay. So it's like a liquid nitrogen basically. Right. As opposed to old days when we did slow freezing. So it becomes like a glassless glass-like state without crystals. But the it works really well and the survival is really high. And then you store them at what temp? Like liquid nitrogen temp. Yeah. Yep. So it's not like in your freezer. No. Yeah. At home. And and then how long does it take typically to get the genetic results back? Uh typically within a week or two.

[01:49:59] Okay. Yeah. And what depth of genetic testing is being done here? Are you doing whole genome sequence or are you just looking at a handful of snips that are pre-identified as the ones that matter? Yeah, good question. So, it's evolved over time and I should say it's still very controversial because there's always a risk of harming the embryos.

[01:50:23] You're only looking at a few cells. So, is it really representative of the embryo? I mean we do it a lot and the data definitely shows that if you transfer a normal embryo it has a very high chance of implanting but the issue is recently has been are we discarding embryos that are maybe normal uh because we think they're abnormal based on the genetic testing but the genetic testing is flawed. It's a whole So presumably genetic testing is really easy to identify annuployy that's chromosomeal analysis is trivial it's geared up to do that right okay right so most of the time we're using something called next generation sequencing which is you know very high level sequencing but it's not whole genome sequencing so you're getting targeted yeah and you're looking mostly at chromosomeal abnormalities unless you know that the couple's a carrier for some genetic mutation that you also want to screen for. Yeah. So, let's say one of the parents, well, this would be a bad example, but cystic fibrosis like let's say both patients. So, both of them have are a carrier for CF. And so, there's a one in4 chance that you're going to get two copies of CF. So, then you're looking directly for the CF.

[01:51:36] Exactly. Betathal. Exactly. Uh cickle cell. There's a whole bunch of them. Right. And part of the screening, we didn't mention it, but most people doing IVF will get carrier screening to see if they're carriers for any genetic mutations. Usually, that's a pretty common scenario where you have two people that are CF carriers, neither of whom have CF. They most of those people would say, I'm going to do IVF because I don't want to take the chance that my kid Okay. And then what about people who come in and say, "Oh, but you know, we're one of us is each an APOE E4 carrier and so we're each a 34 and we would really like to not select a 44 as an example. Is that so one is that are you able to look at that and and two, you know, does that start to cross an ethical line?" Yeah, it's a little more controversial when you're talking about nondeterministic adult consequence genes with variable penetrance, right? You may or may not Yep. get Alzheimer's or whatever it is, right? So, it's a little more controversial, but we're kind of going in that direction. I would say we're we're definitely going probably in the near future towards whole genome sequencing where we can pick up even mutations that happen denovo, what we call denovo, right? Like you might not be a carrier, but it might just happen randomly. So, you could pick up some disease that way. And then what you're talking about is like like BA, you know,

[01:52:58] BA. Yeah. You know, often we know ahead of time the patient's carrier, we can test for it. But LPA for cardiovascular disease. Yeah. There's a whole bunch of things, right? So people are starting to talk about polygenic screening of embryos, but it's a little more controversial because the science isn't quite settled yet. And um it's one thing if you're already doing IVF and we have these embryos here and we're just going to add another layer of testing like which one of these embryos is at higher risk for like whatever diabetes or hypertension. Whole different story if you're saying oh you should do IVF because of because we want to like you know get the embryo with the lowest risk of these diseases. So we're not quite there. This is very controversial plus it's expensive and you know we already talked about cost barriers and there are ethical issues as well. Are we now you know is it a form of you know positive eugenics and that type of thing. So um that particular type of testing is is still controversial but antloy testing testing for chromosomal abnormalities is pretty routine pretty standard. Now, there was a day when people weren't doing any genetic testing and the embryo selection was just based on morphology, right? Yes. Yeah. Which is back in the days where we had to transfer more than one embryo because we didn't know. You could look at two embryos and they could look both normal, but one of them is chromosomally abnormal and one's not.

[01:54:23] You can't really tell. So, we had to transfer more embryos to get decent pregnancy rates. Now with genetic testing because we know that a chromosomally normal embryo has a pretty high chance of implanting not 100% like maybe 70 75%. So there's still reasons there for some reason that's not the whole story right because even chromosomally normal embryos sometimes don't implant. So yeah that's lower than

[01:54:47] I would have guessed is it 70 to 75% for something that's chromosomally normal I would have guessed at that stage given all the selection that's taking place. And um what is the concordance between chromosomally let's go one step further chromosomally genetically normal and good morphology how much how concordation there's good correlation yeah we use both right so how but so so if there's if one of if that's if there's discordance there which one are you relying on or are you discarding unless you have concordance that's positive for both you know in reality the ones that have poor morphology aren't even frozen or biopsied. They're discarded because we know selected out.

[01:55:31] Yeah, you're selected out. So, there might be a little bit of difference in morphology between the ones that you've actually decided to freeze and biopsy and keep and but it and you presumably have the genetic testing on all of them. You would preferentially of course transfer the ones that are chromosomally normal. Even if the morphology grade is a little bit lower, you never transfer.

[01:55:52] So you have so we've we've selected out bad morphology. So let's just say you're you know you harvested 15 um you fertilized 10 seven had good morphology. Six came back genetically good. Okay. Those would be reasonable numbers. Yeah. The six out of seven is high. Yeah. So so five came back genetically good.

[01:56:17] Let's say in a young person. Yeah. So you got one3 onethird of what you harvested you could implant. You're saying each of those is 70 to 75% success rate. And yet you would only implant one at a time. Yeah. Which is interesting because if you implanted two, let's do the math. You're talking about 50% chance. That's right. I was going to say twins. Yeah. Which is high. Too high. We just can't take that risk.

[01:56:44] Yeah. I mean, you know, obviously, you know, we believe in patient autonomy. Patient usually gets to make that decision, but but you're you're going to make the case for why that's not not a great idea. Yeah. You want a healthy baby in the end. You want a healthy mom. Yep. Okay. So, now let's talk about um now it's time to implant. So, how does that process work? So, that process is u much less complicated but equally important. Um so, usually does it's timed, right? It has to happen at a certain time in the cycle. So we either use the woman's natural cycle to time it and time it at the time that implantation would normally occur which is like the second half of the cycle or we use what we call a controlled or programmed cycle where we basically give the woman the hormones and then again time the transfer to happen at a specific time. Um the actual process kind of like a papsmear. It's basically doesn't require any anesthesia or anything. We do do it under ultrasound guidance. So, abdominal ultrasound. We thaw one of the embryos, draw it up in a little catheter with a little syringe on the end, place a speculum in the vagina, and then just pass the catheter through the cervix. And we're looking on the ultrasound for the placement. And where are you implanting it? About 1 and a half centimeters to 2 centimeters from the top of the uterus. So, a few centimeters through the cervix.

[01:58:07] And how do you make sure it doesn't come out? I mean, you can't, but it doesn't usually. You put it in there kind of. It's like I describe it kind of like more like peanut butter in there. It's not like you stand up and it comes out and stay. What's the total volume you're injecting? Like 50 microL like really small. Okay. Yeah. And what what is the inside of a uterus look like at that stage? because you've you've timed it so that this is a uterus that doesn't have a lining yet, right? Like it does have a lining. How thick is the lining? It's about seven to 10 millimeters, but it's going to get a heck of a lot thicker.

[01:58:46] So, it's it's still it's it's only this is technically only about 14 days past her period. So, or are you doing it artificially more into the ludal phase? So it's roughly, you know, 7 days or so after ovulation, right? So the lining is thickened already. Okay. Yeah. And that's one of the things we check with ultrasound before we do the transfer to make sure the lining What does that what does that I mean what does it actually look like? Is it like is it tent tentacle fingers or on the ultrasound which is how we assess it? It it basically the two walls of the uterus are you know opposing each other. It's not like you can see it's a potential space potential space. Exactly. And then there's on on the ultrasound the lining has a different echo density than the the wall itself. Right. Right. So we can measure the thickness and basically the combined thickness of the two posing walls has to be at least seven millimeters or so. And if you get in there and do the ultrasound and it's not, are you going to come back and try to do it another day? And have you lost that egg because it's been thawed or can you keep that egg in the medium now? We essentially assess the lining a week before we do the transfer. I got it. So we would not thaw the embryo unless we were sure the lining it's go time. Yeah.

[02:00:09] Okay. Yeah. Cuz once it's thawed, I mean, you can refreeze it, but No, I'm sure probably doesn't do as well. Not a good idea. Okay. So, I see. So, once you put that egg in there, embryo, sorry, that embryo in there closer to the top of the uterus. It's in that it's it's largely being held in place by the opposition of the wall and then are you done or are you still doing ongoing hormone therapy? Um, sometimes we give supplemental progesterone. That's another hormone that helps maintain the pregnancy. And then usually, you know, 12 to 14 days later, the patient has her first pregnancy test. Hopefully, she's pregnant. We usually follow the pregnancy for the first few weeks before and then she transfers to her non IVF midway. Yeah. Wow.

[02:00:49] Um I It's just kind of amazing that this all works. Yeah. It I've been doing it for 30 plus years and I still find it fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, how often does a woman go through all of this and for whatever reason you can't get enough eggs or the eggs you get are not chromosomally normal and her next alternative is an egg donor? Yes, unfortunately more often than we would like. Uh again it depends on the age of the patient but sometimes you know patients do multiple cycles maybe they don't have any normal embryos or maybe even the normal embryos we're we transfer don't take or number of different things can happen. Um so the most common reason someone would need an egg donor is usually maternal age. So, someone who's older and has tried to get pregnant with her own eggs, hasn't worked for whatever reason, and then now she's looking at egg donation as an option. That works really well. So, usually egg donors are young women in their 20s, early 30s sometimes, and they produce multiple eggs. And then the age of the uterus doesn't seem to matter as much. So, the success rate with donor egg is is quite high. It's about 70 75%.

[02:02:08] Whereas, you know, for women over 40 using their own eggs, success rate might be 10 to 20%. Percle. Yeah. Wow. 10 to 20%. Yeah. For a 40-year-old woman. Yeah. Untested embryos, right? Or they might not get any embryos, right? Normal embryos. Yeah. I did not really realize it was that low. Yeah. Um, how many times can a young woman be an egg donor before you worry about is there anything you worry about if you're counseling these women? Because I assume the same women are coming to you as egg donors. Yes, sometimes people do it multiple times. Sometimes they just do it once. Um, does it pose any risk to the egg? The they're essentially undergoing the IVF process themselves or at least the first half of it. So there's the risks we talk about ovarian hyper stimulation which is rare risks associated with the retrieval anesthesia but is there anything that like restricts her ability to get pregnant later in life? No barring any complications from major complications that it does not seem to impact future fertility. What is the typical fee for that's collected by an egg donor? It's usually between5 and $10,000 depending on where you live. Okay. So that's a that's a lot of money. I mean there's there's real incentive to do that. Yeah.

[02:03:26] Period. Yeah. Um and so a woman could do that a couple times a year if she wanted to. So the guidelines up to six times. Six times a year. No, six times lifetime. Oh, okay. So up to six times. Yeah. And that's a little bit arbitrary, but you know, the the professional society has decided that's kind of a

[02:03:44] Yep. You know, good number of times. Most people don't do it that many times. they might just do it once or twice. And so what is what do you and maybe you don't do this I I don't know but but how women who undergo egg donation um or IVF via egg donation what do you discuss with them about the appropriateness of timing in explaining to the children that they have a different genetic mother? Mhm. Um so, you know, before anybody does egg donation or even before they donate eggs, we always have them meet with one of our um mental health therapists just to as a cycle educational visit to go over these types of questions and best practices around what what to tell the child, when to tell the child. General rule is, you know, tell them early and tell them often. So you you basically want to normalize the thing and you definitely want to be the ones to tell them and you don't want them to find out some other by some other means like somebody contacts them on 23 and me or something like that. Um and early means what? Like telling them before they understand reproduction like how what are you telling them? I mean again it's a little outside my area of expertise but when they're quite young like it could be like four to six years of age or it might depend on the child and you know how mature they are etc. Um but basically and there's different ways to introduce the concept. I mean obviously if it's um you know a same-sex couple or if it's a single person might happen earlier as opposed to a a straight couple. If someone's listening to this and they're trying to figure out how to select a good IVF clinic, what what what are the things they should be looking for? Because I would have to assume that it's like any other field of medicine, right? Not all doctors and not all clinics are created equal.

[02:05:47] And just because you see a lot of advertising doesn't tell you anything, right? So, so, so in other words, you you're going to have to become a very very intelligent consumer. For most people, this will be the single most expensive outofpocket health care expense they have. Yeah, that's true. And so, it's not just that it's the most expensive health care decision they're ever going to make. It might be one of the most consequential as well. For sure. And yet I I mean I know what I suggest to people when someone says, "Peter, you know, my wife and I are thinking about getting IVF. What do you think?" I just go down the rabbit hole of like here's a hundred questions I would ask. Yeah. Um and it usually begins with tell me your success rate individually. I don't care about the national success rate. It means nothing to me. So So how would you counsel someone who's trying to come up with their checklist of questions to ask?

[02:06:44] Yeah, there's a good it's a good question and you know these days is a little bit easier because obviously there's the internet and there's suggested questions online you could look at um there it's true there is some variability amongst clinics although there's a lot of consolidation happening in the field as well so a lot of the you know practices are becoming common to to most clinics um but some of it is practical right like which clinics are close to where you live because as you have to go and get these ultrounds yeah you got to go in every few days.

[02:07:15] So, you can't be going to another state. You know, most people can't. But in most major cities, you have multiple options. In ma in most major cities, that's true. Yeah. Um so, you're right about individual clinic success rates, although technically it's hard to use those to compare them to each other because you don't necessarily. So, how do you normalize it to Right. Right. So one thing for sure look at the the success rates and we're one of the few fields of medicine where actually you can get clinic specific success rates. So you mean publicly it's available or it's available. Yeah. So where do you find it? Well the

[02:07:53] CDC until recently there is a law actually that says you have to report every IVF cycle and the success rate that was passed in the '9s. So because of that the CDC tracks this although all the people that work in that department were fired recently. So we don't know what's going to happen with that. But also our professional organizations called the Society of Assisted

[02:08:13] Reproductive Technology has a website. It's called sart.org is the URL. And all the clinics in the US or most of them are on there and they have to report their success rates and they're published every year. There's usually like a two-year lag because the babies have to be born and everything. So I would send people to that website first.

[02:08:33] Look at the clinics in your area. look at the success rates keeping in mind right that populations might be different in in different clinics I probably would go to a clinic that does a sufficient volume you know you have to do at least 100 cycles I would say but you know ideally more than that your your clinic has how many doctors our clinic has about six doctors and how many total cycles do you guys do a year we do like 6 to 800 retrievalss a year there's a lot of variability there's some clinics that do thousands. There are some that do like 50. So that would be one factor that I think is important.

[02:09:11] Just volume like And you have how many embryologists? We have something like nine embryologists. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. There is a shortage of embryologists, you know, nationwide and reproductive endocrinologists because the demand for IVF is going up, right? So I would definitely look at the clinic success rates, look at the volume. Um the other thing, you know, with the internet especially, you can look at patient reviews, you know, word of mouth and um got to take those with a grain of salt, right? Yeah. They tend to be negative selecting. So, not everybody who has a great experience necessarily going to post it on Reddit, but everyone who has a bad one does. Yeah. Yeah. So, you have to take that with a grain of salt, but there are objective ways. And you can also like interview your your doctor.

[02:09:54] Yeah. what are questions you should be asking of the doctor that are independent of the objective metrics that we might have just discussed? Um, you can ask about their sort of philosophy about protocols about things like add-ons like genetic testing. You know, for example, it's like are you a clinic where everybody is encouraged to do a genetic testing? You know, that's not necessarily the clinic I would choose, right? you you talk to the patient about the pros and cons and you let the patient decide and we do a lot of genetic testing so it's not like I'm against it or anything but you know you want to get a sense of the vibe of the clinic you know are they just you know interested in in money not that doctors ever think like that but you know what I mean uh so sometimes it it takes having a consultation with one or more clinics to to see where you feel more comfortable you know I'm a little bit biased towards some academic centers just because our our missions include like education and and research etc. Uh but there's several very excellent private clinics as well.

[02:11:02] What would be some red flags if you're going through this process? Um and by the way, do you have a is is how much of a delta is there in cost in within a same city or or do prices tend to converge within a given geography? Yeah, within a given geography they're pretty similar and it's not cheap. Yeah. So, what are we at today? Fully loaded cost.

[02:11:23] You know, an IVF cycle is probably around $20,000 per cycle. But that doesn't include genetic testing or does including genetic testing? Yeah. Per cycle. But how does that compare to 20 years ago? Is that more or less inflation? Prices like most things have gone up. It has. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, and all it I guess it should go up just based on the cost of labor that goes into all these things. And there's, you know, even though the genetic testing's coming down. Yeah. Innovations and things like I you're right. Like you think as volume goes up eventually prices go down, but that quite hasn't quite happened. As new things get at it, then it just tends to become more expensive. And most people are probably still paying out of pocket. Most people are not getting this covered by insurance. Again, depends where you live. Yeah. But across the country.

[02:12:06] Yeah. And I think there are now There are 24 states that offer some kind of fertility coverage. About 15 of them include IVF. So most of the You're right. Most places you're paying out of pocket if your employer doesn't happen to offer infertility insurance coverage. Yeah. Um so red flags, you know, again, the communication with the clinic. So a lot of your experience is going to be communicating with nurses and you know

[02:12:39] Yeah. just setting up appointment coordinators. Yeah. So you you know you want to get a sense of what that is like because that could be stressful if it's not smooth and often times you know our our clinic included sometimes it's not smooth. I mean there have been you know some things we try and do like texting and apps and things to make the communication you know easier and um but doesn't always work the way it's supposed to kind of thing and you want to get time with your doctor. So some clinics you hardly ever see the doctor and you see maybe the ultrasographer.

[02:13:13] Not that that's bad there, you know, but it's kind of nice. Some patients prefer to have that sort of more frequent interaction with their actual. So there's probably a sweet spot in volume where you it's probably an inverted U-shape where if they're too low, they don't have the reps. If they're too high, it's a bit of a sweat shop and a factory and you you want you want in the middle there. Um, okay. Let's let's pivot now and talk about a few other things. So what's on the horizon medically for extending fertility? So there's a there's a study going on at at uh Cornell or Columbia um that's looking at the use of rapamy to extend fertility in women. Now I have to be honest with you I I there was a day when I knew what the study was and what the inclusion criteria were. I I I

[02:13:56] I don't at the moment. I'm I'm assuming you are more familiar with this than I am. uh what is the question that is being asked and how is it being asked in this study? Yeah. So there's a lot of interest in extending fertility right like up until you know 100 years ago women were basically dying at 50 is the average age of menopause. So it's it's a kind of a recent phenomenon that we're actually living a third of our lives you know postmenopause but and fertility starts to decline way before you go through menopause. So there's a lot of interest in trying to extend fertility.

[02:14:28] Now, of course, egg freezing, which we haven't talked about yet, um is one of the ways you can extend fertility, and it works pretty well as long as you're young when you freeze your eggs. Um but again, it's a relatively recent phenomenon. Not every it's not you're not usually covered by insurance and it's expensive, etc. So, it's not the answer because you're paying basically half the IVF cycle to harvest and then you're paying to freeze. Yeah. Exactly.

[02:14:53] What's the cost of freezing? About $1,000. Well, $10,000 for the And then about $1,000 a year for storage. And you're recommending that women, if if a woman came to you at 20 and said, um, you know, I'm going to I just want to double down on my career right now. Uh, I want to do X, Y, and Z. I think I want to have kids. I at least want the optionality. When should I freeze by?

[02:15:18] Are you going to just say do it now because No. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't recommend all women in their 20s freeze their eggs because most of those eggs will never be used. So, you'd be doing it for nothing because most of those women will probably not need IVF and get pregnant spontaneously, right? Got it.

[02:15:32] Okay. The sweet spot we think is like early to mid30s. That's where it makes the most sense like because you're about to kind of get to the probability cliff where it starts to really decline. Okay. Right. And if it doesn't, if you think you might want to have kids, but you're not in a place in your life where you think that's going to happen in the next few years, then doing it early to mid-30s is is probably the time where it's most cost effective. Very high likelihood that you will use them. If not for the first kid, maybe for the second kid. Um, and you know, it might be worth spending $10,000 and $1,000,000 a year. And do you freeze them? You freeze every egg you retrieve?

[02:16:16] Only the mature ones. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And what's the for a typical 30 year old um you're going to get what we talked about earlier? Probably 10 to 15 per cycle. Sometimes more, but that's And how many do you recommend a 30 year old do? Yeah. So, there's some calculators online. So, the younger you are, the fewer eggs you need because more of them are going to be normal. So someone in 30, you know, I think 10 to 20 would give you a decent chance of success. No guarantees. There's never any guarantees. But even, you know, studies show that even if people use those eggs and then are not successful, the fact that they did something proactively, there's some psychological benefit in doing that. So even if you know, ultimately doesn't work out or you don't end up using them. Um but at that age maybe 10 to 20. Obviously if you're you know as you get closer to 40 you might need 20 to 40 or 50 which is not practical for most people right because you can't do that many cycles and it's expensive and there's risks involved. So so I think egg freezing is a great option for for women. I also think as a society we should try to make it easier obviously for women to have kids during their peak reproductive years in their 20s and 30s. It's a whole different question, but I think having options is is a good thing. So, back to the rapamy question, they're basically saying, look, is there a way that we could push that out a little bit? And so, um, how is the study testing this? Yeah. So, um, rapamy, as some of your listeners may know, is kind of used in other sort of anti-aging type context. So the there's some animal data that shows that maybe rapamy might extend fertility in that remember this the egg cell death that we talked about earlier by like preventing that to some degree so that the eggs last longer and you're fertile for for more years. So there's some data in like mice primarily there's some data show that it's not helpful as well. So the the data I would say is mix in animal models and the study at Colombia is actually trying to test it in humans. So believe it's a few months study where they're giving relatively low dose of rapamy. I forget exactly maybe 5 milligrams daily.

[02:18:35] And then daily not weekly. I think it's daily. Okay. But I'm 100% sure. We we'll we'll we'll pull it up and put it in the show notes. I should have known this. Yeah. Yeah. And then I think their outcome marker is AMH I believe which is that hormone. Um, so I don't know. I'm not It's a relatively inexpensive study.

[02:18:53] They're not they're not invasively looking at follicles. And because what you'd have to believe then is in just a period of a few months, you could pick up a signal of more or less AMH reduction, right? And even if you can, like what does that mean really? you know, AMH is so this this study could be negative and it won't if the study is positive, it's interesting. If it's negative, it probably doesn't tell us much, right? If it's only three to six months, right? Right. To really do the study, I mean, you need like a few years, right? You need pregnancy outcomes or at least um you know, menstrual, you know, menopause, age of menopause. So, that would take for a long time and you'd have to take it for many years. probably, right? Yeah, that's going to be a really difficult question to answer in in humans. Yeah. And you know, I'm again because of the animal data not being consistent. You know, some some studies show, yeah, maybe it's helpful, but other studies show that it might be actually harmful because of the way it acts as being immunosuppressive and things. So, I certainly for any listeners trying to conceive, I would not recommend rapid. But yes, I'm I'm curious about um the data coming out of

[02:20:10] Columbia and other studies. Are there any other things that a woman can do to maximize her fertility beyond let's we've already addressed sort of PCOS, we've already addressed kind of the metabolic stuff, but um you know we hear things all the time like stress, sleep, I mean these things seem self-evident. Um, but what what would be kind of the most common things you would be saying to a woman who is otherwise experiencing iatrogenic, for lack of a better word, uh, infertility. Yeah, I think all those things are important like lifestyle factors. They're rarely the sole cause of infertility, but can they can certainly exacerbate infertility as well as any other disease. So I think the the lifestyle factors that um promote health are generally the same lifestyle factors that promote fertility. So healthy diet um you know avoiding is there anything we can say more on that? I mean it's it's a like what you know what what is a healthy diet as it pertains to fertility? Is it different? Right? Does a does a woman who's getting ready to to conceive, does she need more fat in her diet, for example, like Yeah. Yeah.

[02:21:27] Yeah. As you probably know, the data on on diet, it's not great, right, for anything, especially not fertility. So, I would say there's very little evidence that there's a particular diet that's good for fertility that's different than what's good in general. So, for most of my patients, I recommend the

[02:21:46] Mediterranean diet. That diet is palatable most people and uh has fair amount of evidence that you know it's reasonably healthy and that's like a lot of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, protein mostly from you know fish and olive oil and those types of things. So it's not that different from what I would recommend for for anybody. By the way, I think I said iatrogenic. I meant idiopathic, but you know what I meant I think when I answer the Yeah. So, um, what about supplements? I'm sure you get asked this question all the time.

[02:22:20] There's no shortage of over-the-counter supplements, right, that that people, you know, report increased fertility. Um, I get asked these questions all the time and have blank stairs because I don't know. Is there anything you can point to? And and I love frameworks. So maybe one framework is are there supplements that correct legitimate deficiencies like vitamin D or B vitamins where we could make a case that supplementing with these things happen?

[02:22:47] And I'm not I'm talking beyond just the prenatal vitamins that are obvious and necessary. We'll leave that to the side because it's so self-evident. Yeah. uh versus supplements that are kind of more grabbag mystery supplements where you're not actually correcting some obvious deficiency but we think it might increase fertility. So the data around supplements even you know less robust than the data around diet I I would say um yes if you're correcting deficiencies

[02:23:12] I think you can make a case for that. So was you know a lot of women reproductive age women are iron deficient for example and they should they might need to be on iron supplements. Uh you mentioned prenatal vitamins. Obviously folic acid is important for anybody trying to get pregnant. Um people who live in

[02:23:29] Portland, Oregon like I do, we tend to be vitamin D deficient. So I usually recommend vitamin D for people. U but other supplements specifically for fertility. The ones I most commonly hear about are things like CoQ10 or uh DHEA is another one. And there's some data that it might be helpful. Again, it's not very robust. DHEA, DHEA, which just increases endogenous testosterone production, improves egg quality. Like, who knows how it works.

[02:24:01] Yeah. I mean, the data isn't great. So, I don't want might improve libido maybe. I think people have studied that. It doesn't work so well. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it is a weak androgen. You're right. But, um, yeah, the data is not very promising. But, so for most of these things, you know, the data is not there and probably will never be there, right? because there's centers aren't there to do those studies. So it probably doesn't hurt though and so I'm I'm you know relatively supportive if a patient wants to take CoQ10 there's some data around it. Sure. And do you think it's just psychological where No. If they if they take it and they feel that they're doing something better, it reduces their stress around it like because for me I I

[02:24:38] I can't help but think that stress has such a negative impact on fertility and on many aspects of health, but it's so difficult to quantify, right? Like we can't act, we don't have a biioarker for stress. Even measuring cortisol doesn't actually tell you anything about the experience of stress. And so I I just think so many negative health outcomes are a result of it and therefore anything that a person can do to improve their stress. Uh I I agree with you and if taking supplements helps with that, sure, I'm all for it. Yeah. I'm not advocating that we should be going crazy on it with no evidence, but but I I just

[02:25:12] I wonder if any of the efficacy of those things is mediated through that reduction of stress possibly. Yeah. Uh and as long as it's not harmful, that's you know, great. So, and when we say the data is in there, it's just because it doesn't mean that it doesn't work. It's just nobody's shown one way or another whether it works, right? So, it's quite possible CoQ10 has some effect that we don't know about. And you know, my feeling is if I don't think it's harmful and you know, patient wants to take it, maybe helps with their stress. Sure, I

[02:25:40] I'm for that. Other things, you know, stress every almost everybody has some degree of stress in their lives, right? Like some more than others, unfortunately. But it's really hard to get rid of all the stress. Like it's not helpful to tell a patient, well, you know, you just need to be less stressed out. Like, okay, now what? But, you know, finding ways to cope with the stress is really what we're talking about. And that can be different for different people. For some people, it could be exercise, for some people it could be meditation, for some people, you know, whatever mindfulness, whatever it is. But definitely, I think it it's important. same as sleep and um we talked about diet you know exercise is is important and do you caution women or do we know anything about too much exercise for women who are trying to conceive I mean we certainly hear stories about you know college athletes and women who are doing a lot are actually having difficulty even maintaining a a regular menstrual cycle so if you if you're dealing with a with a woman who's when you're taking that social history and you're trying to understand what are what are some clues to you that her exercise might might actually be too much uh and that might be impacting her fertility. Right.

[02:26:51] Right. So extreme exercise can be associated um with fertility issues. Although I think for for most patients the benefits of exercise as we know Yeah. But how what what is extreme for this? So if it causes any change in a person's cycle so for some of the most more extreme athletes sometimes they'll their periods will stop altogether. Uh there's a condition called reds. It's relative energy deficiency in sport. And basically the body is very smart. If it thinks like there's not enough energy around to support a pregnancy because we're expending it all on this exercise, we're just going to like shut the whole thing down. And it works really well, but the patient stops menrating. So obviously they're going to have difficulty getting pregnant if they're not ovulating. If you're not menrating means you're not ovulating. Also has other implications though for things like bone health, right? because the ovary in addition to making eggs also makes estrogen and estrogen is super important for bone health. So yeah definitely if if you know one lesson for the listeners keep track of your we talked about semen analysis being kind of a marker of other health outcomes.

[02:27:59] Your periods are also a marker. Of course if you're on hormonal contraception you might not know what your natural cycle is doing. Um, but if your cycles are irregular or if you're not having them at all or if they're super painful or they're super heavy and sometimes you don't know what's super painful or super heavy because nobody talks about anything, you know, but thankfully this generation of young women is talking more and there's the internet, etc. But don't wait till you're ready to try to get pregnant to figure that out. You know, there may be something important you need to know way ahead of time. And we've already talked about obesity, but on the other side of that, is there a certain body fat level beneath which uh fertility is also impacted? Yeah, there's not like a cut off, but certainly being overweight or obese can impact fertility and being severely underweight. But for the underweight people, there's a similar mechanism. If you know, if your brain thinks there's just not enough, it's usually going to manifest through amenorhea. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So healthy weight, healthy diet, exercise, sleep, you know, sleep can also disrupted sleep could affect ovulation and fertility. Stress we mentioned all these things, all the things you mentioned in your book as well are all the same things that are important for fertility. Lastly, what do you what do you think is the most um promising area of research? And if we're sitting here in 10 years and we're talking about this and we're looking back at the last decade, uh what do you imagine you will be most excited about from an innovation perspective? Yeah, it's a very exciting field of medicine. There's always sort of innovations happening. I think let's see genetic testing will continue to evolve as we learn more about genetics.

[02:29:42] I think that'll play a bigger role. um automation in the lab. You know, a lot of the steps we talked about earlier are like literally embryologists sitting at the microscope doing these things, but now there's some companies developing these like lab on a chip concepts where like you put in the egg, put in the sperm, an embryo comes out. So micrfluidics or Yeah, micrfluidics. It the whole process being automated which

[02:30:10] I think is it's very interesting, right? And it could potentially improve access if you could put these labs. So do you see this as more of a cost reduction or more of a success improvement? Uh maybe both because you know reduce error potentially. Um usually the cost of things tends to go up before anytime anytime there's an innovation before it comes down. Maybe ultimately it'll come down but I I imagine costs will increase. Um so that's kind of an exciting area. in vitro maturation.

[02:30:43] That's where the eggs are like maturing in the petri dish instead of a in a woman's body. So potentially in the future, a woman wouldn't have to take all these injections and you just take the immature eggs, put them in the petri dish, and then give the petri dish the the medications, if you will. Um, that's in very sort of early stages, not quite as successful as conventional IVF yet.

[02:31:08] So, we're not quite there. I assume because it's difficult to harvest unmature follicles and even that maturation process, we haven't quite gotten it down like it happens in the body. Um, other things, a real gamecher would be something like in vitro gamtoenesis, which is making eggs and sperm potentially from skin cells. So even if you run out of eggs, if we could take like a skin biopsy and you know reprogram that cell to make an egg, then potentially you know any where are we in that? Very early. I think we'll see it eventually. It's been done in mice. Um so we're probably 10 to 20 years away.

[02:31:54] What's the what's the uh what's the obstacle? basically reprogramming skin cells. It just the whole process is very complicated um and and not easy. People are trying there a couple of companies trying is the challenge taking the skin cell back to a stem cell and then the stem cell into different and and which of those two steps do we think is harder skin cell back to stem cell or stem cell into egg?

[02:32:23] I think they're both hard. Um, I don't know. There's a couple different approaches including, you know, we work do research in this area as well where we're taking essentially the nucleus from a skin cell and putting it into a into another into an egg and just replacing genetic material. Yes, exactly. So, we don't have to reprogram the skin cell. We're just working on And is it easy to separate the chromosomes?

[02:32:48] No. Okay. I was going to say it's very complicated but um because I mean it's meiosis and but and it it's it's hard for it to happen efficiently and and equally etc. So we're working on it but we're you know probably 10 20 years away from but that would be an alternative way to get to that. Yeah. But then you need donor eggs so that has its own limitations because it's not like donor eggs are easy to come by either. Yeah, that's true.

[02:33:17] Although I guess what it does is it um it it helps the older woman who is able to make follicules but they're just annoyed. Exactly. A solution to that problem. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing we're working on is something called mitochondrial replacement therapy where uh basically similar concept you were taking like you have an older woman let's say she under goes IVF you have a donor that undergoes IVF but you take the nucleus out of the older egg and you put it in a younger egg. So essentially the cytoplasm is from the young egg including the mitochondria. So we think part of the aging is just like other aspects of aging, you know, acquired mutations in the mitochondria. So you have young cytoplasm, young mitochondria, maybe those eggs will do better or that nucleus will do better in that young egg. Um, unfortunately, we can't do that in the United States legally, but we're we're doing trials in other countries. This is kind of a remarkable field. Again, it's still amazing to me how well this works, right? Like if you think about it, this is and I don't mean this in a in a in a disparaging way at all. It's it's very brute force, right? It's very mechanical still. Um and yet we're, you know, as a field, not I think having an enormous impact that is is relatively recent, you know, when you when you sort of think about the time scale of this.

[02:34:48] Um, so it seems to me that early intervention is better. Yeah. Um, your point about women who have any sort of irregularity in their cycle, if they're in their teens or 20s, Yeah. if for no other reason beyond just the discomfort of it at the moment, getting this looked at now is a great way to get ahead of an infertility problem 10 years hence. For sure. Um, that to me is a very important takeaway that that I don't think is probably appreciated enough. And while I don't think we have a high listenership of 18-year-old girls, um, my guess is that message through parents who are listening might might make its way uh to potential future uh, patients that would that would would find up find themselves on your doorstep.

[02:35:37] Um, it's also comforting to hear just how high the probability of success is in the modern era today. Um, and it sounds to me like we're converging on quality, right? Whereas I would imagine this was this was a field that was a bit like the Wild West 20 years ago where you had a bunch of charlatans out there who were and maybe not charlatans is the wrong word, but just lowquality practitioners. And I'm guessing today with consolidation of groups, we're seeing less and less of that, more standardization. Yes, for sure. Um I'm still blown away at the concept of the embryologist and and what's required to to do that and how that we don't have a more formal training path given especially given that you said that we have a shortage of such people. That seems like an incredibly rewarding career uh for for somebody. So hopefully we can foster that. Um yeah. Well, anyway, Paula, this has been this has been great. I I feel between between this podcast and the podcast on male fertility, I have a much better sense of this uh of this and how to address it. Both very different problems, but but completely complimentary. For sure. Yeah.

[02:36:45] Appreciate your time and your expertise. Thanks for inviting me. It's been fun. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for having me. [Music]
