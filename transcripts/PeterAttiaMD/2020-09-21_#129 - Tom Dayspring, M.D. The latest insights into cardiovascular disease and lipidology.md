## Description

World-renowned lipidologist Tom Dayspring returns to give an update on the current thinking in lipidology as a follow-up to his 2018 five-part podcast series. In this episode, Tom discusses the growing consensus that atherogenic lipoproteins are essential drivers of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Tom further emphasizes apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). He provides insights into risk assessment, including which lab metrics to use, how to interpret them, and the appropriate therapeutic targets. Additionally, Tom discusses the most recent developments in lipid-lowering drug therapies—from the continued evolution of PCSK9 inhibitors, to the latest understanding of EPA and DHA, and the most recent addition of bempedoic acid to the list of  therapeutic agents.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with Dr. Tom Dayspring:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on updates in cardiovascular disease and lipidology since their last conversation two years ago. Key areas covered include:
- The growing recognition of atherogenic lipoproteins (particularly ApoB) as central to cardiovascular disease
- Updates on risk assessment methods
- New developments in lipid-lowering therapies
- The diminishing importance of HDL cholesterol as a metric

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- ApoB is now considered a more reliable metric than LDL-P for measuring atherogenic lipoproteins [15:30]
- 90-95% of ApoB particles are LDL particles due to their longer plasma residence time [22:45]
- HDL cholesterol is no longer considered a useful therapeutic target [45:20]
- Average HDL particle contains ~45 cholesterol molecules vs. 1500-2000 in LDL [48:15]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Get Lp(a) tested once in early adulthood [1:12:30]
- Focus on ApoB reduction rather than just LDL cholesterol [25:40]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
New Medications Discussed:
- Bempedoic acid (Nexletol) - new cholesterol synthesis inhibitor [1:35:20]
- EPA (4g/day) showing significant cardiovascular benefit [1:45:30]
- Fibrates still valuable for specific patient populations [1:55:15]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
Key Tests:
- ApoB as primary metric for atherogenic lipoproteins [20:15]
- Lp(a) testing recommended once in lifetime [1:12:30]
- VLDL cholesterol as proxy for remnant lipoproteins [1:28:45]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Lower is better when it comes to ApoB, and with current therapeutics, we can often attain physiologic concentrations under 50 mg/dL" [1:32:15]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What role will genetic testing play in future lipid management?
- How will new Lp(a)-lowering therapies impact treatment strategies?
- What is the full explanation for the failed EPA/DHA combination trial?

[00:00:01] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is dr tom day spring his name is probably familiar to some of you because back in october of 2018 we released a five part series with tom and that set of episodes despite being quite technical are some of the most popular episodes we've released especially amongst people who really like to get serious about their understanding of cardiovascular disease so we wanted to have tom back basically to pick it up where we left off and in this episode we try to focus on things that have changed in the last couple of years and that kind of loosely fell into three categories that we probe the first is digging really deeper into the recognition of the importance of atherogenic lipoproteins so kind of revisiting the idea of what apob is why it matters and both tom and i discuss a little bit about how our views have changed with respect to the use of apo b as a laboratory surrogate over ldlp and we get into all of the nuance around that with respect to vldls triglycerides lp little a etc we also get into why hdl cholesterol is a far less relevant metric at least why we believe that to be the case we then pivot a little bit and talk about risk assessment basically how do you understand these metrics how do you use these metrics this is a lot of the clinician type stuff here around apob and triglyceride rich lipoproteins we again revisit the idea of lp little a and then finally we bring it home with some discussion around therapies and in particular we talk about the continued evolution of the pcsk9s the evolving data around omega-3 fatty acids in particular some of the controversy between epa alone versus epa and dha and obviously we talk about the most recent addition to the lipid drug story which is a drug called benbendoic acid which has not been around very long and probably many people are not going to be familiar with that but tom does a great job explaining that tom's a diplomat of both the american board of internal medicine and the american board of clinical lipidology he practiced internal medicine in new jersey for 37 years the last 17 of which was devoted to consulting patients with lipid and cardiometabolic disorders between 2012 and 2019 he served as the chief scientific officer at two major cardiovascular biomarker laboratories since that time he has been working with us in our practice primarily on the research side of things but also as a consultant advising on most of our cardiovascular cases he's both a fellow of the american college of physicians and the national lipid association the nla and he's an associate editor at the journal of clinical lipidology he was also the recipient of the national lipid association 2011 president's service award he's authored and illustrated more manuscripts and book chapters related to lipids than i can count and so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with my mentor and friend tom dayspring [Music] hey tom thanks so much for uh for making time to sit down again and talk about lipids it's been almost two years since we sat down for what still remains the longest podcast i've ever done nearly eight hours which i believe was divided into a five part series that is still a very popular podcast series and don't take this the wrong way but i'm kind of surprised at the popularity of that episode given that i thought it was really geared only towards people that were really really die hard lipid fanatics but it's had uh broad enough appeal that i think we've agreed mutually that it makes sense to sit down again that was amazing first of all it's always great to sit down with you peter and chad about my little lipid world but yeah i'm shocked every time somebody tells me we've listened to the whole series and i've done it three times and i i just can't imagine that but i'm glad it came across pretty good you know one of the things i wanted to do today tom and i can promise you and all the listeners we are not going to do this for another eight hours today but what i want to do today is sort of i think kind of pick up the mantle from where we were a couple of years ago and talk about what's different since then i think the last two years has seen a number of things that are actually pretty exciting in the in the field of lipidology in the field of cardiovascular disease some of it's been at the really nuanced level scientifically others have been frankly at the broader level in terms of recognition of certain things that you know you've been talking about and many others people like alan snyderman have been talking about a lot of this stuff is very clinically relevant the way i pose this to you and i think this unless you're opposed to it the way i'd love to kind of go through this is maybe use our time today to talk about things that are different today than perhaps they were a few years ago and dive into those things in enough depth that everybody from the the lay person to the aficionado will have something to chew on yeah that's a perfect strategy for today now there's no doubt we'll reiterate some concepts that we went over in great depth back then but we won't have that opportunity today but and you know me peter i've always lived on the cutting edge of lipidology science leading the charge trying to understand new concepts that come down but one of the great satisfactions of my career is much of what i've promulgated for the longest time has come to fruition and and that's what's really happened in the last two years there are certainly some new concepts and some abandonment of some other issues but it's just the you know my whole mantra for a long time you know we've known each other a decade probably is that atherogenic lipoproteins are really the issue behind clinical atherosclerotic vascular disease and although many of us have known it for a while the data has just become so overwhelming that virtually all of the guidelines have signed on to that premise now that atherogenesis is certainly a sterol mediated disease but sterols are trafficked within april b containing lipoproteins which provides the vehicle that transports them into the artery wall where they can in some start a pathological process so it's the recognition of atherogenic lipoproteins that is now in the guidelines and you know anthrogenic lipoproteins are still diagnosed using various cholesterol metrics but there are things beyond ldl cholesterol matter in the guideline and even april b is certainly within every of the contemporary guidelines in the last two years and that's of course the allen snyderman thing that he's been harping about for a long long time so it's atherogenic lipoproteins within that category though the things that are also emerging is what contributes to the atherogenicity of an apob particle triglycerides has really taken center stage how they affect lipoprotein concentration and quality or functionality whatever adjective you want to ascribe to it's the loss of the ability of at least the hdl cholesterol metric to be terribly informative to us and it's the emerging significance for a lot of reasons of lipoprotein little a so those are the big areas where changes really become important and is really useful at the bedside of course pharmacology and intensity of pharmacology has also advanced and we'll touch a little bit on that today i'm sure to sort of summarize that we're going to talk about kind of double clicking on apo b slash ldl particle basically the atherogenic lipoproteins front and center in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease we're going to talk about the modification of our risk assessment and i like that you brought up hdl because i want to have a pretty interesting discussion about that and obviously we're going to talk about what's happened in therapies there have been actually quite a number of things including the continuation more data around ezetimibe and pcsk9 inhibitors much more data since we last spoke around omega-3 fatty acids i spoke with bill harris about that but i think we can go a little bit further and there are a couple of other therapies so let's start with maybe a little bit of a reminder for people as to what apo b is people like you and i sometimes use apo b and ldlp interchangeably as shorthand that's not entirely correct and when we last spoke we probably disproportionately spoke about the number of ldl particles and now we're going to focus on apob so do you mind explaining what the difference is both from a biology standpoint but also from a laboratory standpoint and those are critical points peter because it's one thing to talk about april b but almost what you're saying about it depends how did you analyze it what a laboratory metric do you order that you think is telling you something about april b whatever that encompasses so to make a story very simple and short you know lipids go nowhere in aqueous plasma because they're hydrophobic so for a lipid to be trafficked throughout plasma it has to attach to a protein now a few molecules of any lipid can attach to albumin but that's not the primary way lipids get anywhere serious collections of lipids hydrophobic substances attached to fairly significant proteins which solubilize them and these apo proteins as they're called proteins that wrap collections of lipids and stability to this macro molecule that we're going to call a lipoprotein so the main structural protein that enraps lipids in our body is april lipoprotein b it's a 500 kilodalton molecular weight protein so it's pretty big and it has a great ability to attract a lot of lipids to bind to it but once the lipids are bound to it this is a water-soluble lipid transportation vehicle there's basically one other class of lipoproteins and that is the hdl particles that you mentioned and they have no apob on them their structural protein is april lipoprotein a1 capital a dash either arabic or roman number one so right away we have a double classification of lipoproteins the apob containing they're often called beta lipoproteins or the al uh the apo a1 are called the alpha lipoproteins so now within that apob family it always gets a little more complex than lipid algae the two tissues in your body that can make apob are the liver hepatocytes and of course the small intestine which is absorbing a lot of lipids so it has to put them in something if those lipids are going to get into your plasma so the apob that's made in the liver is a big 500 kilodolton protein that i mentioned and it's called apo b100 now why do they add the hundred on it because the intestine also produces april b but it produces a truncated version that has 48 percent of the molecular weight of the hepatic produced april b so that's called apob-48 so if the liver makes an april b particle full of lipids it's got one molecule of apob 100 on it if the intestine makes a big lipoprotein and it does they're called chylomicrons that has one molecule in april b48 the intestine can put it in your lymphatics it enters the systemic circulation the liver just secretes it directly so those are the two types of able we're not going to talk a lot about cholera microns they're in most people without a pathological a genetic pathological issue it's not your color microns that are the major problem here they're a postprandial lipoprotein so the liver makes these apob 100 particles and they can go out the liver can secrete them but some of the particles that deliver secretes can be catabolized into smaller and smaller versions even though they're still apob proteins so if we're going to talk about the apo b100 family and i'm probably not going to use the term 100 anymore we're talking about very low density lipoproteins intermediate density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins and of course part of the ldl family is lipoprotein little a if you happen to produce that not everybody does to significant amounts the names of those particles as you know they were originally discovered via ultra centrifugation so the ones that floated on top of the tube with a very low density the ones that sank to the bottom where the high density and the in between were the idls and ldls now so the apob family is vldls plus idls plus ldls plus lp little a if you have it well that's true but here's the reality we have to look at plasma residence times how long do these things float around how long are they in your system because that's important because these are the particles that have the potential to crash your artery wall and traffic sterols and whatever else into the artery wall the calamaricons i mentioned are half-life is in minutes their plasma residence time a few hours the vldl particles their half-life is two to four to six hours depending how rapidly they're catabolized the ideal particles are a transient in between particle between a vldl and an ldl they're around for an hour or two they're not other than an unusual genetic condition a player in this apob game we're talking about and finally we have the ldl family now ldls have a plasma residence time of two to five days and there are other attributes to the ldl that determines is it gonna just hang around for two days or five days clearly the longer it hangs around you're going to have a lot more ldl particles than if you could rapidly clear them so when we talk about whatever apob metric you're doing technically you are measuring vldls they're remnants their smaller vldls idls plus ldls plus lp little a but because of the half-life 90 to 95 of your apob particles are ldl particles so that's why many people say hey april b is just another way of getting an ldo particle count and that's true even in people who might have a lot of remnants the remnant particle number is quite small it is still way more ldl particles floating around in these people who might have these remnant vldls that cause issue not to say a vldl remnant might not be a very injurious apob containing particle it certainly is in some people but if we're looking at the number which is the primary driving force as to how an apob particle enters the artery wall ldl is king and that's why our metrics of april b or ldl particle count are what are at the top of all the guidelines and of course the metric most people use are ldl cholesterol and non-hdl cholesterol i mean tom on a personal level the reason i have switched to apob in our practice which is obviously heavily influenced by the work that you've discussed the work that people like alan snyderman have been doing for many years frankly comes down to a consistency factor so we had historically relied on ldl p ldl particle number as a concentration count but frankly in the span of eight years went through three technologies to do that right two generations of nmr coupled with electrophoresis and while in the end we felt the electrophoresis provided the most accurate measurement you always have a problem when you don't know what you're comparing it to so if we have gen 1 nmr which is probably still being used by lab core and quest today that is probably quite inaccurate compared to gen 2 nmr but the percentiles meaning the populations of people that were measured are still what we use to understand where someone lies it puts you in a bit of a dilemma as a clinician or as a patient you want to continually upgrade your technology in other words if you're talking about getting a new iphone you don't really care that your phone is so much better than two generations ago's phone because all your metrics are better and there's nothing to be gained by comparing yourself to how much better you are but when you're talking about diagnostics it does matter where your reference range is and if you're moving it so do you agree with my logic for switching to apob a year ago as now being a much more homogeneous way to assess patients even across labs so especially now in light of covid we can't always use the same lab to measure apob so you know i might be sending a patient to one lab versus another lab and i just feel like we're getting better results this way does that jive with you no that makes total sense and a real important take-home point for listeners is pick your favorite metric peter's right now is april b mine right now is april b and stick with it don't do apo b this time in an ldo particle count via nmr peter didn't even mention quest has a particle number technique called ion mobility transfer that people are they're not comparable all biomarkers you should consistently try and use of course the same lab not always possible but the same assay and the apob assay is pretty standard throughout the industry it's not like everybody's got their own apo b essay diana mark can vary widely the other big reason to do that consistency of results over time or later yourself you're going to read the guideline or maybe your patients are going to go all the guidelines talk about apo b there is no guideline telling you to do a nmr ldlp or an immobility ldlp so it's another reason to just stick with the april b and i think there are less false positives with the apo b it's just been my personal experience i've been an nmr guy all my life and as we got better and better we just so often saw totally unexplainable discordance between ldlp and april b the data is overwhelming for apob so i think that's where you should be in today's world as your marker of atherogenic lipoproteins yeah i think we saw that especially with the second generation nmr it was almost like it had become too sensitive we were seeing discordance that far exceeded what the framingham or mesa data predicted the discordance should have been and that's really actually what took us to the ion mobility assay but again i'm actually very from a diagnostic and management standpoint i'm actually quite comfortable with where we are i think the final point i'd add to that tom is just the economic one you know frankly i think the cost of an apob is you know at least in canada and the only reason i know that is because alan schneiderman is at mcgill and you know he's been pounding this for a while i mean we're talking about a three or four dollar test so there is no excuse for any physician to say we're not going to order your fancy apo b because it costs too much i'm going to order the ldl cholesterol i think that excuse has lost all of its water it's so true and alan just published a beautiful paper where he's researched the course of apob assays because you know even some of the people in the guidelines always oh we can't say april b it's so expensive that's an old excuse that is no longer applicable to 2020. so of all the technologies to quantitate atherogenic lipoproteins apob is the most affordable and even you know look labs sometimes change crazy but if you tell a lab you want to pay a cash price it's really pretty cheap yeah let's go back to kind of the macro point here around apob which is a greater coalescing around the idea that that apo b concentration matters so i think it's very well understood that two of the biggest risk factors for cardiovascular disease are smoking and hypertension i don't think there is any ambiguity that cigarette smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and they both appear to do so through a mechanism that weakens the endothelium or creates an injury to the endothelium the question now becomes as you put it tom how iron-clad is the story that it's the apo b-bearing particle in the presence of injured endothelium that is the trojan horse that begins this destructive trajectory of taking that cholesterol into the sub-endothelial space becoming retained undergoing this chemical oxidation process which then kicks off an inflammatory response that paradoxically as an attempt to repair the damage results in what can be a fatal injury there are other hypotheses for example there are people who note and we have i mean look i have a patient in our practice tom you've weighed in on her case walks around with a total cholesterol of 300 and something an ldl cholesterol of 220 milligrams per deciliter an apob of 170 milligrams per deciliter she's in her late 60s and her coronary artery calcium score is zero we have elected to not treat her with any lipid lowering therapy in other words there are exceptions to this how do we reconcile that well it's the human body in medicine as you know not all smokers are going to come down with lung cancer or chronic obstructive lung disease why not if that's such a horrible risk factor i try to explain this a co and i've certainly seen cases like you say where oh my god if i was just going to say give me your april b or whatever cholesterol metric you're going on three drugs right now you've got no choice and maybe the old days we approach people that way but no more i think you have to individualize your whatever risk factors you discover that might wind up causing atherogenesis and then figure it out so particle number is certainly a major factor that might force it in but not always endothelial function although you can certainly if you review the history of this and how do you really determine endothelial function not everybody has serious endothelial dysfunction who winds up with atherosclerosis so particle number itself and some people can just make the particles go in i think if we take most adults who's not going to have a little bit of endothelial dysfunction so i agree with you it's a combination of something about atherogenic particles be it their number endothelial dysfunction but i'm talking more and more now when i discuss any type of lipoprotein i don't care which subgroup you want to talk about i think we certainly have to know its particle concentration but i like to talk about particle quality so what are the other attributes of any lipoprotein that might contribute to its atherogenicity or in some perhaps not understood make it relatively it's not going to generate atherosclerosis and there certainly have to be things like that going on so as we're getting smarter we're looking at other components of the lipoproteins that could be other proteins that are on them that could be their complex lipidome and trying to see aha can that help us discern whether in you a given particle concentration is more worrisome than it is in the next in the next person so there's a lot going on and also from the gist of this conversation listeners will know atherosclerosis atherogenesis is a multi-complex multifactorial disease and that's why even when peter and i if we consult on a case and we realize in this person we have to beat up apo b and get their particle numbers to a more physiologic range we don't stop once we do that we examine in great detail for other things that might be injuring the endothelium or the arterial wall and see are any of those treatable or so so we're getting a little bit smarter on lipoproteins but there certainly is more to it than just particle number do we think that there's a limit to where the benefit of reduction becomes diminishing or even j curves in the other direction so we discussed it in the first episode significantly we did so again with ron krauss it wouldn't be you know the worst idea in the world a couple of years from now to sit down and do it again and re-examine the data but but again i think the causal relationship between apob and atherosclerosis is as strong as virtually anything we see in medicine for which you can't do the perfect experiment where you have to rely on natural experiments nevertheless maybe it's not entirely clear what the dose response looks like so if you have somebody whose apo b is 160 milligrams per deciliter there's a risk reduction that comes to lowering it from 160 to 100 and lowering it from 100 to 80 and lowering it from 80 to 60. what do we know about the risk reduction in lowering it say from 60 to 40 to 20 and i ask both what we could infer pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically in other words from the mendelian randomization versus the pharmacologic well even using pharmacologic trials and mendelian randomization you're going the concept you're going to come across with is lower is better and with the pharmacologic thing we're modulating things that either have clinical trial proof that if you lower them it's good or the mendelian randomization looking at genes where that drug might be doing something it works now you do need a few apo b containing lipoproteins they do traffic other lipids they traffic fat soluble lipoproteins but we must never confuse a beta lipoproteinemia where nobody or that person can't make them or hypobatic lipoprotein where they make a few enough to traffic those other things that a lipoprotein might have to traffic but even the guidelines where they examine people base looking at their baseline april b or ldl cholesterol the first thing they suggest at least in the higher risk people is try and get a 50 reduction and that's where most of the bang for the buck is going to be now if you still have options that you can lower it further yeah the trials show yeah there is incremental reduction events but it's a much smaller absolute risk reduction and dropping at the 50 percent or so so i don't know if that answers your question so most people don't have the type of levels where with modern therapeutics with modern lifestyle we can more often than not attain physiologic concentrations and if i want to talk about april b that's probably under 50 milligrams per deciliter if we can get there that's what the newborns have that's when you go in clinical trials if you take it down that low you see your most risk reduction and so far at least with pharmacologic lowering of apob with the currently fda approved drugs there is no signal of harm yeah again it's funny because i was just about to say with the current crop of drugs specifically the pcsk9 inhibitors we are routinely seeing patients who easily can get an apob into the 20 to 40 milligram per deciliter range you and i actually sat down a couple of months ago and did a calculation to estimate how much cholesterol is actually contained in the circulating lipoproteins versus that which is in cell membranes do you remember doing this with me not per se but uh and where we're developing equations you're the master of that well it was one of these things right it was it was sort of like look you know when you look at a person's plasma glucose level you realize pretty quickly it represents a tiny fraction of total body glucose and similarly there's such a concern about plasma cholesterol level but you know given how essential cholesterol is it's understandable why people would be concerned that low cholesterol could be problematic but once you do the calculation and realize virtually all of the cholesterol in the body is contained within the cell membrane or within the steroidal producing tissue the circulating amount is a very narrow window into the total amount of cholesterol and therefore a reduction of say 60 milligrams per deciliter to 50 milligrams per deciliter of apob or even something more extreme like a full 50 reduction of total cholesterol 200 milligrams per deciliter to 100 milligrams per deciliter does not represent a significant reduction in total body cholesterol that's a very important point all right let me repeat it you have a total body cholesterol that you measure in the plasma that says oh it's 200 milligrams per deciliter that goes down to 100 milligrams per deciliter let's say the ldl fraction reduced from you know 150 to 75 or something someone might say god you just cut cholesterol in half that can't be good for you given the importance of cholesterol but my point is no you simply cut the amount of cholesterol being carried by the lipoproteins in the plasma in half that doesn't capture the majority of the cholesterol yes thanks for refreshing my memory what you're talking about now it's really pools of cholesterol throughout the body and i think i'm so glad you brought this up because this is just not even understood even in the lipidology community we have a total body cholesterol there are basically three pools there's your brain and nothing we're talking about today has anything to do with brain cholesterol it's a separate system it doesn't interact with the other cells in your body or certainly with the cholesterol in your plasma so if it's not in your brain where is cholesterol in your body well it's either in all your peripheral cells perhaps some more than others or it's circulating in your plasma and if it's in the plasma where is it there's a itsy weensy amount bound to albumin there's more bound within all of the lipoproteins that are trafficking in your body meaning your apob and your apo a1 particles but believe it or not if i wanted to search down blood cholesterol for you i would suck out your red blood cells and extract cholesterol from them red blood cells carry far far more cholesterol than do all of your lipoproteins put together and the other crucial point you made subtly and i hope everybody understood you the amount of cholesterol within your lipoproteins has no correlation with your cellular cholesterol or even your red blood cell cholesterol so whatever however you're modulating some ldl total cholesterol hdl cholesterol metric that tells you nothing about what might you be doing to the cholesterol content of your cells so don't have a panic attack if you're making ldl cholesterol 30 because i can assure you virtually every cell in your body even if that's your plasma ldl cholesterol has more than enough cholesterol because it can denovo synthesize it it can put it in its cell membranes or other organelles that require cholesterol if it's a sterogenic steroidogenic tissue can produce a little more or perhaps deliberate someone so there's no cell that's being deprived of cholesterol in the periphery when you're modulating lipids through lifestyle or drugs tom what's the best explanation for why it's not the red blood cell that is the primary driver of atherosclerosis given the fact you just stated which is red blood cells contain within them a lot of cholesterol within their membranes and red blood cells clearly traffic to and from past the endothelium i certainly have my own answer for this question i think the histology makes it abundantly clear but is there any thought you would add to that no i think histologically we know it's foam cells and where do foam cells get their sterol content from ingesting oxidized lipoproteins carrying cholesterol is the vase of a sorum which supplies the arterial intimate with blood cells dumping red blood cells in there that are contributing cholesterol maybe a few molecules but i don't think we have any evidence that's the driver of cholesterol that's resulting in arterial wall pathology yeah this is one of those moments where sometimes a picture just serves a thousand words and maybe this will be one of the best i mean we're going to obviously accompany this podcast with a a lot of figures and diagrams of yours but what we're basically talking about is you have to differentiate from the vasovasorum side which is the non-luminal side of the vessel where of course you have to have blood vessels to keep the artery itself alive versus the luminal side where the endothelial lining is damaged by everything including just daily life but certainly high blood pressure smoking uric acid high glucose high insulin shear forces you name it and that's what's allowing these labor proteins in but you're right it's really this histologic examination that makes a very clear unmistakable case that it's not the cholesterol in the membrane that's doing this it's this trafficked cholesterol that ultimately becomes a foam cell through the macrophages ingestion of the lipoprotein that is the insult that's a pretty good tour de force on this topic one more little caveat peter with that vasovosaurum as you know as you have an evolving plaque it gets bigger and bigger and it becomes prone to erosion or rupture and the coagulation system so there's nothing to say that even in a minuscule histologic rupture of a plaque that the vase of storm can't be contributing some clotting factors or something else to that pathological process it almost assuredly does at some point once you have damage i would fully expect coagulation factors to be coming from both sides the luminal side and the vasovasarum side it's an all hands on deck war and the uric acid too probably you know which can crystallize just like cholesterol you touched on it in the outset which is what have the guidelines stated with respect to other lipoproteins so if we take a step back and we went back to the early 1980s right in the early 1980s when we were just beginning to talk about the sub-fractionation of cholesterol so a little history lesson for people it's 1959 ish early 1960s ansel keyes is clearly on to something and he is identifying a relationship between serum cholesterol and coronary artery disease he's correctly identifying a relationship and at the time they're doing very rudimentary assessments saying hey if you take the people who are in the top 10 of serum cholesterol and you compare them to the people in the bottom 10 of serum total cholesterol there's a profound difference in atherosclerosis most people are unfamiliar with how that history went and then you know where it got taken off the rails a little bit by what might be the root cause of those things but nevertheless it was pretty clear into the 1960s and 70s that something about serum cholesterol mattered eventually people began to as you pointed out tom begin to fractionate those things so it wasn't just about total cholesterol it became about different densities of those cholesterols and these lipoproteins some of them were lighter some of them were heavier and really light and heavier the wrong words they had different densities but one that emerged pretty quickly as a contrast to the low density lipoprotein was the high density lipoprotein and through all of the epidemiologic work that emerged in the late 70s and into the early 80s and that also by the way continued into the 90s through the work of jerry rieven as he was in the early stages of identifying what would be called metabolic syndrome at the time called cinder max it became clear that higher levels of cholesterol in the hdl particle which unfortunately is erroneously often referred to as high good cholesterol had a positive association the opposite of what we have just been describing which is high levels of cholesterol in the ldl particle there's a lot less talk of that today at least amongst the people who know what they're talking about unfortunately there's still a lot of people who talk about that on social media but why is it that we aren't sitting here in the guidelines talking about hdl cholesterol the so-called quote unquote i hate to use this word good cholesterol and you know i'm in your corner on that one folks there's one cholesterol molecule i don't care whether it's in your cell whether it's in any lipoprotein in your brain if i drew you the structure of cholesterol it's identical so how dare we put an adjective on it like that's good and that's bad how do you know so you don't so they're silly terms but they they sort of evolve for a good reason and this is a wonderful historical journey that you really have to do to figure out why did hdl have like such importance and now it's an afterthought although it's an afterthought i must say virtually all of the current risk algorithms that are used to classify you as are you at high very high moderate or low risk still use the metric hdl cholesterol to determine that because the data is just 40 50 years old the problem with hdl cholesterol as a metric is all those studies that seems to suggest say higher is better or lower is worse we're never adjusted for anything else so you know observational type data aha i found the answer here it is you got blue eyes and everybody with blue eyes gets this that or whatever and of course you never adjusted for oh wait a minute everybody with the blue eyes has this lethal thing going on also so in retrospect it turns out that the overwhelming majority of people who might have low hdl cholesterol have a high april b level and that's what drives their atherosclerosis so all guidelines even though they might do your baseline risk using an april b metric like total or ldl cholesterol they'll use hdl cholesterol as trying to figure out the lipid component to your wrist they use smoking and blood pressure and other things peter talked about also when they get to goals of therapy though only because we have multiple trials now where for decades people have been trying this that and everything to raise hdl cholesterol because if high is better than low raising it has to be fantastic and not a single trial has ever panned out that what you do to hdl cholesterol results in cardiovascular benefit let's pause there for one sec tom and just make sure people understand that there have been multiple trials using at least two maybe more technical approaches to raise that number that is unambiguously associated with better outcomes is that correct no there are no clinical trials that would support raising no no no i'm sorry there have been multiple clinical trials that have attempted to raise hdl cholesterol that's true yes and it's more than two drugs there are other drugs that yeah there's more than two mechanisms of action correct at least two that i can think of there might be there's probably three mechanisms of action that have been that would all raise hdl cholesterol but the point that you made that is should not be lost on anyone is at best those trials have been neutral as have the mendelian randomization trials looking at genetic surrogates of hdl and cardiovascular outcomes yes and at worst those trials have been harmful yeah there are plenty of people and you know and you've seen them in your practice certainly i have when i was practicing with high heel cholesterol who are full of plaque and we do see people with low hdl cholesterol who just like you said you see some people with high ldl or total cholesterol don't have plaque there are plenty of people with low hgl cholesterol who my god you don't seem to have much cardiovascular risk so there has to be if hdls are important to the cardiovascular system and i maintain they are the metric hdl cholesterol is useless yeah and this is really where i think i want to go with this and just i mean there's so much we could say on this but i i think it's worth maybe even just explaining this very important point right which is hdl cholesterol the number that everybody sees when they look at their lipid panel that if it's below 40 milligrams per deciliter is probably flagged as being too low if it's above 70 your doctor gives you a high five that is measuring the concentration of cholesterol within an hdl particle now it doesn't tell you anything about the functionality of that particle and this is where i think i don't remember if it was ron krauss that said this but someone said this to me and i've never forgotten it it might have been alan actually they said this ldl biology stuff is trivial all you got to do is lower it it's the hdl biology that is really complicated that's what the 21st century is going to be about we don't have a clue what we're talking about with hdl we've been using this idiotic crude metric of how much cholesterol it contains it is now completely clear that that was the wrong metric then any attempts to increase it were futile we've count the number of particles we can even measure the size of them that also appears to be almost as crude as what the cholesterol concentration is but to come up with an assay that truly measures functionality may be beyond the scope of laboratories whereas with the apobldl side of the equation it really appears to be a stochastic problem the more of these things you have to the first order the more problems you have you've already alluded to other attachments to them that can add second and third order terms but i mean do you agree with my assessment tom that this hdl problem is way harder and we don't have a clue what we're talking about oh it's just so perfect what you've just said in the last few minutes it's you know we all use laboratory metrics to try and figure out what a given biomarker tells us and what we can do about it and the only metric that's really available to the world world now is hdl cholesterol which peter says that's the collective cholesterol mass within all the hdls that exists in a deciliter of your plasma if you are doing ion mobility or nmrs you can get an hdl particle count but that although it might be a tad better than hdl cholesterol telling you something there's so many exceptions to that rule that it's not a useful bedside metric either but presuming again hdls must perform some function in the human body and part of that function might be either preventing or putting out arterial wall plaque fires that have many uh ideologies how can we measure what peter referred to as the functionality of the hdl particle you know being a fireman's son if you listen to that last podcast i look at hdls as fire engines but i know any fire department has about 10 different types of different fire trucks and they all supply something different that firefighters can use to extinguish a fire some might carry chemicals some might carry ladders axes water some carry more firemen than others so what type of fire truck do you need at a given scene well it depends what the heck the scene is all about so what do hdl's do they certainly traffic some degree of cholesterol which it turns out is probably just there for stoichiometric reasons make it a spherical particle to which other things can attach the other things that are in that hdl remember hcls are tiny so they don't carry a lot of cholesterol here's a stat that will astound a lot of people if i took the average hdl particle the average size hdl particle out of your plasma how many molecules of cholesterol would be inside of it about 45 how many molecules are in the average size ldl particle about fifteen hundred two thousand so the volume of a sphere is a third power of the radius what might influence even the cholesterol content of 45 cholesterol molecules within an hdl well it's a sphere there's only so much can go in there what if that hdl was carrying extra triglycerides for whatever reason well it couldn't carry very many cholesterol molecules so that would be a cholesterol depleted hdl what if that hdl if i had five groups of hdl particles same size same cholesterol content but they all had different phospholipids on their surface lipidome or they all were trafficking different proteins they all have apoa1 but what else are they carrying and those proteins have a multitude of functions dan rader years ago always tell me tom hdls are part of the innate immune system they're little fire engines they're carrying god knows what that could go into wherever there's inflammation in your body a swollen knee any in-tissue injury or your arterial wall and they could maybe help what's going on there because they're trafficking immunomodulatory functionality molecules or they could go in because oh my god these are corrupt hdls they're carrying bad junk which is further inflaming it we have no way of measuring those now i mean researchers can do lipodome analysis of the phospholipids the sphingolipids the ceramides that are in hdls we can you know they've identified over 150 different proteins that might be on an hdl now they're not all on one given hdl but some hdls may have two of this protein none of that and you have different groups of hdls in my analysis they're different types of fire engines carrying different things peter in our lifetime there will never be an affordable reproducible uh high throughput way of evaluating any people are hanging their hats now on the ability of hdl's to efflux cholesterol from a cell and hey if an hdl can suck some sterols out of your foam cells yeah i'm kind of thinking that's pretty good but it's probably a minuscule function of the hundred other functions that hdls can do so what if the hdl is pulling out some cholesterol but it's dumping other crap in the process so if we ever had an hdl function panel it's going to be a dozen or more type tests which we're not going to see because of nobody's going to pay for them the research to be done to prove that these have relevance in a large clinical trial is just not going to be done so that's the dilemma there are such panels right i mean i think i feel like i've seen a couple of commercial panels that attempt to subdivide the hdl particles even further i've never personally been able to know what to do with such panels and and i you know these days i don't even look at apo a1 anymore i'm really focusing most of my efforts on vldl cholesterol as a poor man's proxy for remnant basically as a strategy for how to lower apob apob lp little a and then focusing just frankly much more on the metabolic stuff that we've talked about the obviously glucose insulin homocysteine uric acid much more aggressive stance on blood pressure but in some ways my my lipid world has become a little bit easier in light of this discussion we're having it is because you've got the ability based on analysis and understanding of things to not order these silly hocus pocus hdl panels that are being offered by people as a way to generate revenue now look i've been associated with labs all my life i'm not at the present time i don't work for any lab that does or doesn't do any of these tests you're talking about but mostly those panels that you look at they're looking they're reporting hdl size they're reporting apoa1 peter knows there can be from one to five molecules on april a1 on your various hdl species so you have just a few hdls carrying a lot of apoa1 or do you have a ton of hdls that carrying little april a1 and that could be a misleading metric people are looking at some of these phospholipids now some labs are offering ceramide levels or sphingosine levels but again the tr you can find something that might support that but then you have to weigh it against the apob and the things that are almost beyond discussion and you would realize this is contributing nothing to me why am i even ordering this am i trying to impress some patient that i can use big words and this means anything so they're silly i'm in all for doing research on hdl functionality and looking into it so we all get a better comprehension of it i'd love to have a test that tells us what i talk about the flux of hdl particles how do little incy wincy hdl's mature fill up then what do they do with that cholesterol and are they catabolized are they not catabolized are your hdls pulling cholesterol out of an artery wall and then sharing it with an ldl that might take it right back into the artery wall so there's just so many phenomenal issues to get into with hdl but right now don't waste your money you're going to get an hdl cholesterol everybody's going to be doing a lipid panel do not waste your money time or your brain energy on trying to figure out these hdl metrics so let's at that junction pivot now to more of the risk assessment stuff we have talked probably on at least two podcasts about lp little a you and i spoke about it during our marathon podcast i think we had an ama segment where bob kaplan asked me a lot of questions about lp little a it's still on my list of things to do i'd love to have sam tamikus on the podcast for people who don't know sam is certainly among close to the world's experts on lp little a and i think frankly a dedicated podcast on this topic is warranted given that directionally one in ten people listening to this podcast has an elevated lp little a and it represents unless you correct me tom i believe it would represent the single greatest genetic driver of atherosclerosis so here we have this thing called lp little a that tragically most people don't know they have you know i'll tell you a funny story have you ever heard of this reality tv show called alone no i don't think i've watched tv in 12 years but it now shows up on netflix and i do watch netflix from time to time so a friend of mine mentioned to me the other day he goes you got to check out this this show called alone it's right up your alley people they take these people who have remarkable survival skills and they throw them out in the world's worst environment 10 of them separately of course and basically the person who last calls uncle wins half a million bucks so i'm into season six right now which is it's the first one i've watched but it's it's clearly into a really nasty part of the arctic so i'm watching this and i'm just humbled by the fact that these people can survive any length of time anyway one of the guys in the show you know you learn their backstory and he's this guy looks as impressive as anybody i've ever seen but somehow it comes up that part of his motivation for doing this is he had a heart attack like the year before and i think he's 39 on the show implying that he had his heart attack at the age of 38 or thereabouts now if you looked at this guy tom you wouldn't think this is the kind of guy that could have a heart attack i mean he looks he is a specimen and of course what's the first thing that comes to my mind well i've seen this story play out 50 000 times right i mean i my my wife's grandfather died at 40. he was a firefighter fit as a fiddle dropped dead of a heart attack at 47 in my mom's dad's arms when he was 16. so i know the story very well and it's to me it's lp little a until proven otherwise anahat o'connor wrote a great story about this in the new york times several years ago disclosing that he himself found he's a carrier of lp little a so always want to make sure everybody stops reevaluates makes sure that they aren't a high lp little a carrier what else is on our list of real risk assessment here and and by the way feel free to just pile on to more lp little a stuff because this to me is i mean this this is interesting stuff and i do think unlike my pessimism around hdl where i don't think we're going to learn a whole heck of a lot about it i think we're just scratching the surface of differentiating between really aggressive lp little a's versus not as aggressive lp little a's and i'm optimistic there well you're right and of course on the favor of lp little a being dangerous is the a bunch of mendelian randomization trials which don't exist for any hdl metric or so so right away it's a a marker that requires more serious evaluation or so you want to remind people again what it is i guess i glossed over that you know sure for those new to this a low density lipoprotein is a collection of cholesterol triglycerides phospholipids wrapped by a single molecule of vapor lipoprotein b because of the size and density it falls within a certain fraction of their centrifuge tube and it's called low density but all lipoprotein subclasses are heterogeneous they consist of big particles small particles or maybe a particle carrying something else that doesn't really change its density that much so it separates with the ldls and lp little a is basically you have your ldl part of this macromolecule but co-attached to the apob structural protein is another protein that shouldn't be there and it's called apoprotein little a and by little a we mean small case not a capital a and that molecule that attaches apoa you know can vary in molecular weight size length etc but that's beyond this discussion so it's an ldl that's carrying an extraneous passenger and here's the problem we know people with high lp little a that god they don't seem to be bothered they're not coming down there's no premature family history in them and other people's the example peter just gave my god there are atherosclerotic wrecks at young ages so i also just as i've sort of iterated about other lipoproteins i think when we're talking about lp little a in the year 2020 we are talking about all right let's what's its mass what's its lp little a particle number but i also think we have to be smarter on understanding the quality or other attributes of this lp little a particle what makes this apollo a attachment may be terrible for that guy who had his heart attack at age 38 but here are other people who they're coming in at age 80 and they got high yelpy little a and they're not full of plaque or so and one of the things we're beginning to understand is look apoa has potentially some thrombogenic properties which perhaps get expressed in some people more than others but more and more one of the functions perhaps even of apoa why it even evolved is a little scavenger protein that attaches to oxidized lipid moieties specifically oxidized phospholipids oxidized sterols they bind to it with great affinity and maybe that little garbage truck full of oxidized particles if it could bring it back to the liver or some other tissue that could catabolize it those oxidized lipid moieties which tend to be destructive to cells are not getting to cells so we are beginning to have metrics that are starting to appear and available in the real world that we can measure the oxidation the oxidized lipid moieties that are on april little a they're actually it's called oxidized pl fossil lipids on april b and if you say well these oxidized phospholipids are on all the apob particles to a minuscule degree for because of the affinity of oxidized lipid mortise to apoa the overwhelm if you have a positive oxidized phospholipid april b the overwhelming majority of apob particles trafficking those oxidized lipids are lp little a particles so if two people came to consult me tomorrow they both have an elevated lp little a metric one has a normal oxidized phospholipids on april b but the other one is elevated based on samsumicus and others worse work i'm going to be a little more worried about that person who's my god not only do they have this undesirable particle but this particle is loaded down with injurious other lipids that are potentially very harmful so that's one aspect of it we're nowhere near being able to test for the thrombogenicity if that's a big factor of april little a and everything so there are other ways of doing this i mean i all the time when i get my weekly email from peter thia here's the podcast this week i'm waiting for sam samika sue but for those of you still waiting for peter to nab him he's pretty active on twitter and he he really tweets a lot of good information on the cutting edge of what's coming down with lp i think it's lp little a dash underscore doc something like but but go on twitter and sam samikas t-s-i-m-i-k-s and you'll be happy you followed them so there's just a lot to understand peter so it's who has it and by the way the new guidelines are the european guidelines suggest that everybody ought to have it once in their life as they approach adulthood and you never need repeat it unless somehow you're trying to modulate it or maybe you go through menopause where it can go up a little bit but it's a genetically determined marker you have it or you don't have it if you don't have it at age 18 you're not going to have it at age 68. so it's a one-time test and it helps us before we talk let's do thorough cardiovascular risk assessments no matter what your apob is and this would be one of the tests that at least the europeans have signed on to now the national lipid association other people have issued guidelines to it and they're still telling you well do it for unexplained heart attacks or strong family history of heart disease to me it's again it's not a very expensive test get it once and for all but there's so much to talk about this uh peter and in the future i mean there are ways what would you do for somebody with high lp little a we have strategies which is mostly attacking april b right now and any other cardiovascular risk factor but there are drugs in the pipeline that may give us better alternatives to perhaps stop your liver from making april little a let's talk about that a little bit so up until i would say a few years ago the only strategy for patients let's assume that we've confirmed that a patient's lp little a is elevated and furthermore let's confirm that we have reason to believe that in that patient the lp little a is also problematic and again this usually shows up in family history it's not a subtle thing a lot of times i'm taking the family history from a patient before i've got the blood test that'll be there those could be offset by weeks and it's because we give our patients the template to work on this they come in with a very thorough family history they really know what happened to you know the mother's older sister and the grandfather and all of these other things and you know you usually just see this history of heart lots of heart attacks before the age of 60. obviously it can be confounded by people who are heavy smokers and things like that but yeah let me just interrupt you for one second it'll be a minute because published yesterday in the journal of the american college of cardiology is a study and a fantastic editorial and they looked at people with terrible family histories of heart disease and people who had lp little a issues or they didn't and the conclusion was simple don't have high lp little a if somehow you can avoid that which you can't don't have a terrible family history of coronary artery disease and i don't know how you avoid that but if you want the worst scenario don't have both lp little and so peter what peter is just saying is now backed up by a nice study yeah i love the uh best advice is choose healthier parents so let's assume we're in that situation which is we have high lp little a and we have the the family history that is not favorable or something else that's even more germane to the patient which is a positive calcium score something to that effect well again historically our best bet would be remove all other risk to the extent that it is possible so we lower all other apob maximally pharmacologically we optimize completely all of the metabolic parameters that we've discussed briefly here but touched on in greater detail elsewhere and that includes everything from modulating blood pressure as aggressively as it needs to be to controlling all of these other factors that don't get enough attention in my book the uric acids the homocysteine things like that but then as you pointed out there's a strategy now that says wait a minute what if we knock out the liver's ability to make apo little a and all of a sudden you wouldn't have an lp little a so what does that strategy look like and and where is that strategy in the pharmacologic pipeline in pretty early trials and of course any cell we're talking about the liver here if the liver is the primary site of production of apo little a and it is if we could mess with the genes through aso therapy we could probably stop a cell from making a given protein if we can stop the liver from making april protein little a if you don't have that you certainly the liver can't secrete it so it can attach to ldl particles transforming them into lp little a particles so that's almost like a no-brainer the mendelian randomization trial says don't have high apoa or lp little a so let's just inhibit its synthesis as we've done with other things that contribute to coronary artery disease and that has to work yes provided that protein doesn't screw or that aso treatment doesn't screw up something else or cause a downside to it and that's why you ultimately have to do large clinical trials looking at not only event reduction but safety but those drugs are in early you know like anything else the first generation of those antisense oligosaccharide drugs that came around they've perfected them so there's a second generation of them now that they've made even more hepatoselective so they can dose less of it and it goes right into the liver but they're phase one phase 1-2 trials and novartis i believe has now acquired the product that they're going to put it in a major which has just started enrollment of phase 3 trial on let's not but here's the problem peter knows the billions that probably have to be invested when you're developing a drug of that type of magnitude to reduce something you're not going to do it on every tom dick and harry who has a trivial lp little a you want that first trial to work because if it doesn't that's it detroit the drug is dead it'll never be tested in lesser risk people so the only way you can get into this current apo little a synthesis modulator drug is you have to have had an atherosclerotic clinical event a myocardial infarction stroke blah blah blah stents and you have to have an astronomical like upper quintile concentration of lp little a because mendelian trials suggests if you're going to get benefit by lowering april little a or lp little a it has to be a pretty significant drop in it so you're not going to take somebody with a trivial lp little a elevation and you know if you tested 50 000 maybe it would work but so if they go through this first trial and it'll probably take three four five years to show efficacy and safety then they're going to have to maybe do some sub uh trial analysis and then is anybody even going to fund the primary prevention trial with this drug with the course that that takes i don't know so even if you're somebody who's had a heart attack because of lp little and you're waiting for this drug you've got five ten years to wait and for primary prevention go on to other ways that clinicians are attacking this problem right now because you're not gonna have anything why is it that statins which are probably the most potent drug until five years ago to lower ldl and by definition then lower apob concentration have virtually no effect on lp little a but this new class of drug that's been around for five years called pcsk9 inhibitors well even more potent in lowering ldl seem to also be able to lower lp little a i think there's two reasons there and one we've gotten enough trials now that seem to show depending on your apoa makeup do you produce the large high molecular weight apoa or the smaller low molecular weight apoa which in epidemiologic trials seems to be way more associated with atherosclerosis that if you're one who does produce the low molecular weight short apoa which means because it's such a small protein to make the liver can make a ton of it secrete it so they actually even though their molecular weight of april little a is lower they have much higher lp little a particle counts if you have that isoformity lp little a statins can induce the synthesis of that statins do not affect the synthesis of the larger apoa moiety so in some people peter says statins do not much to lp little a concentrations but there is a small component where statins will actually raise it a little bit and people get scared they go well i'm lowering ldl cholesterol ldl particle are tab but i'm raising lp little a even samsumikas will tell you don't worry about it lp little a if you learn nothing else about our lp little a discussion is a minority ldl particle so even though if you have the small isoform of statin maybe raising lp little a a tad it's so blowing away the ldls that don't have apoa attached to it that at the end of the day you have less cardiovascular risk and that little excursion in lp little a concentration is probably meaningless now to go on to the second part of the questions the pcsk9 inhibitors don't have an effect on the synthesis of apoa in the body so at least they're not aggravating it in some people but we're still in our infancy trying to understand how lp little a particles are inner catabolized or cleared and it's probably due to multiple receptors the ldl receptor is part of it and a pcsk9 can give you more ldl receptors than a statin probably can putting aside the synthetic interference with it but pcsk9 they're finding has effects now on apoe receptors and three or four other lipoprotein clearing receptors that are expressed in liver and other cells or so so i mean that's there's got to be better clearance of the particles with the pcsk9 inhibitors than there is with ldl receptor expression with statins or statins plus whatever other apob lowering drug you're going to add to it or so so i think that's where we're at right now most of the time these people are going to wind up on statins plus pcsk9 unless they can't tolerate a stat and there's or there's another reason not to use a statin so that's my explanation right now peter that i think we touched on that a little bit in the last podcast and we still don't have a lot of info on clearance of lp little a particles and as you said it's quite variable i mean we've seen patients where they're on a pcsk9 inhibitor for other reasons and every time i put somebody on when i recheck their lp little a just different other reason than to gather our own data on how much of an effect the the drug either proline or repatha is having on lp little and there's the range is zero to sixty seventy percent reduction i mean that's literally how broad it is with probably a median reduction of a third yeah so two important points here one lp little a is not an acceptable goal of therapy because there wouldn't be trial dating even though we all think that's probably going to be good but i think most people like peter when he prescribes it sort of likes to at least see what happens to get his own information or so but realize that's not what you're making a therapeutic decision on per se is the lp little a concentration so uh just keep that in mind when you when you're following up on these people one last thing i want to circle in on you with that you and i spoke about a couple of years ago it was an experimental metric that was being bandied about in fact i remember you guys ran it at thd on some of my serum but i i don't know that it ever saw the commercial light of day which was i think it was like ldl triglyceride concentration have those tests ever seen the light of day i think if you look around enough you might find the lab it's a very easy assay denca makes it where you could get a an ldl triglyceride level and by the way just another thought jumped into my brain on that lp little a as i told you there are other things that attach to even ldls and hdls that make them less clearable or more atherogenic and a very recent study show believe it or not there are lp little a particles that carry apoc3 you're not going to clear that particle if you make it so the double whammy yeah oh my god but anyway back to ldl triglycerides people i often tease them if you said you know what we're really cost effective we're only going to allow you to have one lipid concentration on this person nothing else i would tell them give me an ldl triglyceride level certainly not an ldl cholesterol level and remember april b is a lipoprotein metric not a lipid metric so that's what i would really take but the triglyceride part of the core of any lipoprotein has a lot to do with plasma residence time of that particle what else might be attached to that particle even i i alluded to it a little bit in my brief hdl discussion before dan rader calls them fat hdls what if your hdl particle is not carrying very many cholesterol molecules it's carrying triglycerides well he's shown god that was a decade ago to those fat hdls meaning triglyceride and rich are dysfunctional they're carrying some of the bad stuff that hdl's uh carry that don't allow them to do their cardio protective functions so if triglycerides gets into an ldl number one what happens to an ldl that's floating around and it might still be a big ldl because it's full of triglycerides it's not cholesterol but it's a has a very great affinity for lipase enzymes that line our arteries or the surface of the liver so hepatic lipase is a very potent triglyceridase phospholipase that is just like a fly trap looking for flies it's looking for triglyceride enriched hdls and if it binds to it it will extract hydrolyze the triglycerides so if i had a ldl full of triglycerides and i pulled the triggs out what am i left with well that's an ldl particle that's lost a lot of surface phospholipids as well as a lot of core triglycerides i have the so-called small ldl or dense ldl i try not to use both adjectives together because they're redundant and we have plenty of evidence that yeah it's no good to have an increased total ldl particle count but if trying not to have too many small ldl particles because the evidence has certainly emerged that particle for particle they're probably more atherogenic than the more buoyant larger ldl particles for a variety of reasons and the bigger non-triglyceride-rich ldl it might be a better fit for an ldl receptor it's going to clear it so ldl triglycerides basically if you told me it was high i know you probably got a high ldl particle count apob i know you have the small ldl particles i know where those triglycerides probably came from your vldl triglyceride rich particles your cholera micron particles and when they traffic transfer to triglycerides to ldls they become remnant lipoproteins which peter has alluded to and you can bet those same triglycerides are invading the hdl particles contributing to hdl functionality and last but not least in the studies where they've looked at ldl triglyceride many of the inflammatory markers are high because those particles set off the inflammasome in various endothelial cells and elsewhere so it's a really simple easy to do metric that could tell us so much and i think if i saw what was up the first thing i'm saying up i'm dealing with an insulin resistant person because that would be the most common cause not some genetic triglyceride problem right and again i think perhaps the reason why people aren't leaping up and down to to bring this to market is you know frankly if you're looking at vldl cholesterol and you're looking at all of the markers of insulin resistance along with the lipoprotein markers we've discussed i i think you get the story and look i mean taking a step back let's play devil's advocate for a moment i think that it's worth doing apob over non-hdl cholesterol there are some people who are so opposed to advanced lipid testing that they will argue as long as you have non-hdl cholesterol you don't even need to measure apob because of course the non-hdl cholesterol is measuring the ldl cholesterol but somewhat correcting for the additional vldl by adding the vldl cholesterol cholesterol what is your take on the idea of non-hdl cholesterol versus apob as they are somewhat proxies for the same problem well i'm in a schneiderman school he's published on this extensively i find it all right it's probably gives you a little bit more information for the reasons you just described versus ldl cholesterol yeah beyond ldl cholesterol but as sniderman has clearly shown in several studies even though non-hdl cholesterol correlates with april b a little bit better than does ldl cholesterol there's still 20 30 percent of the population in our diabetic sensory system where they're discordant and where there is discordance even with non-hdl cholesterol in apob risk follows april b so why am i wasting my time with it uh you look it's all useful it might help you pick what therapy you want to use but at the end of the day i see no need to follow your non-hdl cholesterol following april b because i'd be a fool if i told you i normalized your non-hdl cholesterol and i've eliminated your lipoprotein mediated risk until you measure the quantity of these particles and if we ever got a quality test that's a silly thing to say to a patient yeah exactly we saved three dollars yeah and we might spend a little time you're very good at explaining it how do you determine vldl cholesterol in your patients peter you're not dividing triglycerides by five the old free-to-wall formula no so we use a lab that that is actually giving a vldl cholesterol and even if they didn't do that we would still take total cholesterol and subtract from it ldl cholesterol and hdl cholesterol not perfect either because in that situation sometimes the ldl is calculated but i always do a back of the envelope trig divided by five it's not close enough no that's true and listen you made a key point here which maybe went over people's heads you cannot do that calculation if you have a calculated ldl cholesterol you must have a directly measured ldl cholesterol because total cholesterol is ldl cholesterol vldl cholesterol and hdl cholesterol so if you subtract a directly measured hdl cholesterol a directly measured hl cholesterol in effect you have a directly measured vldl cholesterol which in our current world is about as close as you're going to get to an evaluation of remnants i think in our last podcast we talked while there are exceptions to that rule and that's a more complex discussion but please you can't get vldl cholesterol using the free to world calculated ldl cholesterol all right let's talk a little bit about therapies statins have been around forever they still take up most of the air in the room they are the workhorse of lipid lowering therapy is there anything new and exciting to talk about i would say that there's no new statin on the market today that wasn't there two years ago is the most recently introduced statin uh livolo yeah and that's probably ten years ago introduced now so what what what do you make of that tom why why are we not seeing more statin innovation two things i think third-party payers would never pay for a new branded statin they're going to always insist you use the cheapest generic that's appropriate to the degree of ldl lowering that you need soda and there are seven of them on the market now so i don't think a bean counter at some pharma is looking for let's get a new statin we're well aware of potential downsides to statin things we have to look for who tolerates them who doesn't i don't know that they're somehow going to invent a new statin that brings none of the potential downside of a statin to the equation so they're looking at other uh therapies that will now that we understand it's atherogenic lipoproteins that will reduce that and if your investment pays off you'll have a branded product for x number of years and you might get a little return on your investment so i don't think we're going to see another statin right now the biggest thing that's happened with statins and in the garden you know in the old days when we had nothing else to do and we didn't know a lot about all this lipoprotein stuff is hey you got this most trivial elevation of some ldl metric mostly ldl you're going out of staten i want them in the drinking water in the old days oh tom i just took a statin because they just reduce heart attacks you and i know there is an event reduction but there's plenty of residual risk even if you're aggressively using a statin so there always is more to the story but i think the newer guidelines give you a lot more ability to ascertain in a given individual after you do your thorough cardiovascular risk assessment you and i do our own risk assessment which is a little different than what the guidelines might offer but then once a person crosses a certain threshold of atherosclerotic risk then it becomes plausible to consider a statin and there's more to it than per se the ldl cholesterol level there's all those other factors that go into risk assessment and there are other adjunctive diagnostics now you earlier we briefly alluded to coronary calcium scoring lp little a they would be things that current guidelines says use if you're hammond or horn should i give a statin should i not or the patient i don't want to take it at least do a cac at least do an lp little a look at the family history as you mentioned look at the blood pressure other concomitant risk factors and factor that into do i want to use a statin or other apob lowering therapy so that's the biggest change with statins nobody's saying hey they belong in the drinking water you should carefully choose who you're advocating statin therapy to any sort of rules of thumb just in terms of the alchemy of this uh you mentioned that there are seven out there you know in our practice we really only pick from four of them livolo crestor lipitor and prevastatin i mean most of these are generic now and if you listen to the podcast with catherine eben which i know you did we are actually still pushing for branded whenever we can get it and if we're not getting a branded version of those we cross check with who the generic supplier is and we've seen differences right we've seen that a two versions of rosuvastatin can produce different outcomes so our default position is that all generics are crap until proven otherwise and that's why we use a tightly controlled list of of meds but i don't think i've ever prescribed simvastatin for example what what's your take on some of the older statins versus the i mean the reason i think we look at preva and livolo is mostly for the sensitive patient and then crestor and lipitor resuvastatin and torvastat and being kind of the workhorse yeah well you're just too young peter and old fogies like myself uh lovastatin or mevcor was the first statin that came around simvastatin was an accident pravastatin pravacal came so we have a lot of experience with those drugs but as time went on and pretty early on there was a pretty uh rational thing that whatever the reason pravastatin is a safer statin to use than simvastatin or lovastatin and it turns out that was mostly related to drug drug interactions where pravastatin is pretty clean subsequent to that the only statin that is even cleaner than pravastatin on drug drug interactions is the livolo so patavastatin would be its generic name so that's in today's polypharmacy world where and we're not only even talking about prescription products but the multitude of supplements or god knows what people wind up taking we have no way to check on drug drug interactions so you're probably going to get into less trouble with patavastatin or pravastatin of course along came rosuvastatin many years later after pravistan and it shared some at least pharmacokinetic attributes with the uh pravastatin that it was a hydrophilic statin kind of hepatoselective but it was way more potent on a milligram basis than travis statin so it became a and over that evolution of all those early stands yeah you know every three years we had lower and lower and lower ldl metric goals which weren't there when we first started so what used to be acceptable was no longer acceptable so it was very easy to transform from the hydrophilic privacy statin to the way more potent hydrophilic reservostatin and that pretty much was my statin of choice thereafter unless you had a putts around because of statin intolerance where you you would try some of those other things personally once all this was known and once resumed statin hit the market i don't think i ever prescribed another lipitor dose again unless you know third-party payers are influences here they sometimes tell people you either take this one or here's what you're going to have to pay if you don't go on our formula so that can factor into its use now lipitor is a potent statin milligram per milligram it's not as potent as rosuvastatin but you can get whatever ldl reduction if you use a higher dose of lipitor as you can with a somewhat lesser dose of resume statin so unless a third party payer is telling me to use it i'm probably not going to advocate lipidor just there are more drug drug interactions and it is lipophilic there's perhaps other issues at play you and i have talked about statins ability to get into the brain and everything where lipophilic statins might be have a little more bit propensity to do that than hydrophilic statins so there are other issues at play that would influence where you're going the other thing that and i'm going to disagree and i think it's the way you practice too all of the guidelines right now say okay you've made a decision to use a statin pick the two most statin the most potent statins that means you're on lipitor or crestor and prescribe it at the maximum dose uh because the way these trials were designed you know lower is better they all start you know they very few trials where they took people with minuscule ldl cholesterol levels and through statins atoms so they want you to get hey the clinical trial shows this statin at that dose works maybe there's pleiotropic effects that that statin is doing too so how do you know you have to be evidence-based i don't buy it i think virtually all of the statins contribution to atherosclerosis reduction is april b reduction and i think you've known me long enough that rather than maximizing a statin using the gorilla dose day one i would prefer to start with a smaller dose again depending on your risk and your metrics i mean if you're coming off an acute coronary syndrome and your ldl metric is off the chart okay i'll start with a big but i'd rather take that baby statin meaning a lower dose of a statin and perhaps optimizing it with a second apob lowering drug and for the longest time we had a zetamide which has since been proven in clinical trials to further reduce benefit and also in mendelian randomization trials looking at the neem and pick protein and now we have the new guy on the street this ben pedoic acid which is a weaker cholesterol synthesis inhibitor affecting an early on cholesterol synthesis step also that has mendelian randomization support and if you can't use a statin or if you can use a statin if you add the studio statin or even the triple therapy statin is that my bendpedoic acid maybe you can avoid the expensive pcsk9 inhibitor so we have a lot more therapeutic options nowaday peter and then talk about the differences in the synthetic pathways between these two drugs or where are they targeting the synthetic pathways and what makes them different is one more hepatic selective or is it really a question of potency with respect to where they're blocking the chain yes the cholesterol synthesis pathway something like 37 steps each step has its own different enzyme catalyzing catalyzing the transformation of these precursor products into the next down the stage statins happen to inhibit what's called the rate limiting enzyme it's the third step in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and of course that's modulated by the enzyme hmg coa reductase statins pretty significantly in a dose-dependent fashion inhibit that enzyme so you can seriously slow down cholesterol synthesis in various cells the one cell we really want to do it in is the liver because that's the cell that has the greatest propensity to upregulate ldl receptors that can clear our apob containing particles so statins do that now if you can deplete cholesterol pools beyond what a statin can do in the liver you will express more ldl receptors so when we use azetymi we block intestinal absorption of cholesterol or back flux of biocholesterol into the liver further depleting hepatic cholesterol pools you will get more expression of ldl receptors so now we have this new benpedoic acid it's called an atp citrate lyase inhibitor well the first step in cholesterol synthesis is citrate native mitochondria coming out of the krebs cycle is transformed to acetyl coa which boom then goes down and becomes after it becomes hmg and then the subsequent things so this ben pedoic acid is called an acl atp citrate lyase inhibitor but it's a pro drug you swallow it it's only uptaken by the liver and it inhibits an enzyme in the liver that you can't make acetyl coa so hey the less acetyl coa you make you're going to make less hmg and then therefore that's gonna you'll have less substrate for the statin to add on to so collectively you get additional apob lowering the cool thing is because one of our biggest downsides to statin is people get these myopathic symptoms be they weakness muscle aches or whatever you know that it's a big problem with statin therapy probably more prevalent than what clinical trials would show us but this bempendoic acid does not have any uptake in the muscle cells there's a specific receptor that pulls it into the liver so it is hepatoselective lucrazumastatin is somewhat heteroselective because there is a special cellular receptor that pulls in resume statin but other cells can pull resume statin reservoir statin can give you muscle aches so it's not quite as hepatoselective as vampiric acid do you know what they saw tom in the trial versus placebo for muscle soreness because even pcsk9 inhibitors still had some noise with respect to muscle soreness even though mechanistically it's not entirely clear why whereas at least the statin there's some explanation as to why someone could experience muscle soreness i'm just kind of curious as to what the head-to-head yeah no they did look at that and it's not zero so there are still people who but they've also shown studies that you can give you give a placebo when people get muscle likes too so but it's you know and they did comparative trials versus a statin versus placebo and there is definitely less with it or so but it's not going to be zero so it's worth a trial if you're really hung up so i think right now it's use and it rem the fda approved it the fda says look you've got to go do a big outcome trial which the company is doing but mendelian randomization suggests it would work before we ever had outcome trial with zeta my mendelian randomization data suggests that that reducing cholesterol intestinal absorption would reduce cardiovascular events and that turned out to be so so and uh they all i had to do was a certain amount of phase 3 safety trial and the fda let it come on the market and its use was you can add it to a statin in people with familial hypercholesterolemia who the statin probably is not going to get you to go by itself and you can combine it to that or even very high risk people where you didn't blow your ldl c down to 70 or 50 whatever you're trying to do it you need a junk of ldl cholesterol april b lowering you can co-prescribe the ben pedoic acid and they also allow you to co-prescribe azedimide with it in fact the company that manufactures this and the brand name is called nexitol they also have been given fda approval because there are a lot of statin intolerant people out there or people who need triple ldl lowering therapy that we're going to give you a combo product which is ben pedoic acid plus a zetta mibe i guess it's priced a little cheaper so rather than swallowing two pills you could just take that combo pill you could add it to a statin or not and look i think for the nightmares of the world you could ultimately if you had to add pcsk9 inhibitor at the end of the day if you're good at individualizing your therapy i think we have four april b options now a day and you're going to get down a fairly standard path because not everybody can afford a pcsk9 inhibitor or not everybody might be at the type of high level risk that the fda wants you to be at to or the third party payer wants you to be at but it's a fun time to be in the 80b world we have a lot of therapies and we're not even talking about addressing triglycerides which there are therapies that do that that might contribute to april b lowering also the statin works a lot by the hepatic upregulation of the ldl receptor do we think that's the case here as well or do we think that this is more about the actual reduction of cholesterol synthesis but remember if you inhibit cholesterol synthesis you're going to deplete the chronicles of cholesterol which will through the steroid regulatory element binding protein up regulate ldl receptor expression perhaps some vldl receptors or other things like like that apoe receptor so who at the end of the day probably depleting hepatic cholesterol pools is what you have still it's primary driver so so really at least on some level benedict acid is attractive because it's more hepatic selective even if it's less potent and remind me again what do we think is the relative potency compared to if you look at its monotherapy trials it's like a zettabyte you're going to get anywhere from a 10 to 18 percent lowering of ldl cholesterol by itself a tad less april b 10 to 12 percent if you use it as a monotherapy as you know what is edamame with statins there's a wide range of responses i think with all these drugs there are hyper responders middle of the road responders and hypo responders and i think uh that probably has a lot to do with how much synthesis of cholesterol how much absorption of cholesterol what type of ldl receptors do you make or express there's a lot of factors at play but if you want a generalization that's what it is and now you alluded to it but what do we think about in terms of what's changed in the last couple of years in terms of our thinking about epa and dha specifically well two things and it's been a long time and i nobody has respected triglycerides more than i have been lecturing about triglyceride rich lipoproteins forever and i knew despite all the nonsense that it doesn't matter what you do to trades you don't reduce events like you do with ldl cholesterol because of improperly designed trials and enrollment of people who basically didn't have triglyceride issues and giving them triglyceride lowering drugs but anyway we're far enough down the road that not only does the mendelian randomization trial certainly suggest look there are certain genes that are involved with triglycerides that are seriously involved with atherosclerosis so it's very plausible if at least through those mechanisms we improve triglycerides you're going to reduce disease so for the longest time what was our other than lifestyle what was our way to lower triglycerides we had niacin around forever we had the emerging fibric acid story which progressed progressed progress until they terribly improvised trials that were done to let's see if fibroids work they didn't give them to anybody who had high triglycerides so of course the vibrate didn't work but there's always been this hey omega trees uh really are a potentially triglyceride lowering drug and maybe we should use them anybody who's known bill harris for the longest time as i have you have no yes omega-3s if you really want to get triglyceride lowering from an omega-3 you better be using serious serious doses of you don't give a gram you don't give 2 grams if you want to get rid of triglycerides or better yet triglyceride rich lipoproteins if there are other attributes to omega-3s we have no way of measuring that now and there almost certainly are because you know omega-3s are a crucial part of cell membranes and cell signaling but if we're just going to deal in our lipid world and you want to have an omega-3 on board to help you combat triglyceride rich lipoproteins you want to have a maximum dose which looks to be 4 000 milligrams a day so this was the belief bill used to always listen don't tell me that you gave somebody a thousand milligrams of omega-3 and you didn't reduce heart attacks the odds are strong you could never reduce heart attacks with that drug you know so now we got confused because as we started to realize this they started to do trials with okay let's give four grams of omega-3s and let's really not make the fibrin mistake put them in the drinking water let's enroll people into these trials who have high triglycerides many of those people also have concomitant low hdl cholesterol but that necessarily doesn't have to be an entry criteria but you better have a triglyceride level above a certain degree or we're not going to waste our money giving omega-3s to people with triglycerides of 42. and lo and behold the first trial that started to come down the pike was done in japan said god probably almost a decade ago to japan epa trial you know japanese people eat a lot of omega-3s so they have higher baseline levels anyway so they just gave them for whatever reason epa only on top of a statin and they didn't necessarily have to have high triglycerides but many of the people did and lo and behold although it was not a blinded trial the evidence was pretty good that wow this is really plausible that epa at a high dose four grams a day reduces macrovascular outcomes when given with a statin that of course is working on the ldl metric you're looking at so you know of course people say aha that's proving omega-3s work nobody was given a lot of credence perhaps other than the people who produce it that oh this is unique to epa most people are taking omega-3s or taking some combination of epa and dha but as long as you're going to take 4 grams of that why wouldn't it do exactly so here's what happened so after that epa trial the company that makes the branded epa medication which is vesipa amaran is the company did a major clinical trial called reduce it where they enrolled people with who were taking whatever statin they had to take to get their ldl cholesterol below 70 and in general these were high risk people they had some degree of carnage disease or they were full-blown diabetics or had a lot of cardiovascular so it wasn't a low-risk primary prevention type of study you had to have a triglyceride above 137 to get into that trial most people it was 150 but you know the triglyceride assay always varies plus or minus 15 points so they would let you come in if you had a 137 because they thought in a week you're going to have 150. so they enrolled people that was the cut off you had to have that and lo and behold and you were maximized on whatever statin it took to get your ldlc under 100 at the time pretty good and lo and behold and we haven't come up with much in the world so far at least it has a big trial saying we lower residual risk with a statin isetami did it in acute carne syndrome survivors to a certain degree but this high-dose epa two grams twice a day with food because it is an ethyl ester theoretically it needs to be esterified before it's absorbed there was almost a 30 residual risk reduction that's mind-boggling to be on after taking a statin but there were still say oh that's fantastic we all have to start using omega-3s at the appropriate dose way more than we ever did but a lot of believers and i think probably bill harris and myself said yeah but we could also just give 4 grams of epa plus dha because deep down many of us believe dha is a pretty important omega-3 fatty acid too if for no other reason in your brain needs it but i believe all cell membranes need to a certain extent and not everybody can convert epa to dha although most people probably can so astrazeneca had acquired a free omega-3 fatty acid meaning it's not an ethyl ester which means it has a better absorption better pharmacokinetics more bioavailability and it was called epinova but it was epa and dha but free epa and free dha and they enrolled basically the same type of people high triglycerides maybe the hdl cholesterol is low at-risk people and two years into the study the company just stopped the study it's never been published so we don't know but the reason was it's futility we're not seeing a signal at two years that it's gonna work so we're not wasting any more money on this yeah this this was last november right tom yeah i gotta tell you this caught everybody off guard didn't it because surely caught me it was certainly announced that the study was being stopped and i would say most observers myself included felt oh wow they're stopping it because the signal is so big and then they announced at the cardiology meeting actually it stopped because there's no signal yeah i'm a little surprised it hasn't been published yet are you and annoyed to be honest with you is there something they're hiding that didn't come out in that press release or the early discussion about it or so so are there subgroups in there where maybe yeah and i understand these trials are super expensive and where they say hey we're cutting our losses we'll have to take this out to five or six years before we ever see a signal and i wish they had done that but then they wouldn't have made the announcement i mean i guess to me the thing i'm trying to understand well they would have announced it if they're stopping it yes yes yes yes i'm saying but but if they were going to keep running it they probably wouldn't have made that announcement oh no and so the thing that i'm trying to wrestle with which i shouldn't spend any time on it i'll just wait till it comes out is how much of this is the vehicle versus the epa dha split you know you got to bring bill harris back on look technically that should if what we want to do is achieve a certain level of omega-3s in our blood be it in a red blood cell or a cell membrane where we would measure the omega-3 index which they did not measure in the reducer trial or whether you just want to reduce plasma free fatty acid levels and by the way that they did do in the reducer trial although it's not been published yet it has been presented that the efficacy of the epa only product highly depends on the level you did achieve with a serum so again to me that supports going with four grams a day don't think you can get away with two grams a day perhaps unless you're really checking the levels but even that would be guesswork so so to take home points right now people ask me tom epa or epa dha if i want to be evidence based and you're in that type of risk category i think you got to go with epa four grams a day what if triglycerides are below 150. what about the person with triggs 100 who still has residual apob risk yeah it's an unanswerable question right now i'm not afraid to keep using epa dha whatever the magical mystery effects of epa are which is you know are all theoretical at the given moment and they're checking a lot of biomarkers to try and explain this and it's all winding up in this massive inflammatory world that's maybe it's do something or self cell signaling world yes but your brain needs some cell signaling from dha too so if i'm gonna throw four grams of epa at you i as you know i'm a big advocate of doing the omega-3 index so if i'm giving you four grams of epa only but your omega-3 index shows me you have adequate dha in your system i know some of that epa is being converted so i'm kind of happy and i don't perhaps necessarily have to co-prescribe some degree of dha with you my worry would be what about somebody who's taken the 4 grams of epa and the omega-3 index shows you're still deficient in dha then i think you got to scratch your brain and do what you want to do and it might be hey let's start giving a little dha you know but i can't buy into the concept that a little bit of dha is negating epa maybe that's true and that's what the epa purists will tell you well hopefully we have some published data in the next six months that can at least give us a hint i don't think this study had enough in common with reduce it to answer that question but i think it could potentially give us a clue yeah and we're getting more and more data they're doing additional trials with epa and they're doing more sub trial analysis they've even shown some angiographic data with despite that great reduction residual risk if you actually look at plaque it looks a lot better when you're taking 4 grams of epa so that's pretty encouraging of that type of study anyway you know about predicting what a plaque image shows an event reduction but it's good nonetheless anything else on the pharmacology side tom that's really interesting to you especially in the last couple of years because i like the way we've sort of at least tried to bring people up to speed on what the big changes have been listen i still think fibrates are widely underused drug i think for the right person where you've through whatever method you use have identified triglyceride rich lipoproteins perhaps those where you clearly see insulin resistance their diabetics or their insulin levels are high that's where the fibre sub trial analysis shows miraculous things not only with macrovascular endpoints but with microvascular endpoints retina peripheral nervous system renal function so even though you might screw up creatinine a little bit you're actually improving egfr because of overproduction of creatinine which in that case is not reflective of egfr so i i think there still is a group of patients right now where fibric acids the purest fibric acid which is in a pro drug is that phenofibric acid still soldiers trilipics so i think if you have to use a fibric acid if at all possible that's the one to use and the good news is there is a new fibre permafibre pemmifibrate that's being invested in clinical trials it's called a sparm a selective p-par alpha receptor modulator that they're really high on and there's big outcome trials going on with that yet but you know nobody's going to be using that or thinking about it until those trials are stopped for good reasons bad reasons or published of course and get fda approval so i think there's still hope with the fibrates niacin is a dead drug i know there's going to be a lot of people listening to this who oh no it's not it's out of every guideline there's not a single guideline in the world that recommends you can use anything you want if you're stuck between a rock and a hard place and i certainly know there are lp little a advocates if you bring sam on he will still selectively use niacin in certain cases but few in the lipidology world still agree with that yeah and back to your point on tri lipics we we probably have three or four patients on it and man it's a world beater i had one patient who was probably i mean he looked like he had fh and he looked like he also had of course a familial hypertriglyceridemia i mean you couldn't distinguish them and even though you knew he was going to end up on both a statin and a fibrate at some point i just out of curiosity wanted to see what apob reduction we'd get starting with just the trilipic so his triggs were about 400 to begin with apob was over 200 the trilipics took him from a triglyceride of 400 milligrams per deciliter to about a hundred my memory serves me correctly and that that took the apob from wherever it was high 100s 200 down to you know somewhere between 80 and a hundred so that's monotherapy of trilipics which was not the intention but just in a stepwise progression showed you the potency and unless you're dealing with a super humongous high risk and acute carnage i don't think it's irrational to go down that route there are plenty of people who you have to battle over the head with whatever to convince them to use a statin and maybe it'll say well i believe in triglycerides you're giving me a triglyceride i'll work with you well let's see what the parameter clearly you picked the right person there whereas triglycerides were generating the apob particles and the multi-mechanisms on how fibroids reduce triglyceride had a beneficial effect i've actually with peter jones published data using nmrs on resume statin and phenofibric acid and you know in some people there were pretty nice reductions in ldl particle counts using phenol fibrin always more but when you looked at the particle analysis when you were even combining phenol fibric acid with the fibre excuse me with the statin you got way more dramatic remnant reductions with the fibrate than you ever did with the statin so another reason and almost certainly that person would trigger 400 there was some contribution from remnants in that person you would think so just don't forget vibrates a tragedy to me or young lipidologists are not being taught about it few of them can give you a dissertation on fibrates and how they work and what is their trial history god there's 40 years of trial history that you can always garner a little bit from any trial so i find that sad that it's not even being taught anymore and people bad mouthfully condemn it without knowing what they're talking about i always feel lucky to have been trained by dinosaurs well some of us have been around the block for a few times or so but you know us old dinosaurs when we meet you young brilliant guys you keep us if i want to still talk to this guy i got to keep up with this stuff because i know things i said 10 15 years ago are silly now because you got to keep learning you know that guys like you are really good for me that i i just can't rest on my laurels tom this has been has been a lot of fun we were supposed to do this last week and we had some technical difficulties so we postponed until this week and i'm glad we did because it was it was worth being able to do it and actually be able to look at each other through a screen as opposed to just have to do it by by phone and so i want to thank you obviously for your continued insight you make a great difference in our practice i guess i should fully disclose to people you are now basically full time inside a tia medical as a practice you're on the back side of things doing mostly research but we drag you into at least a third of our patient calls and we always consult with you on all of our cardiovascular cases so i hope you're also enjoying being back to clinical medicine somewhat even though it's at a much lower volume we certainly enjoy having you uh it's been such a wonderful part of if this is the finish of my career still being able to do this and you know although i know a lot of this lipid stuff to basic science i've always been what i i'm mike davis was a clinical lipidologist none of this lipid stuff is meaningful if you can't use it at the bedside and make individualized uh things so i'm just thrilled to be able to contribute to you and i think one day as you know i'm trying to write and generate and put more mortise into writing and that will become available to your followers and subscribers and so folks stay tuned for that and i will say maybe it's another podcast and are probably better people than me to talk to but the one thing we didn't get into today is the emerging genetic world genetic analysis of lipoproteins and specifically the genetic lipidoses fh who needs that type of testing who doesn't whatever you discover what can you do for it it's another whole serious podcast so other than that thank you for everything peter uh meeting you a long time ago in reno nevada was a big day in my life oh mine too tom thanks so much thank you for listening to this week's episode of the
