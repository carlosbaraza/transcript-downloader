This clip is from episode 345 ‒ Chronic pain: pathways, treatment, and the path to physical and psychological recovery

In this clip, they discuss:

- Pain Isn’t Just in the Body—It’s in the Brain – A breakdown of how psychology, trauma history, and neurobiology shape the pain experience and response to opioids
-  When Should Patients Be Taken Off Opioids? – A nuanced look at post-surgical pain management, risk factors for dependency, and the reality of individual needs
- The Science Behind Persistent Pain – Factors like early trauma, depression, and anxiety increase risk for long-term opioid use, and chronic pain
- Old Pain Models vs. New Science – From Descartes’ dualism to today’s biopsychosocial model, the understanding of pain has radically evolved
- No One-Size-Fits-All – Why researchers still don’t fully know who benefits long-term from opioids—and why we urgently need studies that ask this

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this excerpt from The Drive podcast with Dr. Sean Mackey:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment focuses on opioid use in medical settings, particularly post-surgery, and the factors that predict long-term opioid dependency. Dr. Mackey discusses the complex relationship between psychological factors and opioid use, emphasizing that what we traditionally consider "psychological" factors are actually neurobiological in nature. The discussion highlights the challenges in conducting comprehensive research on opioid effectiveness and safety, particularly in identifying which patients might benefit from or be at risk for long-term use.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Pre-operative depression and anxiety are significant predictors of persistent opioid use [00:01:10]
- Early adverse childhood events, PTSD, and trauma history increase likelihood of persistent pain and opioid use [00:01:10]
- Self-loathing component of depression was identified as a key predictor of persistent opioid use [00:02:47]
- Beck Depression Inventory was previously used but has been replaced by more modern tools [00:02:47]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Post-surgical pain management may include combination of Tylenol and NSAIDs for mild to moderate pain [00:00:21]

Risk Considerations:
- Pre-existing depression and anxiety increase risk of long-term opioid use [00:01:10]
- History of trauma or PTSD increases risk [00:01:10]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Tylenol [00:00:21]
- NSAIDs [00:00:21]
- Opioids (general discussion throughout)

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Beck Depression Inventory (historical use) [00:02:47]
- Modern depression screening tools (not specified) [00:02:47]

8. **References & Resources**:
Experts mentioned:
- Jennifer Haw [00:02:09]
- Ian Carol [00:02:09]
Organizations:
- Institute of Medicine/National Academy [00:04:48]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"When we talk about psychology and psychological factors, we're talking about neurosciences. We're talking about the brain and we're talking about specific brain systems, regions, networks." [00:02:09]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the current modern tools being used to screen for depression risk factors?
2. What specific non-opioid alternatives are being researched?
3. How do outcomes differ between patients who receive opioids in-hospital only versus those who receive take-home prescriptions?
4. What is the current standard protocol for post-surgical pain management?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] And the goal is we want to get you off an opioid, even oral, before you go home. Is that generally the stated objective of the medical system now is whatever opioids you're going to need, let's try to deliver that to you in the hospital. I wouldn't say necessarily because I think there are some surgeries that are going to clearly require um prescribing an opioid after surgery.

[00:00:21] Remember the day the name of the game is get people out of the hospital and have the care take place in their home and people are going to need some degree of pain management and analesics and those analesics can be Tylenol NSAIDs if it's more than uh you know mild moderate pain that may involve an an opioid. So how are you thinking about that? How are you thinking about extracting the value of the opioid and minimizing the risk of long-term dependence? What we have learned is that there are vulnerabilities that people bring to an injury or surgery and being placed on opioids that set them up for more likelihood of persistent opioid use.

[00:01:10] And we've characterized, we and others through research studies have characterized many of these factors. So um some of these factors include uh pre-operative depression and anxiety uh higher levels of catastrophizing [Music] uh early adverse child events. So, history of PTSD, history of physical, sexual, psychological trauma, all of these set up to have a higher likelihood of persistent pain and persistent opioid use. Now, you will note um all these things I said, most of these things I said, people would normally put under the psychological umbrella. The key message that I want to give people and I I think I think people

[00:02:09] I think everyone's getting this is when we talk about psychology and psychological factors, we're talking about neurosciences. We're talking about the brain and we're talking about specific brain systems, regions, networks. So we did a study several years ago. This was led by Jennifer Haw. Uh Ian Carol was a key player uh leader on this. And we found that uh higher depression scores pre-operatively predicted much more likelihood of persistent opioid use after surgery. And how are you screening for this? What tests are you using? Back then we used something called the Beck Depression

[00:02:47] Inventory which um standard instrument. We don't use that anymore. There's more modern tools. I thought what was cool about this, we did a factor analysis on the original paper and you can break the Beck down into different components of depression, anhidonia, cognitive blah blah blah. What we found is there was a particular factor that drove almost entirely that prediction of depression self-loathing.

[00:03:16] It was feeling like really bad about your So if you have someone who just suffers from not that anidonia is anything but unpleasant, but if they're only experiencing anidonia but no self-loathing, you would say, well, the risk isn't as high. Yeah. you know, conceptually your argument holds, but now I'm going to come back to a lot of the things that you write about, which is the danger of drawing inferences from small population studies and generalizing that to the rest of the world. Yeah. Especially without randomization because what you really would like to be able to see is you take a whole bunch of people in. You get their incoming metrics of anidonia, dthyia, self-loathing. You categorize all the arms and tentacles of depression. And then you randomize within each of those to with and without opioid strategies. Yeah. And then you I mean this is a very complicated thing to do, but if you want to know the answer, that's kind of the way you want to do it. That's exactly it.

[00:04:20] Unfortunately, there's not much will to do that in society these days. Even even in the world we live in today where we understand that for a nonzero potentially non-trivial segment of the population, the introduction to opioids that ultimately destroys people's lives is delivered by the medical system. I was on the Institute of Medicine panel now the national academy uh panel called relie and we did a report called relieving pain in

[00:04:48] America and I remember sitting around back in 2010 and we were talking about the state of pain in the country and where we needed to go identify a perfect vision and also identify what are the biggest research questions to ask and answer and I remember a really vigorous discussion here and the one that I put forward and others put forward is we need to better understand what is the long-term effectiveness and safety of prescribing opioids to people with chronic pain. Meaning, we need to figure out for whom opioids work. Um, today we still don't have an answer to that question and there's very little will to do it because the whole message in the scientific community is basically find non-opioid choices. So, there's not a lot of interest in funding the studies to figure out for whom it works. There is a lot of active interest still mainly through datadriven studies to find out who is at risk. But that type of study that you're talking about and others that are of longer term and bigger consequences, I just don't know when they're going to get done. Who's going to fund those? [Music]
