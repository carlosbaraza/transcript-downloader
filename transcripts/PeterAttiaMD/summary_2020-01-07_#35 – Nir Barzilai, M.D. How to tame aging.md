## Description

Original release date: 1/7/19

In this episode, Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging Research and expert in the genetics of longevity, discusses the evidence that metformin and rapamycin have anti-aging properties and how his TAME study aims to support this hypothesis in humans. Additionally, he describes the role of genetics in lifespan/healthspan and how it might affect important pathways such as IGF and insulin sensitivity.

We discuss:
-Nir’s background and interest in aging and endocrinology [3:30];
-History of metformin, and understanding the mechanism [11:15];
-Attempting to define insulin resistance [21:15];
-Metformin as a possible anti-aging drug [48:45];
-The TAME trial: Targeting Aging with metformin [57:45];
-Why Nir believes metformin can slow aging [1:16:30];
-The genetic gift of centenarians [1:28:00];
-IGF/GH and its impact on aging and chronic diseases [1:34:15];
-Genetics/epigenetics of centenarians, gene sequencing, CETP-VV, Lp(a) [1:49:15];
-Should you be taking HGH? [2:05:30];
-NAD and NAD precursors (NR and NMN) [2:30:00];
-Parting thoughts on metformin [2:36:15];
-Possible blind spots in Nir and Peter’s thinking? [2:43:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode with Dr. Nir Barzilai:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Nir Barzilai, founding director of the Institute for Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The discussion centers on aging, longevity, and the TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial. Key topics include metformin's potential as an anti-aging drug, IGF/growth hormone's role in aging, and insights from centenarian studies. The conversation provides deep scientific analysis while remaining accessible to general audiences.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Metformin inhibits complex 1 in mitochondria and activates AMPK pathway [1:21:42]
- IGF receptor antibody increased lifespan by 10% in female mice [2:07:53]
- Centenarians show genetic mutations in growth hormone/IGF pathway [1:34:38]
- TAME trial will involve 3,000 subjects across 14 centers [1:13:47]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Time-restricted feeding may be beneficial but optimal duration unclear [2:20:14]
- Fasting can significantly lower IGF levels [2:16:12]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Metformin:
- Standard dosing: Start 500mg QHS, increase gradually [2:24:30]
- TAME trial dose: 1500mg daily [1:13:47]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
Limited discussion of specific exercises, though mentioned in context of AMPK activation.

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Fasting impacts IGF levels significantly [2:16:12]
- Time-restricted feeding discussed but optimal timing unclear [2:20:14]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- IGF levels can range 92-250 for age-matched controls [2:16:12]
- Sleep patterns as potential marker for NAD+ effectiveness [2:32:41]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Nature paper on IGF receptor antibody [2:08:42]
- Josh Rabinowitz paper on NAD metabolism [2:30:44]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Metformin is a perfect tool to start showing the proof of principle here, but the future is much better." [2:02:35]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Optimal timing/duration for time-restricted feeding in humans
- Gender differences in IGF/growth hormone response
- Long-term safety data on NAD+ supplementation
