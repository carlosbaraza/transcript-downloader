## Description

Original release date: 6/8/20

In this episode, Eileen White, Chief Scientific Officer at the Rutgers Cancer Institute, describes the fundamental role of autophagy in the maintenance of health and prevention of neurodegeneration, cancer, and other diseases. She also goes into detail about the paradoxical finding that autophagy may benefit an existing cancer cell and help it to survive—a discovery leading to new possibilities in cancer therapy. We also discuss fasting (and molecules that induce autophagy) and the critical need to decode the proper fasting “dose” in order to improve human health.

[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast of my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode I guess this week is Professor Eileen white Eileen is the deputy director and chief scientific officer along with the associate director for basic research and the co-leader of the cancer metabolism and growth research program at Rutgers

[00:01:03] University Cancer Institute in New Jersey she received her bachelor's degree from RPI and her PhD from SUNY in Stony Brook and her postdoc with Bruce Stillman at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Eileen's early work focused on apoptosis but it was doing some of the work there that she stumbled upon etaf AG and that is the focus of our discussion today now if you're even remotely familiar with this podcast you'll certainly know that the concept of etaf adji has come up on so many previous episodes it is a fundamental pillar of health and maintenance of health we talk a lot about it in the context of fasting in particular I have wanted to sit down with Eileen for a really long time and I don't think this conversation disappoints although we certainly could have gone longer in this discussion we talked about Eileen's career and how it more from studying apoptosis into a toff eg we go into describing the regulation of at otha G both metabolically and otherwise and then we spend a lot of time talking about the role at otha G plays in both the prevention of disease and also the treatment of disease and I think this is where it gets really interesting especially around cancer and I think that that's potentially one of the most confusing aspects of the entire discussion on a toffee and that's actually one of the reasons I really wanted to talk to Eileen was to better understand something that at the surface seems confusing to me which is that at

[00:02:31] Hoffa gee seems to very clearly protect a person or an organism from getting cancer yet once someone has cancer it appears that a toff adji may disproportionately benefit the cancer cell versus the non cancer cells so we tease this idea apart along with talking about the amazing work that her lab has done to demonstrate the importance of etaf adji in preventing Alzheimer's disease in neuro degeneration along with the benefits of metabolic health and of course we do talk about the age-old question that many of you have heard me go on and on about which is how do we delineate and understand the dosing and frequency of fasting as a tool in other words when I talk about doing a fast of three days every month versus seven days a quarter versus five days a quarter how could we possibly get a handle on what the ideal strategy is and so we talk a lot about that as well and I'm actually quite hopeful that from this discussion comes some research that can shed light on that so without further delay I hope you enjoy my discussion on a tofu ji with Eileen white Eileen thank you so much for extending your trip in San

[00:03:44] Diego for a day to come and make time to talk with me about this stuff today oh it's my pleasure I'm looking forward to it I don't know if you remember this by the way but David Sabatini introduced us a few years ago do you remember and we had yeah I still have my notes from that phone call five years ago I took about 20 maybe not 20 that's an exaggeration maybe 10 pages of notes in my sort of journal and for probably would have gone back to those a dozen times in the last five or six years so I always appreciate it when people just pick up the phone and talk to total strangers for no reason so that's great well you are excited about the science and so nerds like me like to talk about science well let's actually start from there tell me where your interest in science came from was it something that was always in you from a young age were you just naturally curious yeah I've been asked that question many times before I come from a family where there was an interest in science my mother was a elementary school teacher and my father was a lawyer but he always wanted to be in science and all of our discussions were related a lot at new scientific discovery so from an early age I was introduced to science which was probably unusual and I then went to college and majored in science and biology and continued from there and I decided when

[00:05:14] I was an undergraduate I wanted to get a PhD in biology and I was very fortunate to go into graduate school in the department led by dr. Arne Levine who discovered p53 and that was an inspirational experience because he is got scientific insight that's absolutely incredible and then I went on to Cold

[00:05:40] Spring Harbor lab where I was a postdoc with Bruce Stillman and again another incredible scientist and it was an incredible scientific environment there were a whole cadre of investigators there that were making major contributions in the field of cancer at the time and it was just a very thrilling experience to be in an environment where once a week there was some fabulous discovery and everyone was excited about it there even I think two

[00:06:10] Nobel prizes awarded while I was there and I joined the faculty at Cold Spring Harbor after that and then I moved on to Rutgers and I had the fortunate experience of building a Cancer Center so when I went to Rutgers to be on the faculty there was no Cancer Center but shortly after I arrived they hired a

[00:06:32] Cancer Center of director Bill Hite from Yale and I joined him to help build what's now the Rutgers answer center or the Rutgers Cancer Institute which went from nothing to now there are multiple buildings there are 11 hospitals in our health system we have 240 something members of the Crockers Cancer Institute and we have we're a consortium Cancer Center with

[00:07:01] Princeton University and so it was very thrilling for me to not only have maintained my scientific interest by running a research lab but also helped expand and grow something from nothing where now we're treating large numbers of patients in standard of care and clinical trials and making large discoveries and moving cancer treatment advancing cancer treatment as fast as we can and how many years have you been at

[00:07:33] Rutgers I joined there in 1990 so I've been there for a long time but I moved about 12 years ago I moved from one research building to be physically in the Cancer Center where I could be more directly helpful so where in your journey did a toff adji piqued your curiosity it was purely serendipity so this goes back to when I was a postdoc with Bruce Tillman at Cold Stream Harbor

[00:08:03] I was given an oncogene to study at that time they had just sequenced the adenovirus genome they knew what genes caused cancer in the virus I was given one of those genes and said figure out what it does and that was a dream project for a postdoc and what I found was that this gene was a viral homologue of bcl-2 be Co 2 is a gene it's a human oncogene and it functions by blocking apatow

[00:08:35] SACEUR program cell death and so that was transformative to me and to go other people a while to realize the importance of that that one novel function of cancer is to evade cell death that field grew we and others Tribute cloning the other genes that regulated Patos asleep it out how it all the mechanism by which it worked and the pharmaceutical industry started developing inhibitors of bcl-2 to promote a pitocin cancer and that was the ultimate goal was to make tumour cells die and have a drug that will do that and once that happened the field of apatow sasai we accomplished what we had wanted to accomplish we understood everything and that led to the development of the first of many drugs that were in clinical trials and in fact my lab is still involved with taking those drugs and putting them in patients in optimizing their use in solid tumors so while the field of apatow sister to the point where things were being translated we made a serendipitous discovery we had engineered tumor cells to be unable to undergo apatow --ss they were refractory to being able to commit suicide can we pause for a second there

[00:10:10] Eileen and just let's explain to folks exactly how apoptosis works because shortly we're gonna obviously contrast this with a toff adji they have common threads but they're different so let's go down the the path of what does it take to get a cell to undergo programmed suicide so there's a family of proteins called the bcl-2 family they come in different flavors there are the B co2 like proteins which inhibit apoptosis so they keep tumor cells alive and B co2 is a prototypical member of that family and is upregulated and amplified in translocated in many cancers to do exactly that and there are antagonize errs of B co2 and it's related proteins these are called the bh3 only proteins and they are often activated to inhibit B co2 to trigger apoptosis and then there's the core apathetic machinery that triggers a pitocin and this is backs and back they reside in the mitochondrial membrane and when they're triggered to undergo apoptosis they oligomers and poke holes in the mitochondrial outer membrane that releases proteins that activate proteases degrade the cell and be co2 and bcl-xl all the anti-apoptotic proteins are involved in in antagonizing this process and what are some of the things that would have to be going wrong in a cell for it to go down that suicidal pathway so for example mitochondrial injury that is a reversible genetic mutation that is unfixable like what are the suite of things that basically take a cell down the path of I can't fix this and being around here and replicating is going to be dangerous to the host I got to take myself out of the game right so mitochondrial damage in certainly trigger apoptosis but probably the best way to explain it is by using the example of p53 so p53 is a tumor suppressor and a transcription factor and some of the transcriptional targets of p53 are proteins like Puma and NOx which are these antagonize errs of vco2 and activators are back stand back p53 is a tumor suppressor one of the functions is to promote apatow system en't an emerging cancer cell from progressing one mechanism by which p53 does that is by turning on the transcription of Puma and knocks ax and then that will antagonize vco2 and initiate Apatow sious so then the question becomes what activates p53 to do that that could be a long list of things from DNA damage from oxidative stress and so forth so you could think of something bad feds - an emerging cancer cell and then p53 gets activated and one of the tumor suppression functions of p53 has to turn on these promoters of appetizers that antagonize VCO 2 now loss of function in p53 probably accounts for half of all cancers correct right and I assume that you have to lose both copies of it or is losing one copy sufficient well what happens in most of the time is not deletion of p53 but rather a point mutation that reduces function it's more of a dominant negative so in fact there's even evidence that there's a gain of function so there are hotspot mutations in p53 that are very common in cancer and p53 functions as a heterodimer and what these mutant p53 s do is that they end up entering into a dimer with bio type subunits and that interferes with the function of the complex so yes in that respect it can be well loss of function of the p53 heterodimer but there's evidence that it not only causes a loss of function but it actually may do other things as well that are cancer promoting that's just a great example of the nuance of evolution right I mean in med school the classic teaching you know 100 years ago for me was p53 loss-of-function unko gene gain-of-function black and white of course it's never black and white right so what is the wreckage of apoptosis so when a cell undergoes apoptosis - everything outside the cell inclusive of the immune system what becomes visible in other words does an a poptart excel once it dies elicits any immune response or does the process of apoptosis yield sort of an inert body of cellular matter that just goes away I'm not so sure I'm the best person answer that question I think the whole idea initially was during the process of Apatow sious you would get protein degradation and packaging of pieces of the dead cells into these apathetic bodies and then that would reduce inflammation and then there's evidence that macrophages can then go and take up these apathetic bodies and that may facilitate antigen presentation and so forth so it's possible for example that if you have a cell that has become cancerous either through a gain of function loss of function but whatever there's some mutation that now renders this cell to go down a pathway of cancer it fortunately it undergoes the a pop tonic transition the macrophages take it is it likely that you get an immune response to that that is protective in the long run against similar mutations because I mean even though the macrophage is part of the innate immune system does that ever translate to the adaptive immune system such that you gain some long-term immunity from that specific type of mutation yes I think something like that occurs and I'm just thinking the wrong person to answer that question I could give you the better names of people that can do a better job but the I think the best way to compare it is to contrast it with necrotic cell death so in a pitocin have proteolytic degradation and of a cell and packaging it into these bodies and you say well does that limit inflammation well the way to explain how it does is to compare it to a different form of cell death like necrosis so necrosis is cells lyse and that is very pro-inflammatory you have nucleic acids released you have essentially everything is released including mitochondrial content which is probably the most immunogenic given it's bacterial origin of the DNA absolutely and so apoptosis may be what I'm hearing you say is a prognosis is much cleaner than necrosis absolutely so now let's talk about a toff adji let's contrast the Tov G with apoptosis that's right well before we get to that I should go back to your original question of like how did we start working on on top of G then this sort of bridges us to what you just mentioned so when we disabled a pitocin a cancer cell it can't commit side and we're doing that all the time and we could show that then the tumor cells become more tumorigenic but what we didn't expect was the extraordinary propensity for survival we could leave the cells out and put them in buffer they wouldn't die under extraordinary circumstances that we couldn't explain so why would a cell that just couldn't commit suicide survive in buffer with no nutrients at all and just for context this is the mid 80s late 80s this is the mid 80s no it's probably later than that it was probably early 1990s and so it was a conundrum I mean just because a cell can't commit suicide doesn't explain how it can be a cancer cell can just sit in buffer and be fine and we puzzled over this like how can this be and then we discovered that what these cells had done was turned on autophagy and we're using that for survival before you go down that path help me understand something what did you observe about those cells that were sitting there in the absence of nutrients surviving did you notice any metabolic changes that were unusual like what was your clue that they were able to usurp the environment they were in it was an act of desperation we tried a bunch of things and nothing was informative and then I told the people of lab why don't we just look at these cancer cells onto the electron microscope and that way we did we could see everything because we couldn't understand how they could be surviving a buffering when we got the electron micrographs back we saw something we had never seen before and all these double membrane vesicles all over the cell and so that when we finally fit all those Arado phagosome which we had never ever seen but wait how did you I mean first of all this is just to me one of the beautiful moments in science that I think

[00:20:02] I think it's so important for people who don't do science for a living to understand that while science is 99% failure every once in a while you have a moment like that a Eureka moment yeah it probably makes up for ten years of failure yes when you realize in that moment you are seeing something that has never been seen before and therefore this is the cusp of new knowledge that's right that's happened to me a bunch of times in my career which is fortunate and this was one of those moments and then we started reading or what are these a lot of Fagor zones what do they do and then when we realize from when we looked in the yeast literature they were meant to capture interest so their proteins and organelles and bring them to the vacuole of the mammalian lysosome for degradation and recycling and that this was a mechanism by which yeast survived starvation and what was the tumor line or what was the cell line you were doing this in at the time we were using kidney cancer cell lines mice or human these were Mouse but it was basically the first time this had been seen in mammalian cell line no

[00:21:12] I think people had seen or order phagosome before I mean you got to remember in the olden days when electron microscopes were first available that that's one of the things that people did was describe all kinds of different processes so what a phagosome were known to exist but there was very very little information almost no information on autopsy and cancer at the time so we went into this area where there was almost no information and so the first question we asked is okay well the yeast data tells us that when you see Otto phagosome x' that means cells are starved and they're recycling and they're using this to survive and we hypothesized that that's what was going on in these cancer cells and if that was a case if Itachi was a survival pathway in cancer that was a game-changer we had to understand it we had to demonstrate that that's what was actually happening and then if that was the case if cancer cells had usurped the autopsy pathway for their survival then we needed to inhibit autophagy for cancer therapy the first thing we did was we looked to see what would happen if we inhibited or tapa G in these cancer cells and the answer was very simple in many many circumstances and many different cell lines that we looked at when you inhibit a tautology the survival of the cancer cells was reduced let me interject for a second and ask a question I don't know if you ever did this experiment but if you took the kidney line and the kidney cancer line so basically the same histology from the same tissue from the same animal but one has the oncogenic properties and one does not and you put them in the identical nutrient deprived stress can you quantify the amount of a toff adji or the efficiency with which those two cells undergo to average in other words is cancer simply preserving the at otha

[00:23:28] G capacity that it had as a non cancer cell but not enhancing it or not having any attenuation of it is it simply just hey this just happens to be something that gets preserved as you go from non cancer to cancer or is there some qualitative or quantitative change in the character of etaf eg as a cell mutates that's interesting so let me see if I could unpack that so if you have the general observation is that normal cells in the fed state don't have a tapa

[00:24:00] G on it functions at a very very low level and if you starve cells or mammals for nutrients then there's a massive operation of autop of G what was striking about the cancer setting was that even in the fed state etapa G was elevated ah so there is a fundamental difference there yep yes and then if you stress them it goes up even further but the problem is is that when it's already high how much higher can it go and just to be clear Eileen this is in vitro so you can't even make when you said that the first thought that came to my mind was well maybe the reason is they're undergoing a different stress which is for example a vascular stress a hypoxic stress because you know haven't got enough that Jeff or they haven't created enough in other words the apoptosis is going up despite being fed because there's something else that's impairing them but if what you just said is true in vitro then that wouldn't explain that would it in other words if they're not limited for oxygen if they're in a petri dish and this is happening my hypothesis wouldn't make sense that would only make sense if what you said was trying in vain right so in the fed state the cancer cells already have elevated autophagy flux and when you fast them it does go up but it only so high it can go I see so this probably you know it's really funny I'm sure you're familiar with the paper that Matt

[00:25:28] Vander Heiden in Luke Handley and Craig Thompson wrote in science in 2009 which was at least to my knowledge the first time that someone offered an alternative explanation for the Warburg hypothesis which is hey it might not be that the mitochondria of the cancer cells are defective and can't undergo oxidative phosphorylation it might be that they're optimizing for growth as opposed to metabolism they don't care as much about

[00:25:50] ATP as they care about building blocks and therefore they're deliberately taking an inefficient route of glycolysis to lactate because they want the cellular building blocks and that might be the explanation here is that the tumor cell is undergoing more constant proliferation and therefore they want more building block exactly right and in fact when we look at cancer cells and we study their metabolism what we've noticed and this is something that we found and it's been a common observation is that nucleotides seem to be rate limiting and so so the metabolism of a cancer cell is designed to facilitate de novo synthesis of nucleotides so that's really interesting isn't really something about like think of all the things that could potentially be rate-limiting to a cell think of how many phospholipids for example they need to build all of those cell membranes and yet it's the nucleic acid to continue to propagate its DNA that becomes rate limiting that to me is very interesting I wouldn't necessarily have ever guessed that we may learn more as going forward but that is what seems to be a recurring theme but it's not just DNA it's also RNA and you have to remember that RNA and ribosomes make up a huge amount they're much greater demand exactly and think David Sabatini has mentioned this many times that a large amount of the mass of a cell is ribosomal RNA and he had a beautiful paper where he was making the argument that ribose AG the autopsy of ribosomes was an important metabolic survival mechanism and you could think of ribosomes as being a Depot a storage depot for not only nucleic acids but also protein and when a cell is stressed or starved it doesn't need to make protein so it doesn't really need large numbers of ribosomes and so the autopsy pathway can cannibalize those ribosomes because they're unnecessary and then recycle all that protein and nucleic acids to support survival ammonia you mentioned of course that some of this had already been observed in yeast and the moment we start talking about things that are true in yeast and then true in animals mammals for example or higher adrenals we're talking about a billion years of evolution here so this ranks as one of the few things that seems remarkably conserved over evolution as a general rule that makes it very important do we have a sense of when this first showed up again I might be out of my league I mean I know it's certainly a big function in yeast prior to yeast I don't know yeah but it's amazing I mean it's sort of it's in the category of mTOR yes something that is so important that it just doesn't really seem to change over about a billion years rule-of-thumb it matters that's right and I think when you compare how yeast does autop adji and how mammals do etapa

[00:29:02] G and what they're using it for it just looks like mammalian version of Vltava G is a little bit more complicated it's probably they have probably more different circumstances where a taffy G might be necessary but the basic process is surprisingly the same what are some of the other stresses that induce a toff ægean let's maybe just for the moment even start with just in a normal cell so let me sort of resynthesize what we've talked about clearly nutrient deprivation is one of the biggest triggers for a toff a G and I mean maybe just for the sake of time I'll kind of throw this out there and you can correct me if I'm wrong but I've always sort of thought of this through three pathways at the sort of mechanistic level so you have sort of the mTOR pathway which is mostly sensing amino acids you have the ampk pathway which is mostly sensing energy and ATP in general and then you have sort of the acetyl co a protein deacetylation pathway which is also just basically sensing substrate of fatty acid and glucose is that sort of a fair way to say that those are three ways that nutrient low nutrients can still trigger the same pathway yeah and I think you could add on to that stresses that result in organelle damage such as depolarization of mitochondria or dysfunction of mitochondria activation of protein misfolding and generation of protein aggregates so

[00:30:34] I think there's the things that are directly related to metabolic signaling that you've mentioned but then there are other stresses that also can tie into the autopsy pathway are there other stresses like the nutrient there are stresses that come from outside the cell to inside the cell so that the protein misfolding the mitochondrial depolarization those are things that are occurring as damage within the cell that stress do we know anything for example about temperature do heat shock proteins stimulated hoffa

[00:31:03] G in extremes of temperature does exercise I mean which obviously is in the or term quite stressful how potent is that at inducing etaf eg in a normal cell so temperature-wise I would fully expect that temperature extremes would induce protein misfolding and induce autophagy as a remedy for that but I I don't recall any Studies on that in terms of exercise that's very well studied that exercise induces autarky very potent ly and you actually need or tapa g2 because exercise damages the muscle and ought Apogee is one of the processes that helps mitigate the damage that occurs during exercise what about hypoxia though potently hibakusya potently induces aw topper G Wow and in fact one of the first things we did was when we looked at tumors tumors are well known to have hypoxia in the centre when we engineered tumor cells to be genetically deficient for our Tophet a and you look at them they're completely

[00:32:15] Hollow I mean they may have no organelles nothing not the cells are hollow the tumor is hollow oh wow the further the cells get from a blood supply meaning the more susceptible they are to hypoxia they're dead right so if you take a tumor if the middle is hypoxic that's where your top of G is most active and if you genetically a blade on top of G in the tumor you end up with a hollow tumor because the tumor cells in the middle don't survive yeah so it does come back to this idea that we talked about earlier about hypoxia being potentially one of the things that etapa

[00:32:48] G is protecting cancer from absolutely how easy is it to create an animal model that is unable to undergo a toff adji how difficult is that from a knockout perspective well it's been done and we've done it and it can be done different ways so the original Mouse strains that were made were deficient in either of two of essential etapa G genes one called a to g5 and another one called a to g7 and these mice were developed in Japan and these mice are born but they fail to survive the neonatal starvation period so when mammals are born meaning once they are cut off from an umbilical nutrient source it's almost like they have a glycogen storage disease you know those conditions where you can't produce any glycogen but it's uniformly fatal if not treated the moment you're cut off from an umbilical source of nutrient right so that neonatal starvation period between the cut off of the placenta and suckling is a common feature in mammals and there's potent induction of etapa G during that period I can't speak for humans but certainly I would think so and in mice that's exactly what happens and so these are top of G deficient newborn mice don't survive wow that really I mean again I think that simply underscores the evolutionary preservation of something if you knock it out it is uniformly fatal do not pass go do not collect $200 you're gone and then what we did was yes a different question was like what happens in an adult Mouse so in the newborn Mouse it's a very different situation because any newborn mammal they don't have any fat or no reserves and so when the Japanese group did the extraordinary thing of trying to force-feed these or thathe G deficient newborn animals then they didn't extend their survival very much that was this Yoshinori group this was the Burmese Ashima and the Komatsu group

[00:34:56] I believe and I think it was coming from those two labs so what happened in that experiment they discovered that the mice died shortly after birth and then they realised that well they suspected they had a metabolic problem and they weren't suckling because they were probably too ill to by the time they were it would have been able to so they force-fed them and that allowed them to live for 24 hours but they still died anyway and then are you able to induce an ATAR G knockout in an adult yes so that's what we did because we realized that the newborn animal is it's just too fragile too fragile they've known nutrient reserves and actually in setting of cancer we're thinking of you want to treat an adult with a tumor so what's happening an autopsy and a newborn animal isn't even relevant and so we engineered mice where we can take an adult Mouse and give the mice a chemical so that inner central autop of gene will be deleted throughout the entire animal so one day they're an adult Mouse with autophagy and then a few days later there are an adult Mouse with no etaf adji and these mice were very extraordinary they live for two to three months and then they died predominantly of neurodegeneration autophagy is very important in the brain over the long term but if we fasted the mice they were all dead within 16 hours let's unpack that again that's pretty remarkable so you take a normal Mouse that's got through the vulnerability period of infancy and you genetically knock out its capacity for a Tov G the first thing you observe is if you fast it for 16 hours which admittedly is are pretty long fast for a mouse that might be the equivalent of fasting a human for a week but that degree of nutrient deprivation is uniformly fatal if you continue to feed them well they only survive another couple of months because they ultimately succumb to nerd generation suggesting that the role of etaf AG in preventing neuro degeneration is essential and it's really not surprising when you think about the role everything you talked about with protein misfolding and when you start to think about the toxicities that are driving neuro degeneration using Alzheimer's disease specifically as an example there's a lot of crap that's basically getting accumulated in neurons this would be an elegant way to suggest that a toughie G is keeping that at bay exactly right so one other way of looking at it is what tissues are more etapa G dependent than others exactly brain would be really important and there are a few others and what we noticed when we looked at the mouse the laktaw Thapa G when weijin ethically deleted the autopsy gene in the adult mouse was that there were tissues like the brain that were very sensitive and there were other tissues like the lungs that didn't have any phenotype so wait in other words when those animals ultimately die of nerd generation and you undergo the pathology analysis obviously the brain is where you see the cause of death you're saying in the lung it looked completely normal relatively normal what about liver liver was very sensitive so it doesn't lead to the death of the mouse so if you did a liver specific knockout of an essential etapa gene those mice have Tia ptosis and the liver gets huge and whatever but it doesn't kill them I mean they can live for quite a long time so you induce fatty liver disease yes so again suggesting that a toughie gee probably plays a role in preventing fat accumulation in the liver exactly right and also protein aggregate formation one of the other phenotypes of steatosis is the accumulation of these Malory bodies which are large protein aggregates composed of a protein called P 62 when you lose autopsy and the liver you're causing accumulation of fat accumulation of protein aggregates but the liver manages to tolerate it the brain however is a different story if you have post mitotic neurons where I don't have a

[00:39:22] Cabana they don't have a capacity to do that I mean when they accumulate the crap as you said then it's game over was there evidence that the brain in some last-ditch effort to survive was undergoing more apoptosis of neurons yes that's a common feature of these animals has increased capital in the brain but before that you see all kinds of terrible things going wrong this has been part of a major effort to generate autophagy stimulators as a remedy or as a means to delay neurodegenerative diseases I want to come back to this later on in the disk but I'll just plant the seed now obviously fasting is one of the most potent stimulators of etaf AG I spend a lot of time thinking about how does fasting fit into our toolkit of longevity a big part of longevity in fact probably the single most important piece of longevity when it comes to the lifespan aspect of it so you know you think of lifespan verses health span how long you live or how well you live on how long you live front I think it's very safe to say based on all of the animal data and frankly all of the centenarian data that the key to living longer is delaying the onset of chronic disease so even when you look at centenarians who are genetically gifted with tools to live longer if you unpack what the gift is it's delaying the onset of the disease not living longer once you have the disease so the centenarians once they get cancer and once they get heart disease they die at about the same rate over the same duration as the rest of us Schmucks the difference is they get those diseases twenty to twenty-five years later and again that suggests to me that if you want to live longer you have to delay the onset of these things not live longer once you have them and so it's hard to think that fasting doesn't play an essential role in that when you realize the role that fasting plays in the mitigation of Alzheimer's disease and metabolic disease of course what we're going to come back to in a second is cancer which seems to be this conundrum this is the needle we're gonna want to thread a little later down the line I'll plant the seed now but I do want to come back to the idea of ways that we can also induce a toff adji sort of pharmacologically or chemically the first thing that would jump to your mind is anything that mimics fasting the first thing that comes to mind would be metformin rapamycin things like that that what we talked about earlier just for the listener to sort of tie this together we talked about these huge pathways that tell the body nutrients are scarce so when mTOR activity is down that's a sign that we're deficient in amino acids but we can also do that with rapamycin when AMPK is up that's the cell being told we're deficient in ATP another way you can do that is to give metformin we haven't talked about sirtuins yet maybe I'll pause for a moment do we have any sense of what sirtuin activity does in a toff adji I'm not familiar with that liturgy okay I was gonna say because then you could get into the whole nad versus NADH ratios and how that might factor into it so again I'm really curious about this through a clinical lens as well which is what is these suite of products but almost just saying that out loud so between the two of us we remember to come back to this but I now kind of want to get back to your story which is we've got these mice you've got this much more elegant experiment now which is you're actually going after the phenotype of interest which is in an adult in which you inhibit etaf adji what was happening in that animal if it had cancer so did you ever do the experiment where you had an adult with cancer then you knock out a toffee gee that's actually one of the reasons we made that mouse so we had two questions we wanted to answer one was if you inhibited autophagy and adult Mouse what would happen because if they died in an hour than targeting otology for cancer therapy would be pointless especially if you can't do it specifically that's right so the answer was it in dying in an hour they died in two or three months which was actually good news because that meant that there was a potential window of opportunity for inhibiting otology for cancer therapy and I'm sorry Eileen when they died in two to three months was it still from the neurodegenerative disease and did they still have cancer at the time of death we had to first make a mouse that lacked where we could switch off at

[00:43:51] Apogee and find out what happened to that Mouse okay so we did that and we saw that they died of neuro degeneration in two or three months which was good they died immediately then we would have stopped there would be no point in trying to make answer on that animal but we did learn that they were intolerant to fasting which was perfectly consistent with everything we knew about what ought Apogee functionally did so then we moved to the second step was to do the experiment that you just suggested to make cancer in that Mouse and then after the mass had cancer - then shut the autopsy pathway off and then to ask the key question which died first the mouth of the tumor and the answer was the tumor died first Wow okay so then here's the gangster question once the tumor died could you reactivate a toff adji to prevent the neuro degeneration or is it a one switch direction that required a different type of mouse model so what we were doing was making a mouse with cancer and then once the mouse had lung cancer in this case we deleted an essential etapa G gene and the entire Mouse tumor and all but the gene was God so it wasn't like we could turn autopsy back on in that model but since then one of my trainees in collaboration with a lab in the UK they have developed a model where they can toggle autopsy off and then back on again and what they've seen is a remarkable capacity of the normal tissues to restore themselves so the experiment would be to have a mouse to induce an shrna to a specific or thathe - gene - down regulate the expression and inhibit or Tov G that way and then later on take that shRNA away or shut it off and restore normal autopsy in the mouse and you see a lot of capacity for the tissues to restore themselves back to normal so that experiment basically becomes the proof point that says targeting etaf AG and cancer makes sense that's probably the most elegant description you could provide a patent that's right I think it would be better if we had specific targeted therapies against some of the enzymes in the autopsy pathway because these are all genetic experiments and it's not exactly the same right you might not get the complete right raishin with a drug or inhibiting protease is not exactly the same as deleting the gene but this is all what's called proof of principle that the concept of inhibiting autopsies in cancer is valid so what do we know today about what you've just described as it pertains to two things I want to slice the data across two variables the first is tissue type or histology of cancer and the second is underlying genetic mutation so I know that a lot of what you're describing is clearly true in KS mutation what about other drivers we and a number of other cancer labs that use genetically engineered mouse models for cancer have been banging away at that for a number of years and what we've learned is that K Rast driven lung cancer and pancreatic cancer are extraordinarily hoppity dependent and you do it you know make the mouse models and the tumors are very susceptible to the functional loss of autop adji can you briefly tell folks what a KS driven cancer does like what is it about the mutation that drives the angka genesis so k RAF's is a GTP binding protein that is responsible for activating what's called the map kinase pathway and this pathway is very key and driving cell proliferation and so cancers have a mutation and rass or mutations and rafts that leave it in the GTP bound or on

[00:48:17] States so there's perpetual growth signaling through the map kinase pathway which of course is the hallmark of cancer which is it's unresponsive to cell signaling and when you are fixed in the on position you can't turn off and basically that is cancer that's right and what's particularly interesting about R astrovan cancers is that we have been very unsuccessful in drugging wrasse and there's recent hope that the cysteine the particular subset of the mutations and rafts that involve a cysteine residue that there are now drugs that target that there's hope after decades of failure is the primary issue in the failure to drug Rass that you can't do it without creating toxicity for other cells that are non cancer or that it has too many workarounds to whatever you put in place

[00:49:10] I think too many work arounds is the common problem what they've done is that they said okay of targeting wrasse is difficult and let's go downstream morass and try map Tiny's right right so there are inhibitors of RAF MEK and ERK which are downstream of rafts and those are actively in use in the clinic but they seem to be not durably effective in raster oven cancers because of the workarounds yeah so are there mutations or mutant drivers of cancer that we know are not dependent on a toff adji and unresponsive to the etaf

[00:49:51] AG blockade yeah it seems like there's a spectrum so rash driven cancers are particularly sensitive be RAF driven cancers like beer at v600e there's a common b-raf oncogenic mutation and those cancers are particularly sensitive and those the ones that were examined were lung cancers and melanoma the b-raf v600e mutation and on melanoma is very common homologous recombination deficient breast cancers and those would be well I mean those would be models of hereditary breast cancer those are very sensitive to loss of autopsy APC deficient colon cancer is another example what about non APC driven colon cancer which of course is the majority of it what do we know about that

[00:50:44] I don't think I can remember seeing a paper I remember the APC deficient model that's in fact the most commonly used model anything we know about prostate cancer or other hormone sensitive breast cancers so prostate cancer is sensitive we did that work and hormone sensitive breast cancer I'm not recalling right now but there are a long list of cancers that are sensitive the sensitivity is not all equal for example beer after two cancer's are very sensitive more so than raster in lung cancer so you just compare lung b-raf lung cancer to rasp lung cancer the b-raf mutant lung cancers more sensitive the most sensitive cancer that we've encountered is in fact rash driven lung cancer with lkb mutations and this makes a lot of sense to so one of my trainees who has her own research lab hypothesized that we sat down and we thought what cancer would be would you predict to be most autopsy dependent and it should be a cancer with loss of lkb1 lkb1 is a tumor suppressor gene that's involved in activating a NP kinase an A&P kinase activates autop adji as a survival mechanism to low energy and so there were a whole class of lung cancers that have lost lkb1 and as a result they can't activate this protective mechanism this is dr. Jesse grouchy made this mouse model rash of and lung cancer without lkb1 and lo and behold when you delete an essential on top of GG you abrogate tumorigenesis so it makes a huge amount of sense lkb deficient rash of a lung cancer is probably the number one sensitive tumor so how do we reconcile these two observations that almost seem to have a difficulty coexisting so the first is everything you've just stated which is pretty clear and unambiguously suggesting that a toffee G is at least for a number of cancers an important part of their survival and proliferation and we contrast that with an abundant body of literature that suggests that when you combine fasting which is a potent inducer of at otha G with chemotherapy for example you enhance its efficacy and we can speculate about why that might be the case these two things although not directly comparable seem a little bit at odds how do you think about those things I would probably think about it in a slightly different way so if you want to get at the two different roles of etapa G one is cancer cells usurping it and turning it on for their own survival then the other side of it is when we know that autopsy is protective we know what happens if you have a mouse without etapa G many terrible things happen it takes a while but the mice die of neuro degeneration can I interrupt for one second I'm sorry to do this but I just don't forget this question I want to come right back to your thought in those animals that died of neurodegenerative disease after two to three months did they show an increase in tumor Genesis in any other tissue no they don't but if you make a mouse where you bypass a neuro degeneration by knocking out an essential etaf G everywhere else okay but not the brain then those mice will get benign hepatoma so benign tumors of the liver but that makes sense to think about autopsy in normal tissues we know it's important because if you knock out a fat yet on a mouse there's tissue specific but gradual deterioration ultimately leading to neuro degeneration and you end up with steatosis looking a fatty liver disease the brain phenotype can be explained as we discussed before neurons and the brain need this protein an organelle quality control function their post mitotic they have to have a way of getting rid of the garbage in the liver what happens when you damage the liver it regenerates it's got infinite capacity that's right but what happens when you unless there's too much inflammation exactly so you end up with when you inactivate our tofu gene liver you end up with these chronic cycles of damage repair and chronic inflammation and that is oncogenic and that's not you know it's particularly obvious in the liver the pancreas as well it's very very sensitive to that inflammation so I think what this is something very important it's telling us that a main function of tapa G in tissue homeostasis is to preserve cellular function to be normal to prevent chronic damage and inflammation and tissues that are susceptible to cancer as a result of chronic damage and inflammation autography is highly protective which again think about how complicated this is now I'll bring us back to the question I posed a moment ago but using this example why does a novelty ultimately lead to cancer because if you have enough accumulation of fat you get enough inflammation you're gonna get about a cellular carcinoma saying with pancreatic cancer highly you know this is why alcohol is such a horrible molecule so toxic to the pancreas to the liver and you so those seeds of inflammation and lo and behold you're increasing this risk of cancer so on the one hand we know that at otha G helps ameliorate that it cleans that up it buffers that the same time we just realized a moment ago oh boy once you do get pancreatic cancer it's a K R as driven cancer at ah Fuji is helping it that's right so now let's come back to the question I posed a moment ago that I so rudely interrupted you and answering which was how do you reconcile these I think it's a matter of thinking of the role of etapa G in cancer as being context dependent on the one hand functional autopsy can delay the onset of chronic damage and inflammation that are known causes of cancer in particular tissues such as the pancreas and the liver amongst a few others so I think that stimulating aw topper G through fasting or through pharmacologic means at one point can be thought of as preserving health but once you have a cancer I think it's a different ballgame and at that point it's a completely different context and in that setting what we've learned is inhibiting autophagy is preferentially damaging to the tumor compared to the normal tissues and then going back to the other litter which looks at the efficacy of fasting combined with chemotherapy which is superior to just chemotherapy do you think that the reason for that is that the chemotherapy itself maybe once you you're rendering the cells more sensitive to chemotherapy and also potentially generating a more durable immune response because one interpretation of what you're saying is a person with cancer should never be calorically restricted I don't know that's a going too far I would say that yeah I don't know that you can equate caloric restriction with the loss of autopsy or regulation of autopsy because

[00:58:35] I think they're not equal things because I think that caloric restriction is limiting tumor nutrients and so I think what that's doing in the context of cancer therapy needs to be better understood I'm just not sure that we know what's happening there if I'm hearing you correctly you're saying look it might be that we can't necessarily say that fasting isn't helpful in cancer because while it may be counterproductive from the standpoint of a toff adji that may be offset by other things that are beneficial such as the reduction of overall nutrients and inflammation that accompany this exactly right yeah to me of all of the areas of etaf AG that have me scratching my head the most it is this question of given that fasting is one of our most potent ways to stimulate it in fact I would argue it's more potent than metformin which is an AM Pik activator more potent probably than exercise I mean it might be the most potent thing we can do to turn this amazing tool on how do we think about using it in disease prevention and disease treatment and they aren't necessarily the same thing

[00:59:43] I completely agree and in fact I would ask a question of you so there's a multiple efforts in the biotech industry to identify pharmacologic agents that are potent stimulators of Vltava G and I think their idea is is a normal healthy people will take a pill or tapa G will be turned on and there'll be some Fountain of Youth type yes / Madine is one of the things that people are talking a lot about right so why not cultivate well you so fasting instead I will tell you exactly why I leaned and you I love how you have fed into it's almost like you can read my mind and know where I'm gonna go with this discussion I think a big part of it is we don't have the tools to measure the signatures of etaf adji in other words if a patient comes to me and says

[01:00:38] Peter I want to do whatever I can to enhance etaf adji because I have now bought into the idea that it is going to basically protect me from every chronic disease I would say yeah I agree with you and they say great fasting seems like a great way to do it I'd say you're absolutely right and they say well how long do I need to fast Peter guess what

[01:00:58] I get to say I don't know and I'll tell you in reality what I say I say it Lola I'm really sure that after about seven days of nothing but water at otha G is fully cranked and I'm also really sure that if you just go 12 hours without a meal you probably haven't done anything where I struggle is where between them now I want to share with you some personal experience and I want you to weigh in on it and then I think maybe we can pivot off into actually kind of going back to what you and I spoke about over the phone and five or six years ago which is what would a molecular signature for a toff would you look like and again I think this is I put this in the top three most important translational questions in my field in other words as I think about the practice of medicine as it pertains to longevity it's our inability to understand how to quantify the benefit of nutrient deprivation in other words our inability to dose it that is our greatest certainly among our top three detriments to using this incredibly potent tool so

[01:02:03] I fast a lot I just finished a fast yesterday actually so I used to do a thing where I fasted seven days every quarter so four times a year I would just do a water only fast how hard it is it to do that it is not that hard I'm going to become lately honest with you I wish I could sit here and say off I'm a real stud nobody can do it anybody can do it

[01:02:25] I really think anybody can do it it's not to say that there aren't moments throughout those fasts where it's sort of difficult but you'd also be surprised at how resilient the body is so yeah not that hard you have to make some adjustments obviously you have to be very thoughtful about how much water you're drinking and how many electrolytes you supplement there are a lot of changes that are happening in terms of electrolyte management and things like that but again we certainly have the knowledge to know how to manage people through that but I began to ask the question right which is okay is seven days a quarter the right dose I'm convinced that it's a big bolus of etaf

[01:03:00] AG but is it frequent enough what about three days every month that's about the same number of total days fasted but it's more frequent but it's probably less potent and the reason I sort of decided to try three days a month was I noticed that a couple of things happened at the end of my fasts so I always check my blood before and after one of these seven-day fasts and there's a very predictable set of changes that occurs some of them that are really obvious glucose plummets insulin becomes unmeasurable uric acid goes through the roof along with beta-hydroxybutyrate of course two possible explanations for the uric acid going through the roof one is the breakdown of nucleic acid then obviously you know when I talk go through I mean doubling of uric acid so much so that I started taking allopurinol during a fast to make sure I didn't get gout of course it could also be and I've read something that says that uric acid and BHB compete for the same transporter in the kidney so there might also be a bit of a competitive blockade but nevertheless we have at least one possible explanation there endocrine function changes dramatically t3 goes down significantly and reverse t3 goes up significantly such that the ratio of them changes by four to six fold which means you basically shut off the metabolism not surprising explains why you become incredibly cold intolerant during a fast and also gonna addict Rauf ins go down so you have all these really predictable things well what I noticed was I see virtually all of them though not quite to the same magnitude after three days but not after two days so that just got me intuitively thinking in a hand-waving way that three days was sort of the minimum dose you needed to really move the needle on a bunch of these other metabolic things meaning the spike in uric acid they're bottoming out of glucose so there's another thing that sort of happens it's as you turn more and more free fatty acid into ketone and turn more glycerol into glucose you reach an equilibrium where your glucose is pretty much gonna stay at about three to four millimolar and that takes about two to three days and again when we think about it through the lens we've already discussed AMPK must be up through the roof mTOR must be through the floor and protein deacetylation must be off I think my Gestalt is that that takes about three days and obviously it gets greater and greater than the more you go but what would be amazing is if I could draw tube of blood send it to you after a three day fast a four-day fast five day fast a seven day fast a ten day fast and get some sort of quantification what is it that we would see in now of course it's complicated because you'd probably want to accompany each of those tubes of blood with a muscle biopsy so that you could look at LC 3 LC 2 and things like that so I'll stop on my diatribe for a moment and now turn it over to you which is where would you even begin to look for that signature of a toff a G and let's just start broadly with any tissue you can have blood you can have muscle you can have liver you can have adipose tissue how would you know create a dose effect well we do that what happens at a mouse let's just take a minute to discuss that so music

[01:06:19] I'm a lab made a mouse that had a transgenic LC 3e GFP protein expressed and that could use that Mouse tell folks what LC 3 is just so because we're going to talk about this quite a bit so LC 3 is the protein that is attached to the auto phagosome membrane and links to the cargo that ends up in the auto phagosome so there's a pretty mechanical thing like this goes back to your observation in the elec microscope exactly right so lc3 is one of the key proteins attached to the auto phagosome membrane and you use it to see auto phagosome because normally when our topic is off lc3 is diffuse but when

[01:07:06] Auto phagosome form the lc3 protein is attached to them and you start to see spots where all the Autofac isms are present and so the music she my lab used that to assess autop of G in a living Mouse they fasted the mouse and they found that they could see the formation of Olga fortify gazhams throughout the mouse and could they do this in like

[01:07:32] PBMC out of blood or do they need to use tissue they did it with tissue what they learned was that yes Lata Fuji is turned on during fasting in a mouse which wasn't surprising but it seemed to not be uniform across every tissue so that was interesting but we don't have a way to do that in people all we can do because this is involved making a genetically engineered mouse so the only thing we can do and people would be to look at a tissue section and stain it for lc3 and it looked to see if there were spots in other words you could not look at lc3 conversion in white blood cells you could but there's another problem in that you could take PBMCs and do a Western blot for lc3 and lc3 gets processed from lc3 one to two and the two form is the one that's attached to the auto phagosome membrane so you could do a Western blot though PBMC is to measure the conversion of one to two but then to ends up in the lysosome gets degraded so the typical measurement of what auto fat check flux involves measuring the rate at which the lc3 one gets converted to lc3 2 and then the rate at which lc3 2 ends up being degraded in the and in order to see that flux you need to block the degradation of lc3 too and the lysosome with baffle oh my son or hydroxychloroquine and so you would only be able by looking at LC 3 1 & 2 in

[01:09:18] PBMCs in a person that was fasting you would only be able to infer autophagy flux because you wouldn't actually be able to measure it it's a clue a clue it wouldn't be proof but it would be one could presume I would expect you would see more conversion of 1 to 2 and then to going into the lysosome I don't think that would get you the answer that you need now what if we had a hundred volunteers who are willing to fast and subject to blood draws and muscle biopsies so you could use the muscle biopsies to actually quantify the flux and establish let's say you could do it a different time points so you had a hundred people fast for different periods of time 3 4 5 6 7 days etc you've got tissue and you've got blood what else could you look for so again could BHB be a proxy could glucose be a proxy I remember you once mentioning another organic molecule you had identified you knew it by how many carbons at had and you thought it was ringed but you weren't sure like what it was yet have you figured that out yes that was something that accumulated when we inhibited our tapa G and that was glucuronic acid so that would be I think you're going down the right Road so I think what we can do and we haven't really done this yet would be to look at metabolites because metabolism is so drastically changed so if we can't look at directly measure water fatrick flux in humans very easily because we don't yet have the proper tools we could use metabolites as surrogate markers for the consequences of autophagy that's exactly why I call it a signature as opposed to a biomarker because I think it's basically how do you use machine learning to take many metabolites there's a bunch of things we know are happening we just have to integrate them we know that leucine is going down we know Metheny will be almost unmeasurable we know what's gonna happen to glucose uric acid and then there's probably a whole bunch of other small molecules and things in the proteome that we don't need know that are probably discernible from PBMC directly or indirectly through other things in the plasma and it just seems like a problem that is so ripe for a machine learning environment where you don't need that many people because you know what the gold standard is you just starve them and then you have the check which is the muscle biopsy which can give you some sort of quantifiable gradation I mean do you get the sense that that's something an IRB would approve it's invasive you know it requires biopsies and fasting and things like that but or would they demand that you hey first you have to do this in mice that's what I would expect and so one of the things that we have been talking about is we've done some of this for probably not enough is to do a metabolic characterization of a wild-type mouse fasted versus an autopsy deficient Mouse fasted I think that would potentially identify the metabolic changes that were autopsy dependent and

[01:12:40] I think that would provide some clues as to what to look at in humans because the problem with looking at metabolism is you get an enormous amount of data and it's very very helpful to know what to look for we may have a list of things that are obvious to look for but right but the fine-tuning is gonna come in the non-obvious it's not gonna be a regression model based on five things we know it's gonna be much more complicated and I prefer not the under the lamppost science yeah taken unbiased view and gopher and honestly I get asked about this more than any other translational problem so the good news is I think there are a lot of people in the philanthropic community that would be interested in this even if this is not a question NIH is interested in

[01:13:27] I doubt NIH is interested in this problem although that strikes me as odd given how potent a tool fasting is and yet how we don't know how to dose it and I think it's worth pausing on that for a moment because that is such a stark statement if I'm correct I believe I am which is imagine we had the most amazing drug imaginable imagine we had a protease inhibitor for HIV and we knew deep down this could cure HIV the problem is we don't know how to dose it how long would we tolerate that ignorance imagine we had a drug that we knew could kill cancer but we just didn't know how much to give or how often to give it we wouldn't tolerate that for a minute and yet in fasting we have arguably the most potent tool and certainly if not the most potent probably one of the three most potent tools in which we can affect human health and we don't have a clue how to dose it or what frequency with which to use it and I find that ridiculous so I'm actually really confident that if there were a really great proposal put together that would go from the animal model to the human model it would be fundable it would be fully funded well through philanthropic efforts and so if nothing else comes of this discussion I would love to plant that seed with you and think about what would be the right consortium of people to do that work obviously there are lots of skill sets that we'd want to have involved in there but I really believe that could be funded quite easily and I think that the implication of that is as potent as anything else because again here I am doing my 3 day fast every month versus my seven-day every quarter versus 5-day every quarter like we just don't know and it really is troubling to me it just drives me insane well I think for the general community I think it's an important question even for practical reasons because you may you know be able to control your life to the extent that you can do all this at your own convenience but a lot of people don't have that flexibility and so if they can be told that fasting for X amount of time is all you need to do then the beneficial effects of fasting could be there would be more people that could take advantage of it absolutely and if you look at the work of someone like Valter Longo who his assertion is you can get most of the benefit without actually having to be fully fasted but to do something that is like a fast mimic where you reduce your calories significantly for a period of five days again maybe he's right but we have no idea we have no idea what the efficacy of that approach is versus a total water only fast for five days and it would be great to know because if we could demonstrate that you're getting 80% of the benefit doing a fast mimicking diet versus a complete fast well that opens the door to many more people who would be willing to do fast mimicry verses and outright fast and again I think about this constantly which is I'm almost willing to do anything I just want to know what to do so I think that now is the right time to ask that question let me just digress a little bit to talk about metabolism so we know a lot about metabolism essentially the field of not only just cancer metabolism but metabolism in general mapped out all the metabolic most of the metabolic pathways but what we lack the ability to do until fairly recently was to have a thorough understanding of metabolism and a living mammal and so Jafra bennewitz and i have invested a lot of effort in developing technology to use isotope tracers this would be c-13 labeled glucose and amino acids and so forth and to deliver them to living mice running around and doing normal mice things in a cage and then look to see how they're used and how different tissues use them and how there's nutrients sharing between tissues because when you're fasting there's many complicated things going on it's not just like there's no food and you're inducing otology and that's that's the only thing that's happening in a vacuum right so you have dedicated nutrients stores you have glycogen and your liver that's mobilized and that's a dumping glucose into the bloodstream you have laid out a post issue that starts degrading your triglycerides and then you end up with glycerol and fatty acids in the bloodstream which then you know are taken up by the liver and so forth so you have all these you know if you're really without nutrients for a long time then your muscle proteins start being degraded which is probably undesirable that's dumping amino acids into the circulation so that you can maintain your survival we have to understand all of that because it really occurs in different phases again if we just limit it to humans for a moment where we have a pretty good understanding of this what's happening in the first 24 hours versus the next 24 hours versus the next 24 hours is very different and George

[01:18:54] Cahill's famous fasting study the 40 day fast on the healthy subjects really divides it into these phases what's interesting is by about seven days into a prolonged fast you pretty much reach a steady state you've got a pretty consistent flux of triglyceride into free fatty acid out of the fat cell you reach a steady state level of beta hydroxy butyrate acetoacetate and glucose such that basically the sum total of them in millimolar concentrations is about preserved to where you would be non fasting like and so it begs the question if we posit that once you reach that steady state of seven to ten days you're clearly in a fully turned on at otha G state what's the switch look like when you're 24 hours or 48 hours or 72 hours into that are you 80% of the way to the benefit or just 20% that's a jugular question yes I think it would be fascinating to understand that and I think that if you look back over history almost all cultures have fasting as part of their history and I'm thinking that that is not by accident

[01:20:07] I think they must have learned by trial and error that this was a healthy thing to do and so I think that at Apogee I would expect as playing a major role in promoting health in response to fasting but I really think well maybe I'm sticking my neck out but I think using fasting as opposed to trying to find some pill you could take is something that's easy to do and of course it speaks to the irony of it which is if you took probably 1% of the budget that is being dispensed to find pills they stimulate at ah 50 we would actually be able to answer this question clearly absolutely and actually just have a dose for Johnson and look that doesn't mean these things can't coexist I'm all for it and I wanted to ask you of course about some of the other pills like rapamycin and metformin and the role that they might have and how we might be able to measure that but again this just strikes me as the most obvious question in the space of how to prevent disease and it's like you have this beautiful beautiful tool and you don't know what the dose is and you don't know what the frequency is if someone knows that they're susceptible to an urgent generate disease has anyone looked at those people to see if they engaged in some sort of fasting regimen whether that was helpful or not indirectly I mean it's possible that that's been done directly and I just am not familiar that

[01:21:38] I think what we've seen indirectly is dietary restriction as opposed to just pure caloric restriction where you improve the quality of macronutrients specifically around improving glycemic control you can take people that are in an early stage of cognitive impairment and delay it and or reverse it through that type of nutritional intervention now of course that doesn't necessarily say a tappa G is playing a role because that's doing a lot of other things it's improving glucose and insulin signaling in the brain it's doing a lot of other things and we were really starting to see the impact of metabolism in the brain so that's not entirely clear indirectly I would say there are

[01:22:19] I think some pretty interesting compelling pilot data that suggests that rapamycin is neuroprotective and again rapamycin a very potent inhibitor of mTOR would presumably on some level induce a toughie gee I think it's a very interesting question as to what is it about rapamycin that induces a longevity phenotype rapamycin to me is the most interesting molecule out there because it is I think the only molecule that has demonstrated a longevity benefit across all four models of eukaryotic cells so that's a really big deal that can't be ignored but how much of that benefit is through a toff adji i'd like to turn that question to you how much of it is through inhibition of senescence cells reduction of inflammation again so it's very indirect and it speaks to again again I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy theory guy because I'm not but it is a little frustrating that we have these amazing tools but because they're not particularly profitable you don't really have somebody that's interested in answering them and that's why I again come back to hey I think these are answerable questions B I don't think they are billion dollar questions I think they are really questions that are amenable to the philanthropic community and I think from an ROI perspective it's hard to think of examples of where you could put dollars to work in research that would have a greater impact on human life right and I think that our biomedical community is mostly focused on putting out fires rather than disease prevention although

[01:23:52] I've seen a change I mean I see at the NCI the National Cancer Institute a bigger interest in cancer prevention so I think people are coming around to realizing that making people healthier longer is probably more important than once they discovered to have Stage four pancreatic cancer what can we throw at it to make them live another two months yeah again it is sort of amazing to me how lopsided our resource allocation is with respect to that problem because you're absolutely right we have spent probably a core of a trillion dollars in the last 40 years on the second question which is once you have metastatic cancer how do you live longer and we've done an analysis on this so for the quarter of a trillion dollars that has been spent on that problem on average for solid organ tumors we have extended median survival by less than about a year since 1970 so almost 50 years that's pretty sad when you think about the fact that there's not much evidence we've reduced the arrival of cancer in fact all we've done is basically come up with a second leading cause of cancer in terms of modifiable behavior which is after smoking it becomes down to diabetes insulin resistance and all of the metabolic distress oh yeah I'll get off my soapbox now but again I this is in many ways just a sort of a plea for help which is I think there's interesting had amazing opportunity to understand this so there's another component to this that worries me greatly so what we see you know so a lot of this you're talking about controlling metabolism to preserve health through implementation of fasting and understanding fasting but look what's happened to the American diet I mean there are people now that don't even recognize vegetables in the supermarket there are people that only eat prepared food and so what we've seen is on the one hand you're talking about preserving health and all that but on the other hand the overall health of

[01:26:16] Americans is deteriorating obesity is greatly increased and has no sign of abating the diet of Americans loaded with high fructose corn syrup and diets that are disproportionate with prepared food so the only way to globally improve the health of Americans or anyone else for that matter is to deal with both of these problems at the same time and to me that's probably the greatest line of reasoning that says fasting is probably protective against all chronic disease because if you look at the three main chronic diseases that account for to our last analysis eighty two percent of deaths above the age of 50 in the United States excluding COPD so if you take out the obvious smoking related death of COPD eighty two percent of death is attributable to cardiovascular disease cancer

[01:27:15] Alzheimer's disease and complications of diabetes that's pretty stark there's no question that when you improve metabolic health which you can do through fasting you reduce the risk of all of those significantly of course the question becomes how much of a role does a toff adji play in that specifically you look at the example you gave of neuro degeneration that makes a very compelling case for it probably also in cancer what would we know about cardiovascular disease by the way nothing comes to mind I don't recall seeing anything in that area yeah I mean my take on the literature is that the benefits of fasting in cardiovascular disease are primarily mediated through the metabolic health benefits of it lower glucose lower insulin lower homocysteine and time lower inflammation primarily as opposed to something that directly pertains to a PO B or the inflammatory response to that but again maybe it's just there and I haven't seen it what else do you think is going on what travels with etaf Ajit can we talk about senescence for a moment do we understand a sense of what's happening when an animal or a human is undergoing a toff og with respect to either SAS or just the overall senescence cells yeah there seems to be complicated roles for

[01:28:38] Tavo G in senescence and was evidence from the Narita lab that SAS the secretion of inflammatory factors that occurs during senescence is facilitated by autophagy but then in the cancer setting you there's also examples where loss of autopsy limits and so I think in the senescence area it's still a little bit confusing and maybe a little bit context dependent as to what's happening and then going back to the question about molecules what do we know about metformin and Netaji do we know that in a fed state if we give an animal or a human metformin we can still induce 800g all things equal through just the AMPK activation yes now I think that that's true but I think that we don't understand over the long term what happens and what the consequence of having or tabaqui are not having otology is so for example we've never given metformin to our mice that don't have a tapa gee that might be an interesting thing to do what is the consequence of aw topper G induction by metformin it actually might be better to do that in a system where autophagy could be wasn't completely gone but could be toggled up do you have the ability to turn a toffee g into an analog versus a digital meaning where you can actually use gradations versus just on or off yes I think the mouse model where autophagy the expression of a Central Avenue gene is controlled by an SH RNA might be the way to do that experiment and then what about rapamycin what do we know about the use of rapamycin which has been studied so liberally across again everything from yeast flies worms mammals uniformly extends life potent inhibitor of mTOR which would signal a toff eg all things equal where do we see that relationship so there's been a lot of discussion about using rapamycin or

[01:30:53] Rapa logs as o tapu G stimulators but it's like what you said before it does many other things and it's also immune suppressive although that also depends on the dose right I mean the everolimus data suggested that it was actually immune enhance when given intermittently also have to remember that if you have a small molecule like rapamycin and you want to use it to preserve someone's health you have to make sure that it's safe and I think that's when everyone backs away because if you've got cancer and they want to try an experimental drug and you've got no other hope and you're gonna be dead in a short period of time there's a bit of latitude in what can be done clinically to test whether or not there's a small molecule or some sort of drug that will be safe and possibly have efficacy but when you're talking about prevention it's a big problem the drug companies are not interested in it because the amount of time it would take in the risk of right just a much narrower margin by the way that's exactly the reason we're in the situation we're in so just to reiterate we have a situation where I am not convinced that longevity as a game is going to be won on the back of extending the time you have a disease I have never seen a shred of evidence to suggest that that is the answer everything in humans and animals points to the opposite end of the spectrum longevity is about delaying the time it takes until disease comes the implication of that is prevention is the single most important tool in the longevity toolkit how do we reconcile that with what you just said all of our pharmacologic efforts the trillion dollars we spend on drug development is all on the wrong side of the equation it's on the how do you live longer once you have a disease and I understand why that's the case for all the reasons you just said and if that doesn't make the most compelling case for taking the best and safest drug of them all which is fasting and understanding how to dose it and what frequency to dose it I don't know what makes a better case along with exercise by the way I'd put the put exercise in that same category which is it bothers me that we don't really know how to dose exercise either

[01:33:21] I mean it's less of a problem I think because for most people the issue is do more but it would be really nice to know what the dose response is on different types of exercise especially for people who want to do the minimum effective amount so both from an exercise perspective and a nutrient deprivation perspective there's no more low-hanging fruit in terms of minimizing human suffering than understanding how these things work you should start a biotech company to do this David seventeen and I have talked about this at length and he has constantly told me to do this and the way we've thought about it it's not going to happen because I won't do it so someone else will have to do it the way David describes it very eloquently is right now metabolic response to nutrients is a black box and what David thinks and I think he's right is there's a multi-billion dollar opportunity in decoding the black box in other words when we understand exactly what the response is to each different type of nutrient in every different dose and frequency and we can decode that in the way that we can do with so many other biochemical processes you can do everything because then you could actually develop drugs probably they could actually do something so there's a drug development platform that comes out of that and then from my standpoint what

[01:34:38] I'm really interested in is is simply just on the front lines as a sort of knuckle-dragging doctor how do you even just put this into clinical practice but again it's as high risk it's a lot of effort to do part of that I think on the drug development side there's a lot there I don't think it's very high risk on the question I posed to you earlier I think the let's do the Mouse study and identify the 50 metabolites proteomic signature things that are generally going up with the tofu G and then let's shotgun that in an unbiased way against human subjects like I feel like that's a project in the tens of millions of dollars not even the hundreds of millions of dollars and again if you add one year of life to each human as a result of that that's kind of staggering right and I think if you couple understanding mechanisms of metabolic delay of damaging diseases with surveillance for risk factors I think those two things really need to be coupled together because you can even if you define what the optimal diet and exercise and fasting regimen is for delaying the onset of disease there are still unlucky people and I think that we can't forget about them in the context of health and longevity and well-being because you could have the healthiest diet and do everything right vogelstein has written about this right I mean there's clearly a component there's a stochastic component to this and yes oh absolutely and again I don't think there's any reason to believe that we couldn't be addressing both of these yes yeah I mean

[01:36:23] I think that there's no reason to do everything one always has to bear in mind that there is this other risk factor that no matter what happens with understanding metabolism and fasting and good health practices that other thing is still gonna be there if you have a bracket one mutation that's a compounding and separate issue so in 2016 the Nobel Prize was awarded for the basically the genetic elucidation of at hoffa G what are the salient features of that award what was it about Asami's work that led to that award so what Osumi did was quite profound and very creative he developed an assay well he asked what are the I mean yeast requires nitrogen for survival and he asked what are the genes that are required for nitrogen survival and he identified the autophagy essential autopsy genes and I always wondered whether if he was in the United

[01:37:26] States would work like that be funded because it just seems like it was an important question but it didn't have such a clear application down the line that's right it was a bit too high-risk to fund right and also the clear disease connection wasn't there and so forth and so on and nonetheless he did that and I guess the point is is that sometimes scientific discoveries are so basic that you can ever anticipate what it would ultimately lead to and in this case it led to something very extraordinary but he probably had no idea at the time and once they discovered these essential etapa genes in yeast then it was apparent that there were homologs and mammals and so forth and so on how conserved are those genes between yeast and mammals if you do a blast search you can see them I mean not all of them but the amino acid homology was compelling well so when you sort of think about the future of this I think so much of what we've talked about kind of feeds into what your optimism is but how do you want to spend the next ten years of your career what are the questions you want to probe I think I would like to translate what we've learned about the role of autophagy in cancer and that involves developing small molecule inhibitors to inhibit at

[01:39:00] Apogee for cancer therapy and Alec Kellerman and I started a company to do that and what we're focusing on now is defining at the molecular level but the functional requirements for toffee are in individual cancers and this involves understanding the metabolic role of Vltava gy1 cancer needs autopsy more than another and then the newest connection is the connection to information when you win activate at

[01:39:34] Apogee you stimulate inflammation and this is what we've talked about earlier in the context of cancer that could be a really good thing because the game-changer in cancer therapy now is the immune checkpoint blockade in fact what I was just talking about at the ACR meeting yesterday was the particular patient that came to our Cancer Center and went through surgery radiation chemotherapy and it all failed and her body was riddled with tumors and she went on a clinical trial for immune checkpoint blockade and her all the tumors melted away and that was five years ago and she's perfectly fine so what we have to do is make that work for everybody and if inhibiting law tapa G activates the immune response and can facilitate not people who wouldn't respond to immune check my pocket to respond then that would be critically important to do I mean let me think about that for a second so when we think about the patients that are responsive and we really have two big targets right ctla-4 and pv-1 melanoma obviously is a huge success story here because it is so mutagenic it's interesting I have a friend who has

[01:40:59] Lynch syndrome so that's a familial syndrome where people are predisposed to cancer he developed colon cancer when he was quite young went on to develop pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma the pancreas which is uniformly fatal almost without exception he presented with an advanced state so he was not even a surgical candidate so the tumor had completely engulfed his mesenteric artery and vein which meant he couldn't even undergo the surgical procedure though it wouldn't have done much anyway

[01:41:27] I had just read a paper six months earlier in the England Journal of Medicine about Africa but the paper was exactly about but it made me think that because he had Lynch syndrome and he has so many mutations he might be a candidate for a checkpoint inhibitor so we went back to his oncologist and said hey can we get him on kite Ruda they said which is an anti PD one they said no that's there's no standard for that but we found a clinical trial actually got him in he got kite Ruda that was five years ago he's disease-free so you go from unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma - no pancreatic cancer pretty remarkable now the question is when I think about how broadly extendable that's going to be it really comes down to how many shots on goal do you get how many mutations do you get such that you can activate these checkpoint inhibitors and so tell me how a toff adji fits into that because I think I'm missing the link of why enhanced immune nonspecific immune response would factor into that I know there's a link that I need you to explain it to me so that's exactly where we're going with research and should have been at the a or C ester so we know that tumors with a very high mutation burden respond better to immune checkpoint blockade but it's not that simple because there are patients with tumors that do have a high mutation burden that don't respond and we don't know why it could be they've up regulated some other checkpoint that we can't yet inhibit or it could be some other reason they don't Express class one or that the immune system can't see the tumor for some various reasons and then we also know there are tumors that have a low mutation burden that do this yeah and so a big part in fact we just got an NIH grant to study this is to make mouse models of cancer with low medium and high mutation burden with which to you could hang out at offer G and exactly we haven't done the autopsy part yet we're just doing the generating the models using proofreading mutations and polymerase epsilon and Delta to generate mice with cancer with various levels of mutation burden in their tumors and this is so cool because we'll be able to ask basic questions like how many mutations do you need when you have a low mutation burden what can you do to make the immune system see that tumor do you need only mutations in the nuclear genome what about mutations in the mitochondrial genome so one of the mouse models we made was to generate a mutator

[01:44:23] Phoenix in the mitochondrial genome there are human cancers that have a high level of mitochondrial genome mutations whether that has any effect on anything is completely unknown there's no reason why they couldn't be presented as tumor antigens and you'd think if anything they would be more immuno genic I mean they should be all things equal just because of their bacterial origin that should elicit a much greater immune response exactly right this is what this grant is designed to do to generate mutator phenotypes in mouse models of cancer so we can have a spectrum from low to really high mutations in the nuclear genome as well as the mitochondrial genome then to figure out the mechanism of response to immune checkpoint blockade to make cold tumors hot and that's essentially what the loss of Itachi is doing by promoting information it's taking a tumor that is not killed by T cells that does not respond to me in checkpoint arcade and rendering that tumor responsive and where do you put this on the hierarchy of optimism for the future of cancer therapy I mean to me the interesting stuff in cancer therapy is getting more and more targeted and stacking more and more therapies on top of each other so this is an elegant example of stacking something that is clearly going to become a pillar of oncology which is immune based therapy with something that frankly is partially metabolic and frankly partially more complicated than just metabolic therapy so you've got you almost add this to the layer of pieces of Swiss cheese you start to stack on top if you have enough of them you're not gonna be able to drop a pencil through the cancer doesn't survive that's right so one of the limitations that we have with immune checkpoint blockade is some of which I've already mentioned we can't identify who's gonna respond if who's not going to respond and we have to extend the responder pool but we have to be able to model that because it's very clear that a single agent is going to be a Munich point blockade therapy is not going to help moe the patients so how do we go about optimizing this treatment and having models where you can combine immune checkpoint blockade with other therapies to evaluate what is the optimal response is critical and that's what we're doing and whether fasting influences this it's completely unknown what's the role of etaf adji in the immune cell itself so either adaptive or innate I mean we may be both so we know that one of the things we did was to turn auto AG off in a mouse and ask how that affected basic immune responses and the answer was everything in the short term appeared to be completely functional and if anything the t-cells were more anti tumorigenic but if you go into the long term if you knock out an essential on top of the gene only in T cells for example and look nine months later I think those t-cells are not going to be very functional but it it really depends on how you design the experiment for a cancer therapy we want to know what happens acutely when you're inhibiting autophagy you're going to be looking at things in the short-term not in the long term so there's still a lot we need to do in that area but in the short term for cancer therapy the immune system seems to function well if not better in the presence of autop ægean addition this just doesn't stop getting confusing because again you would think that given the benefits of etaf adji and preventing cancer one of them you would think that that would only enhance innate immunity because of the role innate immunity plays in cancer screening which again I think just speaks to we are still really scratching the surface of all of the different tentacles that come out of these tools something like fasting seems very simple and it's simple of course to do but it has such a set of plea atrophic extensions and benefits that it's very unlikely that it's about all or none there's nothing black and white here it's really all these shades of gray that it's not intuitive when you look at them what the net effect is because it's a little bit of this a little bit of that more of this than that it's the balance of this versus that yes I would agree and I think context is important too when you think of all the big chronic diseases just based on what you've talked with us today about I think we have to be really excited about

[01:49:34] Alzheimer's disease based on the model you've shared I mean that strikes me as an amazing opportunity because one we don't have a single tool once somebody has Alzheimer's disease I'm sure you saw the most recent I don't know if you follow that literature but we just saw two enormous failures in the anti amyloid beta drug trials so we're back to kind of square one which is not a single drug that works for this condition if any disease demands prevention it has to be this one it's hard to make the case that fasting isn't going to play a beneficial role there isn't it I believe you have to be tested but I think that when you look at the dramatic failures in preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease you have to ask the question what is the root cause of that and if you look at the approaches all the approaches are designed to ameliorate a symptom and the research is not yet gotten to the root cause and I think that that is the reason for these spectacular failures is they're trying to treat a symptom of the disease rather than the cause of the disease and when you look at the genes that are involved in neuro degeneration in general so they fall into a bra array of different categories and so my thinking is that they're all doing different things but there's some common denominator that has yet to be identified and I think that until the root cause of disease is identified just finding means to ameliorate the symptoms is not going to be productive Eileen you know I could sit here and talk about this for hours and hours I want to be respectful of your time because I know you've stayed an extra day to have this discussion of me which I really appreciate is there anything else you want to talk about today either as it pertains to your work something you're excited about in the future or anything else that pertains to a toffee gene I mean I think that understanding in greater detail how otology impacts metabolism we've done some of that but I think there's way more to do we have the technical ability to examine metabolic flux in a mouse in vivo in normal and starvation conditions and in response to different diseases and we're only at the beginning of doing that and I think that that's something that we will continue to do and hope that we can identify new targets for anti-cancer therapy or signatures of metabolic problems and we will continue to do that but again I want to return to the immunotherapy I think in the field of cancer building on that huge gain we can't take our eyes off that ball those are both very interesting and of course the former it sounds like you really agree with David Sabatini which is there's an enormous opportunity to decode metabolism in a way that we should have done 20 years ago I think we lack the technology I mean I think that so maybe I could take a minute to explain what we do and that by using c-13 or n 15 labeled tracers you can put them into a mouse infuse a mouse with these tracers and by looking at where they go by mass spectrometry over a different time over different time points you can see metabolism and that was something that was never possible before what is it as we've been able to label these things forever what was it the mass spec didn't have the resolution before or what is it that why is it we couldn't do this 20 years ago I guess I think they could do it with radioactive material and they could do it somewhat with the technology they had way back when but I think that the technology now is far more sophisticated by using heavy isotopes you don't need radioactivity now there are more mouse models of disease you could even do this in humans so ralph

[01:54:04] DBR Adina's at UT Southwestern is infusing these isotope traces into humans with cancer and actually measuring the metabolism of human tumors Wow that's interesting I did an experiment once on myself with doubly labeled water which of course is a very simple version of doing that sort of thing to examine energy expenditure right afield they doing that

[01:54:28] Wow yeah but I think that in fact next week I'm supposed to go to a keystone tumor metabolism meeting where all the experts in this area will get together and talk about this in detail but this is a growing field it's very exciting and understanding metabolism in mammals at a level we've never seen before in various disease states is tremendous and then lastly is it safe to say that should there be a strong enough public demand and a philanthropic demand to go after that question we talked about earlier about sort of decoding the dose effective fasting is that the sort of thing you'd be interested in working on yes I was fascinated by what happened when mice didn't have etaf adji and they died when they were fasted and I am very much interested in fasting as a way to preserve health I'm also interested in is what I mentioned earlier the dietary because I think all of this has to go together it's not just how many calories you eat or how often you eat them it's what they are so yes that's something that's very important to me well I mean thank you very much this was super super interesting and I know that folks are gonna this'll probably pose a few more questions than even we had time to go into but it's great your work is fantastic and I appreciate you your generosity oh this has been a lot of fun
