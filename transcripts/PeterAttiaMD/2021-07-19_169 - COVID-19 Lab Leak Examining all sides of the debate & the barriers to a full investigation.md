## Description

Katherine Eban is an award-winning investigative journalist who previously appeared on The Drive to discuss the widespread fraud in the generic drug industry. In this episode, she discusses the content of her recent Vanity Fair article, which examined the evidence for the theory that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from a virus lab escape as opposed to a natural virus that came from an animal host. Katherine and Peter walk through the evidence for both theories as well as discuss the long and troubling history of dangerous lab leaks and safety concerns about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  They also talk about the controversy surrounding gain-of-function research and its funding by the US government. Finally, they conclude with a discussion on the likelihood of definitively establishing the origins of the virus given the Chinese government’s lack of cooperation and highlight the fact that the many barriers to performing a full investigation may be the most troubling aspect of the controversy. This episode was originally recorded on July 6, 2021.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey catherine great to uh great to have you back on the show here awesome to be with you again uh it seems we're always discussing something controversial so uh and by the way i already know what our third podcast will be about based on other controversial work you've done so um yeah you don't like to write about things that are simple no i don't seem to it is the fate of the investigative journalist um well let's start with a broad question which is what attracted you in particular to this story and why did you decide that you had something to offer especially in a story where um not to let too much out of the bag too soon but it seems that this is not something that can truly ever be known one way or the other so it seems a bit of a frustrating exercise yeah well i've been covering the pandemic for a year for vanity fair and you know as things have come a little bit more under control in the u.s at least for the time being uh my editor and i were like what are the big unanswered questions of the pandemic and we decided that the biggest uh is what its origin was um now you know one might say well that was settled a while ago or seemingly settled right it came from nature but we don't know exactly how or where um but it was interesting because the head of the world health organization himself said we still don't know you know and all hypotheses remain on the table so it seemed that with trump out of office with the w.h.o head himself raising this as a question uh it was a good time to begin to look into what was the sort of what's the debate what's the controversy what are the questions uh and what i uncovered was a lot more than i had really considered or bargained for when i started my reporting maybe for folks we should give a little bit of background on what a lab leak implies is there a precedent for such a thing in virology because at the surface it certainly sounds nefarious right it sounds like well that must be a deliberate thing and it immediately falls into the realm of conspiracy theories um but in fact there's quite a precedent for viruses getting out of labs in the modern era and i would define the modern era as the era of microbiology obviously there weren't lab leaks that accounted for the spanish flu um but are there any that that come to mind as you began your work here or that you had to learn about as a result of your investigation yeah so let me say first that lab leak um as it's understood is not a unitary theory uh it ranges all the way from uh you know field researchers went into a bat cave brought back natural samples into a laboratory and that natural sample somehow leaked or a laboratory researcher got infected simply through you know aerosol transmission which is what we're talking about this is not i mean the word leak implies like liquid gushing out of a pipe that's not what we're talking about we're talking about aerosol transmission but it could have been an infected lab worker it could have been an infected field researcher bringing a sample back but the you know phrase lab leak sort of runs all the way up to the possibility that someone in a laboratory was manipulating viruses potentially in an experiment to make them more infectious to see if they would become more infectious and that that new strain not a natural strain per se but one that was genetically modified could have leaked from a laboratory so it really runs the gamut it's not a single thing and yes you know lab leak um this is not like oh how could that ever happen in a way it's like how could it not happen because it's happened over and over and over again you know you had very serious lab leak in the soviet union which finally became exposed it was an anthrax leak you've had sars leaks you've had four sars lab escapes since the sars epidemic of 2002. um so this actually is something that happens a lot and and it seems that one of the uh most significant examples of this was this russian flu in 1977 which was uh an h1n1 flu that had been around in the 40s and 50s it was being studied in a lab it when it remember when it reemerged it seemed to target disproportionately people that were you know younger than 25 which at the time maybe didn't make sense although after it was clear that this was the same virus that was around sooner it made sense because obviously the people that were being afflicted were people that did not develop natural immunity um again there had been no to my knowledge of course because you wouldn't have had the tools to have done so there was no gain of function not that they could have genetically edited but i don't believe there was evidence that it had been sort of selectively bred or anything like that it was simply a question of this is a virus that's being studied in a lab and then somehow that led to it getting getting out and as you point out um at least four cases of the early sars one virus escaping and again when you read the stories of these which i've read at one point all of them it's it's these are mistakes that people can make it's you know these are perhaps viruses that are not being handled with as much care as they should be handled some shortcuts are being taken with respect to how they could be handled you know i think it's it's important to point out that people talk about you know bsl4 labs that are studying these incredibly dangerous pathogens and so those are the uh most protective uh highest containment labs where all the researchers are working in spacesuits with independent oxygen but the fact of the matter on the ground is that you have uh research with incredibly dangerous pathogens taking place in laboratories across the world that have much less protection like bsl 2 labs which are basically the safety standard of an american dentist's office um you know so so you've had live live sars viruses being studied in uh overcrowded laboratories you know in china and elsewhere um with very little protection very few protections so there's at least a precedent that a virus that's being studied can make its way out of the lab in fact there's there's a great precedent for it um but of course that alone doesn't explain what could have happened here it's probably worth also explaining for folks who haven't been so steeped in this story or at least reminding people of the typical way in which a virus can be transmitted between animal hosts and what it means to have an intermediary host and how for example those were identified in the cases of sars one and mers so you know it was presumed early on that like other past viruses sars kovi ii had a zoonotic origin meaning that it spread somehow from an animal and jumped to a human or that there was an intermediary animal so uh possibly a pangolin possibly a civet cat and that it went from a bat reservoir to some intermediary animal to humans so that is believed to be the case with sars kovi one that is believed to be the case with mers where there was a a dromedary as an intermediate host with the initial animal being presumed to be some sort of bat reservoir uh with ebola it's believed to have a zoonotic origin either a bat or a chimp it's not certain yet um but that is the you know that is the long history of these viruses that it has some kind of natural origin and then um evolves and mutates in such a way that it can infect a human and i think one of the questions here in the in the case of sars one it didn't take that long i believe it was you know in the order of about six months to identify its intermediary which is what's it called like a cavette like it's sort of like a little it's it's a little civic cat it's very is it a civic cat yeah yeah yes a very cute animal yeah and obviously in mers as you mentioned a camel what's relevant about this is that um that that they can that the virus can can acquire additional tools in that intermediary host before making that final leap and then so the question is how much of the transmission occurs between say the cat and the human or once that transmission occurs is most of the transmission occurring human to human and so as of as of now which is you know directionally call it a year and nine months post the first infection we don't yet have an identified intermediary host which implies that it exists but it hasn't yet been identified or there wasn't one and this might have traveled directly from bats to humans for which there's clearly a precedent based on what happened in 2012 right well let me just say that we don't yet have a designated animal host and it's not for lack of trying to find one so uh chinese authorities have tested up to 80 000 animal samples to see if they could find a host animal and have not been able to do so so there has been uh you know you could think of it as an international bat hunt to find the host animal of this virus and none has presented itself yet right so we have we haven't identified the potential bat source of it we haven't identified the intermediary of it um there is a close closest relative that has been identified correct yeah so i that is a sort of complicated question but there is a strain uh ratg3 which was found in an abandoned mine shaft in yunnan province in 2013 which is sort of the closest viral sample to the sars co v2 sequence so it's about uh 96.2 percent identical uh to two sars too and what what do we know about that um that i don't want to say accident but that experience in 2013 where the miners were exposed to it what do we know about their illness and and what does that tell us about uh that virus so there's a couple of really interesting things about um about what happened in 2012 first of all that it happened what happened but also how it came how it sort of broke into the public domain what happened um so just starting out in 2012 there were six miners who were given this very unpleasant assignment which was to go to this abandoned mine shaft and dig uh clean it out because it it was thick with bat guano which is bat feces essentially so they go in there and they dig for uh days and weeks and they become gravely ill so they become admitted to the hospital and the in kunming university hospitals they get admitted to the hospital the question is is it a fungus is it a virus they bring in an expert who analyzed this says it's a virus they have pneumonia it's a virus their symptoms were almost identical to covet 19 uh so he asked what were they doing they were digging up that guano what kind of bat it's this chinese rufus horseshoe bat which is the same one that um that triggered sars kovi one three of the miners die three ultimately recover so you know this is a case that should have triggered worldwide alarm because it looked like the beginning of an outbreak again but the chinese authorities never reported this to the world health organization it sort of remained below the radar except that this abandoned mine shaft became a destination for virologists in asia who were going into this mine shaft and getting samples and bringing it back to their laboratories probably the most active samplers from this mine shaft were were members of the wuhan institute of virology uh in wuhan they dug up many samples brought it back to their laboratories and they sequenced a sample which they called at the time four nine nine one and that was as we would find out later ninety six point two percent identical to sars co v2 except at the beginning of the outbreak nobody knew about this mine shaft nobody knew that three miners had died and no one knew about four nine nine one the only way that we ultimately found out about it is because a very curious uh unemployed science teacher in eastern india started digging into this database of chinese masters theses and pulled up an entire dissertation about this incident in the mine shaft now to be clear it would not have been known based on the infection of those six mine shaft workers and that with a basically a 50 mortality that there was any evidence that that virus could be transmitted human to human um correct it could have been simply that um you know they acquired it from the bats which is the most likely scenario in the presence of an overwhelming exposure to the virus uh but that the virus would not transmit human to human is would that have been that's right possible i mean that that's right we we we have no information that that they infected one another they were all exposed to this bat guano they went to the hospital doesn't appear that the hospital workers got sick so you know it's not doesn't appear that they spread it to other people but they were desperately ill and it's interesting to note the oldest miner died first he was the most gravely afflicted he was in his 60s um uh you know so if we look back at this incident in light of covet 19 you know there are a number of aspects of this that do look like sars cov2 in 2012. though clearly it's a different virus given that i mean i think for for a person listening maybe not familiar with genetic distance 96.2 sounds and like oh that's a perfect match but of course that's not remotely a match uh you know i've spoken with virologists who have said look to try to take a virus from 96.2 percent to a hundred percent um i mean would take forever i mean that would be a very long period of genetic manipulation so um the point being it seems unlikely at least if if that's true that that virus ultimately became sars cov2 did you uh what did your work uncover with respect to that specific concern right so the issue is that is one sample that was taken from that mine shaft but we don't know the whole universe of samples that came from that mine shaft now you know that sample was taken to the wuhan institute of virology which you know just to point out is about seven miles away from what was initially identified as the epicenter of the coven 19 outbreak in this hua nan seafood market but the issue is there were hundreds of samples that were taken to the wuhan institute of virology the database that housed these samples was taken offline weirdly a couple of months before the known start of the coven 19 outbreak so we're you know publicly we're not looking at the entire universe of samples that emerged from that mine now based on the fact that the wuhan institute of virology collaborated with a number of u.s institutions most notably presumably the university of north carolina which i think we'll get to can we look at any of the grants or publications that came out of those jointly and surmise just how many samples of coronaviruses were extracted from 2013 until 2019. yeah i mean well we know that there are hundreds hundreds of samples that were extracted and we presume that there was you know deep sequencing done on these samples but again we don't have access to all that information so you know we don't know if if any of those other samples may have closed the gap from 96.2 to 100 percent basically so again just to ground everybody in the thought process here if if there's an argument to be made that that sars cov2 originated in its final origination came from a lab you basically have a couple of mechanisms that that could have happened one would be that the exact version of sars co v2 was identified in the wild potentially in this mine was brought to the lab where it was being studied but not altered before it infected presumably a lab worker that ultimately led to the outbreak conversely a very very very close cousin to sars co v2 was identified in the in the wild again potentially in this mine where it was brought to the lab and research was done on it which we'll get to called gain of function research and that closed the genetic gap so to speak from where it started to where it currently is and what ultimately led to the the outbreak through presumably some contamination within the lab is that sort of a safe summation of the plausible scenarios that is and you know let me just add that the reason those scenarios exist as questions that remain unanswered is because there has been a fundamental lack of transparency that has essentially been enforced by the chinese government um and i mean there to distinguish between the motives of the scientists and the motives of the government we don't know whether the chinese scientists would like a full accounting of everything that happened and are being prevented uh at giving one because the government is restricting it so you know we really uh the questions can't be resolved because there hasn't been transparency around them so who would be the most um preeminent scientists or scientists in china with respect to viruses there's a there's a pretty interesting character who leads the charge there correct she even has her own nickname she does and you know it's it's one of these stories where as a journalist you feel like you can't even make this stuff up right xing li is the lead coronavirus researcher the foremost coronavirus researcher in china she is a sort of nationally revered very well-known figure so she is the lead coronavirus researcher at the wuhan institute of virology and she has this nickname batwoman and that comes from her fearless exploration of these bat caves in southern china so you know when you see her image she's often shown wearing this spacesuit in the bsl4 lab at the wuhan institute of virology uh and she's you know she's like among the sort of sparkling firmament of internationally renowned scientists she's nobody disputes that she's earned her place there and she's particularly well known for a key discovery from the sars kovi one outbreak which is she was the first researcher to figure out the mechanism by which humans were infected by that virus which is through the ace2 receptors human lung cells so she identified the mechanism for transmission now how long has the uh institute been doing gain a function research and maybe even before we answer that question we could take a moment to explain what gain of function is it's actually not perfectly um there isn't there isn't an exceptional definition for it but but i think we can loosely describe it sure so you know first of all um there are there are um some people who say that all of virology is gain of function research which is basically when you study a virus you are seeing sort of what functions it gains and what functions it loses you know how does it infect um is it going to become more infectious and by what mechanism is it going to become more infectious so gain of function research put simply is this idea that you are trying to test whether the pathogen can become more infectious you're trying to give it attributes that it doesn't possess in nature as a way to gauge its infectiousness to humans um yeah sorry go ahead no no i was just gonna say look at the surface i think if you're listening to this and you don't dabble in this world that sounds a bit absurd right we're going to take a virus that may have a certain level of either virulence or lethality or transmissibility you know some feature that makes a virus undesirable and we're going to enhance that so what's the argument for doing that what's the argument for making a bad virus worse or making a good virus bad so you know first of all let me say this is hugely controversial and has sort of divided the field of virology because there are people who say this is absolutely crazy you know as one source said to me it's like it's like looking for a gas leak with a lighted match and there are other people who say this is absolutely essential so the argument for why to do it is that in order to gauge the risk from viruses that exist in nature you have to experiment with how they become infectious to humans and one of the ways to do that is essentially to soup up that virus you know you can through genetic editing you can make it more infectious and see if it is you know one of these things that it's it's a determination of where we should put our resources you know what do we need to protect against um there are other people who say all right we're going to these very remote areas where these viruses are tucked inside these caves we're taking back samples to laboratories in crowded urban areas we are then altering these pathogens to make them more infectious right that is as one person said to me the definition of insanity is there any evidence that gain of function research has produced victories in the past and we can even just keep you know sars-ko v2 um off the off the list at the moment because i don't think there's any evidence it's benefited our fight against this virus but is there any evidence it has aided with the creation of flu vaccines or other vaccines right so so the people who defend it say that you actually do need to do this kind of research in order to help with vaccine development that this is the way that you figure out how to create resistance is to look at to experiment with how viruses might mutate so that for example if you wanted to you know kind of forecast what the variance of soros cov2 would be like as i'm sure the audience has heard of you know the fearsome delta variant which is so afflicting many countries in the world and now increasingly our own um part of you know part of what gain of function research can help do is forecast the mutations but you know there are people who say that there is a lot of other ways to do this kind of research without running the risk of unleash unleashing um you know deadly pathogens that you can't control once they're out in the world now what's the us government's position been on gain of function research yeah so this is uh you know when i started let me just say as a journalist um and as an investigative journalist i had been reporting on the pandemic for a year and once i got into this question that you just asked i was like wow i can't believe how controversial and yet how under the radar this whole question has been so um just to back up in 2011 a scientist named ron foshier did gain a function research with the h1n1 virus and um created uh a a um a pathogen that he said was the most dangerous and infectious the world has ever known uh through manipulations so that sparked this outcry in the scientific community a group called the cambridge working group was formed which was basically stood in opposition to this kind of research and their expressions of concern led the u.s government to impose a moratorium on any kind of funding of any kind of gain of function research of sars and mers pathogens so then began a period of review task forces reports analysis and interestingly in the very beginning of the trump administration in in january of 2017 that moratorium was lifted um but it was replaced with this framework which had pretty much enough you know loopholes to drive a truck through but it basically said any agency in the u.s government that wants to fund this kind of research needs to have its own review process in place and needs to ensure that the entities that are getting u.s taxpayer dollars are proceeding safely i know that one of the one of the things that has has allowed people to sort of lose faith in the government has been statements that both francis collins and anthony fauci have made with respect to this when asked both of them have been asked if the united states government or specifically nih has funded gain of function research both have emphatically denied it i i believe the direct quote from francis collins neither nih nor nia id have ever approved any grant that would have supported gain of function research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans also in may of 2021 anthony fauci told the senate hearing that nih and nia id categorically have not funded gain of function research to be conducted at the wuhan institute of virology can you evaluate the veracity of those statements so here is where we enter this true semantic marshland um because the the feeling of and i'm not talking about sort of wing nuts who want to fire fouchy credible people who have evaluated this say that there is some sort of rhetorical uh gray area here first of all while they haven't funded research while the government hasn't funded research at the wuhan institute of virology directly they have funded basically an intermediary nonprofit called ecohealth alliance which in turn has given subgrants to the wuhan institute of virology so yeah no direct funding but yeah indirect funding now part of the obligation of eco health alliance was to report back to the nih and say you know here's our progress reports here is you know what the wuhan institute of virology was doing with some of your grant money and we ensure that they've been doing this safely we don't know what's in those progress reports because nih has not released them that smells like a foa waiting to happen oh i'm the nih now is like being buried up to their eyeballs in foyas absolutely you know people want to know what did they know about this research um you know there there are numerous investigations ongoing into that very question right now including from the hhs inspector general so there there's a lot of questions around this and not you know and and let me just say um part of the reporting effort for me was um disentangling conspiracy theories and there's you know their wall-to-wall conspiracy theories out there um you know disentangling the ones that have no basis in reality and then trying to evaluate the credible questions right so in my investigation there are credible questions um you know about that funding i mean why were we giving taxpayer why were we allowing taxpayer dollars to you know a high-level chinese laboratory where we now believe there was actually military scientists working in there they're obviously an adversary as as one person said to me hey what what's wrong with the louis pasteur institute you know i mean maybe we should make more of an effort to restrict our research dollars to uh this the science laboratories of of allies and not adversaries tell me a little bit about eco health alliance why are they acting as an intermediary what's their mission what does this organization exist to do um so eco health alliance is a non-profit which is run by a fellow a zoologist named peter dashik and has a very laudable goal which is basically to sort of map the viruses in the natural world and use that information in part to preserve wild spaces right if we continue on the path of habitat destruction and we end up sort of you know cheek by jowl close to these uh viruses like ebola it's you know we're both extinguishing the natural world and endangering our own uh health and safety on this planet so that is the the goal of uh eco health alliance but the organization was pushing very very hard for big funding dollars uh not just to fund you know this research on a small scale but had their eyes on something called the global virum project which was basically a massive mapping of the world's viral strains and you know as one of my sources said then it's not just looking for a gas leak with a lighted match it's looking for a gas leak with a blow torch right if you going into all of these wild spaces and you're pulling back bringing back all of these dangerous viruses you know and potentially unleash the unleashing pathogens you know the scientific question here is do we need to know all the answers to this or can we just kind of leave the caves to themselves and you know make sure that we closely regulate all of this activity so fast forward to the trump administration in the middle of the covet outbreak trump gets asked at a news conference by a journalist from a right-wing media outlet called newsmax why why is the u.s government giving money to the wuhan institute of virology which was inaccurate but trump answered we know about that and we're going to shut it down about a week later um the nih is forced by the white house to sever or to stop the grant to eco health alliance you know so at that moment it looked very much like wow the trump administration is really interfering with the science this is critically important research in a time of covet 19 but as the story has evolved you know there are real questions about what was going on in the wuhan institute of virology what uh our taxpayer dollars was funding there um and because of the lack of transparency it's very hard to evaluate that so let's go back to sort of january 2020 when the virus was identified sequenced uh i i think it still looked somewhat contained uh at least contained to china they had shut down wuhan you mentioned that in september i believe of 2019 the database of all viruses extracted uh from the mine presumably the database would have contained all viruses that they had been working on as well that had been taken down that is right and we don't know why and it hasn't been put up since then so so so you know what was presumably this transparent uh hub of international science with xi jiang li doing these uh you know research experiments and collaborating with scientists around the world suddenly it was like the the you know steel doors in front of this this institute just were you know shut shut tight and and um nobody can see into what strains they had what i mean there was a lancet paper that came out in february of 2020 that very aggressively made the case that any suggestion that this didn't originate in nature was ridiculous um that was that a peer-reviewed paper was it was it an editorial what what was the nature of that paper was it an opinion piece yeah so you know it's important to note it was not a peer-reviewed paper it was a statement which was published by 27 scientists um who said basically anybody who is saying um that this could have had a lab origin is siding with is trafficking in conspiracy theories and we stand with our fellow scientists in china to say that this had a natural origin it was a big piece of branding right that suddenly raising the question of the lab leak um was aiding and abetting donald trump's xenophobic agenda aiding and abetting conspiracy theorists and as um one of my sources said it was like it was nailed to the church door it became the orthodoxy and it really shut down debate but there was something more consequential that emerged from that lancet statement the scientists who signed it asserted that they had no conflicts of interest the problem was the the person who had sort of designed and orchestrated the statement uh was peter dashik who is the president of eco health alliance a number of the scientists who also signed were either employees of him or had received grant money um and even though he's saying he they that he has no conflicts of interest he was providing money to the wuhan institute of virology so it was not a kind of neutral value-free assertion right um he has a stake in this he definitely has a stake in this um as as somebody pointed out you know if it turns out to have been a lab leak it could do to the field of virology what chernobyl did to the world of nuclear science research right transform the whole thing shutdowns restrictions moratoriums um so peter dashik as the recipient of million well not personally but eco health alliance as the recipient of millions of dollars in grant money definitely had you know a horse in this race besides nih who else would be funding this type of research would the dod be funding any of this research it has dod gave grants to eco health alliance um you know and and so as i spoke with investigators inside the u.s government who were looking at covet origins over the last year what they found is that there is a big they called it gain of function bureaucracy inside the federal government there are a lot of people who are invested in this kind of research who are giving grant money for this kind of research um so they you know they have committed to this kind of very aggressive viral research um and so they have you know an interest in the outcome of this question and as these investigators told me it had an enormous impact on their ability to just neutrally evaluate the question of origin this is more of a question of speculation but do you think that had all of this taken place in a world where it had not been politicized in other words if politicians including the president of the united states had never weighed in on this if this were a discussion that were only going to take place in the scientific community do you think the reaction would have been as polarizing it would have made a huge difference i mean partly this became so polarized because president trump at that point lacking a lot of evidence in april 2020 announced it was a lab leak um that he was certain it was a lab leak is there any evidence that he had intelligence to suggest that or was this simply an off-the-cuff statement right so according to my sources the most significant information that the u.s government obtained came in the fall of 2020 you know late summer fall of 2020. so april um of 2020 really predates a lot of the significant information that the government collected couple that with the fact that on the on the same day that he declared he was certain it was a lab leak hours earlier his own intelligence agencies put out a statement saying um we are certain that this was not genetically modified as it turns out they didn't particularly have evidence for that either but uh you know it's clear that elements of the us government were sort of ping-ponging off of these xenophobic declarations that president trump was making you know not necessarily as a good faith effort to get to the bottom of it but more as a way to bludgeon china you know and and as you know he he labeled the coven 19 kung flu uh he made a lot of very sort of negative assertions um and and it had this tremendous effect it created as one source told me an antibody response within the federal government uh to the idea that it was a lab leak was there censoring um for these ideas or questions on social media i wasn't particularly paying attention in the spring of 2020 to this but um was this the type of thing that if you had posted something about this on facebook where is it going to be taken down i mean what was the what was the level of um curiosity around this and and how much was was being explored well it's interesting because you know some some social media sites i believe including facebook were labeling posts like this as conspiracy theories uh and there has been some reversal since then you know also in the media where you have now um sites like vox that were you know posting disclaimers about conspiracy theories are now lifting those statements as the idea of a lab leak has gained in some credibility so let's um let's march through the government a little bit more here in terms of um the the efforts that were made to sort of try to get to the bottom of this because really everything we're talking about is is not really front and center right i mean front and center is containing this virus vaccine development uh i mean there are real crises going on here and presumably one could argue we'll look at this point and by this point i mean say in the spring and early summer of 2020 it doesn't as much matter what the origin of this virus is as you know what our response is going to be and obviously a year over a year ago um there was there was great uncertainty about that um is the window missed even by that point you know do we have evidence that things are that records were destroyed were attempts made uh to go and do site visits collect antibodies because to me it seems like the most interesting thing you'd want to do is gather serum samples and understand the the serial positivity of people within that vicinity and try to get a signature that way any efforts made by the who or others to do that or this or the cdc in china right well you know this is very interesting because i interviewed dr robert redfield for this story and he was he was the cdc head in the ui he was the ute head of the uscdc you know he said to me that from minute one of of his learning of this virus he began thinking about the wuhan institute of virology because he knew of this risky gain of function research they were doing and wanted to rule uh them out as a potential source he offered to send in a team of experts to do exactly what you're saying you know to do this widespread testing to do antibody testing of all the researchers there uh as he said to me you know i could have you know had we sent in a team of experts i would have been able to rule yeah i could have presumably if if the laboratory was not a source i could have ruled it out in a couple of weeks uh but china um you know whether they were covering up a lab leak or because they were just reacting the way an authoritarian government does uh they immediately circled the wagons they refused to let in a team of experts um and they did just start destroying records you know that is absolutely part of what they did so um you know there is no question that we have lost massive ground in the um in our ability to understand the origin and has the chinese government allowed anyone to go back to the caves in yukon where the original samples were identified where rit g13 was found to continue bioprospecting yeah i mean not only have they not allowed it they have actively arrested journalists who have tried to go there um the bbc sent a team of journalists there in december of 2020 they were tailed by chinese police they found a big truck blocking access to the mine shaft the wall street journal sent a reporter in on a bicycle and he was detained by chinese police in question for about five hours um you know his notes were confiscated so uh the chinese government has been blocking access to this mine shaft so let's talk about some of the lines of evidence both for and against this i mean i think what's what's clear here is one there's a precedent for this happening right so it's it's it's an absolutely plausible scenario two unfortunately because of the nature of the chinese government's behavior and by extension the u.s government's behavior there's ample reason to believe in a conspiracy but by no means is that necessary in other words right this virus could have completely occurred in nature and the chinese government would probably still behave the exact way it did and the us government would have behaved exactly the same way it did so you know unfortunately those things don't really i think move the thinking or the evidence one way or the other more than the other um but now let's talk about some of the features of the virus because i think this is where um it gets very i mean not that not that not that what we've said hasn't gotten interesting but but the biology of this is also quite interesting right yeah so um you know there has been a lot of let me first say that i don't think there there is no information that is in the public domain either regarding uh the viral sequence and the sort of oddities of the viral sequence um you know or regarding other circumstantial evidence that can answer this question one way or another you know you when i started reporting this there was you know there were plenty of articles that were like well maybe this and maybe that you know but the information that is in the public domain doesn't get you there um [Music] some attention or a lot of attention has been focused on what is called a furin cleavage site in the sequence um and that is you know part of the strain that one virologist told me is a sort of signature of genetic editing of the wuhan institute of virology that in a number of the strains they've worked on and manipulated and published papers about you see the insertion of a furon cleavage site in the uh in the viral sequence um and that is the spot on the sequence that makes it more infectious to humans so nick wade who's a former new york times uh reporter you know he published a long piece sort of analyzing the question of the science and the lab leak and he quoted you know this incredibly famous scientist david baltimore saying as soon as he heard about the furin cleavage site uh that was he told his wife that was the smoking gun you know and then he knew it was genetically edited since nick wade's piece came out and got a lot of attention david baltimore sort of walked that back and said well not really and then other people have come out and said well you find furan cleavage sites and sequences in nature and it doesn't necessarily have to be reflective of genetic editing um that's that's been my find as well i mean i i've spent far more time on this than i wanted to because it's one of those everybody does yeah it's one of those things you you sort of think well look i'm gonna just read these three articles and then but then you have to read every single reference to those articles and i mean i truthfully i i'm i'm i'm going out of my mind at this point and i i i don't want to read any more on this because it's it's too much but you know that's one of the rabbit holes i went incredibly far down and there's just outright contradictory information there now i haven't spoken to nicholas wade but in his piece he says there is no evidence of furin cleavage sites in any beta coronaviruses that are sars-like and yet right i actually found several references for papers that contradict that including a paper published in 2018 that found a furon cleavage site in mers which is a sars-like beta corona virus so to me the the presence of the furan cleavage site uh which to your point makes this much more infectious than sars one you had commented that uh that sars one you know it's it transmits through the ace um the ace2 receptor uh well this is on the order of like an order of magnitude more transmissible because that s1 s2 subunit is cleaved and now it has an enormous affinity for that h2 receptor so a more interesting question to me is the nature of the codons that exist there so the furin cleavage site is always a or not actually i believe it is i believe it is exclusively a proline arginine arginine alanine sequence and not to bore people with too much biochemistry but you have three nucleotides that make up each codon so you have redundancy in the system because there's only 20 amino acids but you have 64 combinations with all of the nucleotides you have more than one way to get an amino acid so what i think also got a lot of attention in nick wade's piece was the i think it's a cgg arginine and that is a very unusual arginine it's only typically present in five percent of chronoviruses meaning only five percent of the time when a when a coronavirus needs to make an arginine does it use a i think it's ccg or cgg okay but when you go and look more deeply in the literature it turns out that you saw that in other furan cleavage sites of other coronaviruses that also had very little of that in other words there was another criminal virus that i saw that only had three percent of its arginines being either ccg or cgg but it still showed up in its fear and cleavage site and there's no ambiguity about whether that was naturally occurring or not so does that mean it occurred in nature does that mean it was manipulated in a lab it's still very hard to know so i don't think really in any dimension of this there is no smoking gun per se what there is is smoke coming out of a lot of windows you know that's what i saw as i was reporting there is there is enough smoke coming out of enough windows that we cannot take the lav leak hypothesis off the table and so for me the most credible people on this they're not saying it was a lab leak what they're saying is why can't we have a full investigation that's what we don't have we have not had a forensic investigation and so if we haven't had a forensic investigation why are the scientists acting so unscientific by saying it wasn't a lab leak how do they know they don't actually know like just like we don't know we don't know that it was or it wasn't um you know but there's enough of a suspicious uh fact pattern uh that it requires investigation yeah i i of all the things that i have read and i i think at this point i don't know what i haven't read i feel like it's just so overwhelming i think the most compelling well welcome to the club yes i think the most compelling mechanistic answer so there's lots of circumstantial reasons right the occam's razor says you know in the middle of fall slash winter so in q4 of 2019 when there are no bats they're all hibernating you have a breakout in a major population center that's doing research on it you know so all of those things aside from a purely biological mechanistic standpoint i think the most convincing piece of evidence for a lab leak is that for about a year post this virus being in humans it didn't change we're only now seeing variants of this virus right like the delta variant you mentioned earlier that strikes me as interesting given that given the ubiquity of this virus so how many people were infected suggesting just how stable this thing was by the time it got into humans meaning a lot of the tinkering got taken out of it sooner now so so one argument would be if this were a virus that got manipulated and naturally selected through humanized mice which is to say mice that have ace2 receptors in their lungs which are the exact mice you would use to do this type of research in fact the mice which we know were being used for this type of research yes it that makes sense to me that you know you could easily have a virus that has now reached its state of maturation it gets out now into you know the wild um and it takes quite a while to evolve into its its new variant um what about you like where does that stack up in terms of biological reasoning uh in favor of a lab leak versus not so you know there one scientist alina chan uh she's a team right yeah she's at the broad institute and she has really advanced that idea and had a pre-print paper to that effect which is the idea that this virus seemed immediately ready to infect humans and didn't appear to undergo the sort of all the early mutations that you saw in sars cov1 right so it seemed sort of primed for human transmission which in her view argued for a lab leak but then you have scientists on the other side of that who say actually if you look at this strain this this is not maximized for human infectivity if you were going to set out to create this in a laboratory to maximize human infectivity this isn't it so i think those are again two competing uh versions of this but they're saying very different things like i don't think that at least is it elisa chen is her name i don't think her argument is that it's maximized in its potential i think if i'm understanding her argument correctly it's that it's reached a steady state it's in an equilibrium and i think that's a very different argument to the one that's being um posed in the other direction which is that oh well if you were going to make this you could you could make a much better job i think that maybe gives a little too much credit to scientists like you know it's sort of like saying well you know when those bombs dropped on hiroshima i mean they were good but they weren't as good as they could have been i mean come on they could have been way more lethal no no i mean like you know i have to say it is sort of a red-hairing argument because okay so let's say it's not like the perfect bio weapon to infect all of humanity overnight that wasn't its intended purpose right the credible people who talk about a lab leak are not necessarily saying it was a bio weapon it could be the accident of a sloppy you know a moment of a la momentary lapse yeah so again i've always found that argument to be completely nonsensical um because one it's if we believe in the broad idea of gain of function research it's not bioweaponry two even if you say well no but if you're going to go to the trouble of doing gain of function research you should try to make the most virulent deadly strain imaginable okay but are you going to make that in the first you know let's assume it takes a hundred steps to make that and what happened if we were at step 60 when this leak occurred right does that mean we weren't on a path to making it better so so again to me that argument is meaningless actually right there is a there's a lot there are a lot of red herrings in this debate so given all this sort of loose smoke that's sort of diffusing from the ground out of windows here and there how would you think about trying to synthesize the arguments that most favor the consensus view that this virus occurred naturally versus the contrarian view for lack of a better word that this virus emerged from a lab what would you say are the most compelling features that favor the former first let me just say that i actually don't think there is a consensus view at this time i think the consensus has been shattered and the scientific community is really divided um that said i think you know the strongest argument for a zoonotic origin is the precedent of previous uh of previous sars outbreaks you know cyrus cov1 and mers and you look at those and yeah those are sars outbreaks that have a zoonotic origin uh that has been identified right so it would make perfect sense that this would this is the big one you know this has come on the heels of those outbreaks um uh you know and you add into that you don't have any specific smoking gun uh evidence to contradict that right even though a host animal has not been found any intermediate animal has not been found um so i think those you know that in and of itself is sort of the most basic the most basic argument for it and to build on that really um you know sars one traveled something like 900 to 1000 miles from its original site using two intermediary hosts so to your point the argument that well if this originated in a bat in a cave a thousand miles away there's no way it could make it to this populated area no that that's that's not true it certainly happened in the past right um it certainly has happened in the past but let me just say that is one of the that is added to the mystery here because um you know what people are saying is well if it started in southern china in yunnan province why don't we see a trail of infections up to wuhan we don't so it looks like wuhan in central china is the origin of this outbreak why right so the original theory was uh there is a a host animal and it could have been a sample at the seafood market in wuhan but no you know all of this testing has not turned that up so you know in order to account for a natural origin you have to find a way to argue how uh in the dead of winter in central china um you know in a market that didn't sell bats didn't have bats uh at a time when most bats are hibernating you know how do you have how do you have this outbreak you know and then you look at you know the chinese scientists themselves were like oh we know where it came from it came from these labs two chinese scientists very early on in the outbreak posted a pre-print paper saying well we surveyed the area around the seafood market and uh there are these two laboratories that have all these bat samples so we think it came from them um and that pre-print paper was immediately taken down but you know you have this problem of how to account for how it started in wuhan now again to go back to evidence in favor of the zoonotic origin it could be because i don't think anybody disputes that the bats weren't transmitting it to people in the fall or winter i think everybody agrees that by the time september october november rolled around the bats themselves would have been in hibernation so the probability that a bat directly transmitted it to a human in say november december exceedingly low of course the bats could have passed it on to intermediaries before then and or the bats could have transmitted it on to a person or persons before then who didn't really become that ill but somehow managed to make their way to wuhan correct yes although there is a wild card in this which is the that the virus in many cases is asymptomatic so there are people who are arguing for an even earlier origin than we knew such as the summer of 2019 right there like dr redfield is one of those people who has said that he thinks the origin is actually a lot earlier uh and that it's very hard to pinpoint a date because of the problem of asymptomatic transmission right and you know you got to take a step back and remember what it was like circa may of 2020 when the very first papers were coming out looking at zero positivity suggesting that the case fatality rate was you know infinitely lower than it had been previously identified so you know when we were first thinking about this as oh my gosh like two percent of people or eight percent of people who are getting this are dying and it's you know the realization was no it's you know eight percent of people who are wildly symptomatic are dying or right and the more we began to test people the more that number began to fall but it wasn't until serology was being done on asymptomatic people this was done in santa clara a very controversial study by john ionides it was done in new york you you basically began to see look this has got a lethality of about one in a thousand people infected so if you then extract you know that back to china there's a scenario in which 500 people are infected none of whom really gets sick or think anything of it beyond you know it's just a it's a regular cold um but you know someone threads that needle of getting up to wuhon so that there's at least a plausibility of bat to human to wuhan in that time frame correct correct that is right yes if that were the case it's would still be interesting to identify the bat of origin but it sounds like that's not happening yet so let's chalk that up to first on our our wish list right so if we were creating a wish list of how one would get to the bottom of this it would be a full court press to identify uh you know to do basically an amazing prospecting exercise to look for uh the bat host potentially but but but just to say that in a way has been done right that's potentially what's in the database that was taken out in 2009 in september of 2019 but even since you know since the covet outbreak and and so that is post-dating what was in the database uh there has been a huge hunt uh and widespread testing of wildlife samples i mean there has been a big big hunt for the host animal uh which has not been found and has that hunt been carried out mostly by chinese scientists or has been a worldwide effort it's been a worldwide effort but you know the chinese authorities have tested i mean the the count and and the uh who report talks about this something like 80 000 animal samples have been tested in search of a point of origin uh and has not been found okay so then on the heels of that another scenario is that a bat infected an intermediary which either infected humans or another intermediary which ultimately infected humans several of those animals have been proposed and several of those animals could have existed at the wuhan market in the winter still alive not necessarily kept in the most sanitary conditions [Music] that seems like a very viable scenario and the biggest challenge to that is that very few stones have been left unturned in the search for what those animals might be and yet that has turned up empty-handed that's exactly right that's right so you know that is a very logical scenario except that there's no evidence for it that's the problem other than precedent correct yeah so i just want to make sure i'm not missing a scenario is there any other scenario that involves this virus infecting people having not been to a lab first um you know one thing that has been talked about is the people who live around these bat caves who have had exposure who have tested you know positive and larger numbers previously for sars antibodies um you know but you still have the same problem of if that is the or if that is a possible origin is a natural escape in location in southern china to villagers who live around those mines how does it get up to wuhan without leaving a trail of infection that could be documented right that's the that's the problem right so then on the other side we have a scenario where researchers are identifying this virus by identifying its original host and themselves get infected through that bring the bats uh or the virus itself into the lab and early in their tenure with these animals or with the virus rather there's a contamination i mean i really think of these as two two sides of the same coin which is gain a function versus no gain of function research but nevertheless the let the the virus has been brought into the lab i mean that's basically the other side of this coin um that's right the most compelling argument for that appears to be at least to my reading the contrapositive of what we just said i.e it's the absence of either the original bat or the intermediary host coupled with the argument uh made earlier about the relative lack of genetic uh drift or mutation once the virus took hold in 2019 in late 2019 the stability of the virus basically you know i think here first of all there is there is a lot of precedent for a lab leak as we've seen i mean there is a long there is a long history of this there is a proximity argument which is um why wuhan well here are these laboratories that have the largest collection of bat samples really in the world um who were doing some of the most aggressive testing so you know there's that smoke coming out of that window we know that they were doing um aggressive gain of function research in which they were manipulating pathogens and we also know that they were doing it not just in a bsl4 setting but in a bsl ii setting um you know and then you do have the um uh alina chan argument uh that you know you do not see the sort of wide range of mutations in initially in transmission that you did with sars kovi one so i think there's those arguments yeah and i i guess um you could almost break this down into two arguments which is what's the likelihood that this virus was brought into or created in a lab versus what's the likelihood it escaped the second problem so you you could break this down into two probabilities probability that this virus was brought into a lab and then really a third one probability that this was manipulated in a lab and then probability that this thing escaped or could have escaped well so if that's p1 p2 p3 p3 is like close to one that is that could be taken as a foregone conclusion meaning the probability that a virus in a lab can get out is very high but yeah we know about the bad ones that have happened but what we don't know is how many times has you know research been done on a virus in a lab that is of totally no consequence to humans and it gets out i mean we wouldn't know about it but that could happen all the time so if you're you know supposed to be functioning at bsl4 and by the way i mean i'm not saying this to sort of pick on the people doing it bsl4 is a miserable environment like you couldn't pay me enough to be a viral researcher working in a bsl4 environment i can i would rather be painting roofs with tar in july than i would be working in a bsl4 lab right it's yeah so so can totally understand why there's a natural human inclination to to take shortcuts with procedure there um so so i almost think of like that third step of could this have escaped the lab as of course it could have so it's really just a question of what's the likelihood that this thing made its way into a lab and got tweaked and that's where you get into these other questions of boy the people who claim it didn't aren't doing themselves any favors in the way they're acting uh you know the eco health alliance the the the lancet paper doesn't doesn't look good in that in the light of in the light of day no it does not look good um uh you know which is back to uh you know one of the groups that i talk about in my vanity fair article is this group that calls themselves drastic which are these scientists who are independent researchers scattered around the globe who became you know curious about this obsessed by this wanted to get to the bottom of it but you know and i interviewed a number of them how many of them are anonymous versus identified by the way there's a handful who are anonymous and i did not write about any of those who were anonymous who i didn't speak with um because you really cannot assess the agenda of someone who is anonymous and you're not interviewing i mean you don't know whether it's you know steve bannon hiding behind a a pseudonym so uh but you know for example the indian researcher who calls himself the seeker on twitter uh he's a science teacher in eastern india who was the one who uncovered this chinese masters thesis uh i was able to interview him um you know a lot of those people i interviewed they said the same thing to me i got into this because i wanted to know why the scientists were asking acting so unscientific you know why do you take a hypothesis off the table without evidence right if you're having an investigation don't you pursue all hypotheses in an equal fashion until you have real evidence and in fact you know the uh world health organization uh partnered with a group of experts who went to china and were basically sort of led on this you know highly restricted tour uh by the chinese authorities and issued a report in which they said oh the lab leak hypothesis is highly unlikely i obtained a u.s government analysis of that report which said you know the report is essentially ridiculous it concludes that on the basis of uh no evidence and in fact one of the lead researchers on that expedition was peter dashikovico health alliance so um you know there has not been wasn't peter dashik the only american brought in wasn't he the only american scientist brought in yes he was so there has not been a neutral conflict-free forensic evaluation of all possibilities of origin at this time do you have confidence that such a thing will happen um the biden administration recently requested uh such a report to be delivered within less than 90 days if i'm not mistaken yeah um it is going to take a huge act of political will uh and really you uh unity uh by many many different countries to essentially force the chinese to be more transparent um it's not necessarily a fight that the biden administration wants to have it's really inconvenient um i think it would be a whole lot easier to say well it must be zoonotic and we can't find the animal host bummer um so i you know i don't know if we're going to be able to surmount all of the political hurdles and the evidentiary hurdles uh that lay in our way to have have a real investigation into this and what would be required of full transparency what would what would be um what would be asked for that would demonstrate conclusively one way or the other well you know part of that is what probably will never happen china says you know what we're changing our minds full transparency we're putting back the database here's a record of all the samples here are the lab notebooks come do a tour here's the medical records of all the researchers who are in the laboratory um that is very very unlikely to happen we by the way have no serology on the three people who worked in the lab who got sick in the late summer early fall of 2019 correct my understanding is that we don't or if we do if our intelligence agencies it's not more definitive it's definitely not in the public domain so you know plan b assuming that china is not going to be more forthcoming is for the countries of the world to basically look in their own research files you know that there is a lot of information that is potentially available to us if we are really to dig into our own filing cabinets that is essentially what joe biden has called for he's told the intelligence agencies to go back to the drawing board inventory what they have and see if they can't come to some sort of closer conclusion you know there was recently uh an important paper put forth by jesse bloom who is an esteemed virologist who said that there were sequences that were in an nih database that were taken offline at the request of chinese scientists that had some early sequences from uh from wuhan so potentially you know there is information that our own government for whatever reason has either buried or ignored or removed uh which can be analyzed so given all the time you've spent on this so far how has your own probability shifted from zoonotic versus lab origin over the past year right uh well you know starting out when anybody mentioned the possibility of a lab leak my i was very dismissive because it sounded to me just like conspiracy theories and there were a lot of conspiracy theories um associated with that but i think what's happened is as time has gone on and no host animal has been found and trump has been removed and so there's a sort of space to ask this question without necessarily aiding a what's viewed as a racist agenda you know and china has failed to be transparent and conflicts of interest have been exposed you know and from my own reporting now i understand that a full investigation within the u.s government was essentially blocked or restricted you know i kind of give it even odds at this point i i i think it's a possibility i don't have a definite conclusion um you know if a host animal was found tomorrow i would be like okay um but i i think there are just too many questions to be ignored right now you know one of the things about conspiracy theories is they require cover-ups you know they uh you know one of the one of the conspiracy theories that's always obsessed me is the kennedy assassination ever since i was a kid um and i don't know probably by the time i was in my mid-30s i'd seen enough red enough that i concluded there's simply no way it was anything other than lee harvey oswald like i i really just decided despite what oliver stone would have you believe lee harvey oswald acted alone um and there are many reasons i could bore you with that include a more accurate looking at you know more accurate look at the forensics of of the you know the the ballistics and things like that but a big part of it is how hard would it be to keep everybody quiet if this were some cia plot or some mob plot or you know one of the other crazy ideas that's put forth and i guess that's one of the things that kind of nags at me here a little bit with this one which is if this in fact came from a lab how many people have to know that right it's not the case by the way that that peter dashing would never necessarily know that right he wouldn't necessarily know that i mean he might have a huge incentive to hope that it's not happened but he wouldn't necessarily know that but but presumably more than one person would be covering this up right and i guess that speaks to the bigger that number of people the harder this thing becomes over time if indeed that's the case so let me say a couple of things about this you know first of all uh the question of covet origin is the ultimate grassy knoll right you know this is one for the ages um i think the question of a cover-up you know it's very different to consider a cover-up in the u.s with a tradition of freedom of speech and protection of whistleblowers and to consider a cover-up in china with an authoritarian government that has control over everybody's lives and can act absolutely wreak havoc not just on a whistleblower but on a whistleblower's family so for example the the anthrax lab leak in the soviet union in the 70s only became disclosed after the fall of the soviet union right once this sort of authoritarian structure around it crumbled then it could be disclosed but you know china has incredible control over its citizens um and could even if let's say xi jiang li thinks it was a lab leak or knows it was a lab leak is she free to say that well certainly not well in china and not while her family's right yeah so you know that said i'm always mindful of this expression we have in uh investigative journalism never assume conspiracy when incompetence is an option um in other words you know it's easy to say conspiracy uh but but that's always a more unlikely possibility yeah conspiracy doesn't make a lot of sense here and i think it detracts from an honest look at the facts it should really be viewed as two competing hypotheses and one of them that got largely ignored because because it was politically inconvenient to consider yes that's that's right that's i side with that analysis 100 um are you optimistic that a year from now we're going to have much more insight because the reality of it is if you're if you look at what we know today versus what we knew six months ago virtually nothing new right very little new information there's just been more attention paid to old information which is always concerning when you're trying to think about this right because you know it's more interesting if oh my goodness there is more information that is emerging here we are learning more but that's not really the case we're learning more on the basis of old information and at some point we're going to saturate our knowledge based on that are you optimistic that we're going to learn more in the next year or is this going to become simply more of a polarizing discussion um well i have no doubt that it will be a polarizing discussion and continue to be one i think the real question the way i see it is how much political capital does the biden administration want to spend on this uh the biden administration and the other powerful governments of the world um how far are they willing to push china to demand answers looks someone in china knows some answer presumably like they know it was or wasn't a lab leak or they can guess that um how far are the governments of the world prepared to go to push for an answer for this you know besides the united states who yeah who besides the united states which governments would have the most uh persuasion well you know a lot of this is going to be fought economically so for example originally the government of australia of scott morrison was pushing to have the question of a lab leak as part of the sort of one of the facets of the world health organization inquiry into this they wanted to make sure that that possibility got on the agenda china's retaliation was very swift and they were immediately blocked i believe it was import of australian goods into china so there is a lot of economic retaliation that can occur in the push for answers and as we've already kind of identified there's no scenario under which a lab leak occurred and the united states doesn't have blood on its hands as well through both direct contribution of funding and also collaboration from a research perspective correct i mean in other words if there's a lab leak you know i you can't just say well it's just the fault of the wuhan institute of virology because it's just bad luck that it occurred there the reality is this could have easily taken place at the university of north carolina or the university of galveston in texas where similar research goes on the bigger issue is this was in some ways a joint effort between the united states and china correct well let me just say there is one other laboratory that is right near the huanan seafood market which is the chinese centers for disease control and prevention which had moved right next to the seafood market shortly before the outbreak began they had a coronavirus researcher who was very gung-ho had collected a lot of viral samples so i guess in theory it is possible that this came from a laboratory that had nothing to do with us funding but i would say you know regardless i still take your point that uh the lab leaks scenario raises a lot of thorny questions for the national institutes of health for how scientific research is funded um you know it would be hell to pay in the field of virology if the effort to identify viruses ended up unleashing them yeah it's it's interesting to think how this will how how this will unfold over the coming decade the economic damage the loss of life etc do you get a sense of how this will impact gain of function research at least in the united states um it's interesting because this whole debate has spotlighted this kind of tucked away corner of scientific research that the public really didn't know anything about and so i certainly think that any agency now prepared to give a grant to this research is really going to think carefully about this you know going to think about who are they giving grants to who are the sub grantees downstream right uh you know what are the hazards the dangers of the kind of research they're doing so this really has been spotlighted and i think it will even you know without a definitive answer i think it will have an impact on this kind of research yeah it's certainly clear that gain of function research didn't help here even if this was of zoonotic origin it's not like gain of function did anything to uh to prevent it or more rapidly thwarted well let me just say this which is you know eco health alliance's whole argument for existence is if we partner with these far-flung laboratories and we go out to these remote bat caves and we find these samples and we bring it in and we do this research we are going to have a way to potentially prevent outbreaks uh okay we spent million you know u.s government spent millions of dollars on that argument what did we gain didn't prevent covet 19 right so where's the benefit what's the upside what you know um what's the argument for the continuation of this that's a question that has not been answered well i wish i had a stronger point of view on this but i think i'm in your camp catherine i'm i can talk myself into both of these scenarios and the only thing i find myself really hoping for is the open and honest evaluation of this which unfortunately requires getting new information and i think the majority of that information uh probably lies outside of our borders and therefore is going to be limited um right so i'm not sure if we're going to be any further along in a year but uh you know i i yeah sorry go ahead no no go ahead i was just going to say i do believe that eventually one day we will know is it going to be in our lifetime not sure about that well it's funny right at some point if no intermediary host and or species of origin is ever identified like is there some asymptote to that you know or tail where you say well gosh if it hasn't been found in like a hundred years it really doesn't exist or you you know in theory you would imagine even if this was all done through gain of function research you'd need to find something in nature that was 99.8 percent close to it and then you would say that that last 0.2 percent had to be done in the lab but then you could probably equally convince yourself that no that 0.2 that variation of 0.2 took place in the first few people that were never identified so again i i just i go back and forth and i talked myself in and out of this and um i'm i'm frustrated that this is something that should be knowable and is not known which is generally more frustrating to me that things that you know are unknown that maybe can't be knowable but for example i have no idea if there is life beyond earth but i'm not as frustrated by that because that seems a lot harder to know this seems like something that is knowable and i probably will never know it well let's put it this way um regardless of whether there is life beyond earth the answer to that didn't force you to stay inside for a year and not see friends and family you know so this one yet this one for all yes but this one for all of us and i'm really struck by this feels so personal of course because it is and so the re you know people are people are obsessed with this question and once you start looking into it as you've experienced and as i did reporting it you just go down this rabbit hole in which like night is day and day is night and and you cannot get to the bottom of it no matter how many rocks you turn over well catherine maybe the next time we get together we can talk about the consultants that unleashed uh torture upon uh the the us government and the cia and their efforts in iraq would that be would that be a great follow-up discussion sure i'll do that one i mean my goodness do you ever write about do you ever write about things that aren't upsetting do you ever write happy stories you can guess for my silence i have to really think about that yeah it's it's not a lot of unicorns and rainbows over here no but um you know i tend to gravitate towards the things that fascinate me and you're fascinated by the macabre you really don't like good things do you in my own life i do but i do you know i do set out to try to get to the bottom of things that do not have easy answers and and sometimes those are can be quite dark well catherine um if it wasn't bad enough to talk about generic drugs and the corruption that goes on there you put a bow on it this time and again i think the bow is less about whether or not this did or did not come from a lab but more about the fact that there is there has been and likely will be forever an enormous obstruction to get to the truth about it yes unfortunately that is absolutely true yep well thank you very much for
