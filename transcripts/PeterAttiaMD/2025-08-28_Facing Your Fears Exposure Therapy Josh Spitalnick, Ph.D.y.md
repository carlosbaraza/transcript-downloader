## AI Summary

Based on the provided transcript excerpt, I'll analyze the content focusing on the discussion about exposure therapy:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The episode features Dr. Josh Spitalnick discussing exposure therapy as a primary treatment for anxiety disorders, including PTSD, phobias, social anxiety, OCD, and health anxiety. He explains the four main types of exposure therapy and emphasizes how the field has evolved from simple habituation to a more sophisticated cognitive model incorporating inhibitory learning. The discussion provides detailed insights into how exposure therapy is implemented in clinical settings and its effectiveness in treating various anxiety disorders.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Four types of exposure therapy discussed:
  * In vivo exposure (real-life situations) [00:02:58]
  * Imaginal exposure (written narratives) [00:03:35]
  * Interoceptive exposure (physical symptom induction) [00:03:35]
  * Media augmented/virtual reality exposure [00:05:18]
- Shift from habituation model (1960s-70s) to cognitive model (1986) [00:07:18]
- Pioneering work by Michael Kack and Edna Foa at UPEN [00:07:18]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Exposure therapy should be conducted in a safe, ethical, and compassionate way [00:00:00]
- Treatment requires readiness for change [00:00:31]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- For severe OCD cases, medication might be necessary before exposure therapy [00:01:06]
- Exposure sessions should last 30-45 minutes multiple times per week [00:08:59]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"Anxiety is all about anticipating something and being colossally wrong." [00:07:18]

"Nothing we do in exposure therapy have they not already experienced." [00:05:18]

5. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the success rates for different types of exposure therapy?
2. How does medication interact with exposure therapy treatment?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] You're not going to come to my clinic and be seen by an anxiety specialist, no matter what their degree, credential, years of service are, and not get some version of exposure therapy. And all exposure therapy is is an intervention that helps someone approximate their fear, facing it head-on in a safe, ethical, compassionate way without putting them in any ethical, legal, or medical risk. Some people might think it puts them at risk, and some people might think they can't handle it. But exposure therapy, which goes back to the 60s, is the leading intervention for things like

[00:00:31] PTSD, phobias, social anxiety, OCD, and health anxiety. But to get someone to get there means you have to get them across this process of readiness for change. This this model of pre-contemplation to contemplation to ready to take action. If your wife is like, so is the idea that you use cognitive behavioral therapy to bridge the gap until they're ready for exposure therapy? Sometimes sometimes if someone's so pre-contemplation or so wetted in their rituals and we see people who are literally scrubbing walls with Lysol and bleach where the walls are down to the studs. That's more for things like contamination based OCD.

[00:01:06] People are doing behaviors that require almost hospital level care. Some of them are not ready for exposure based therapy. And in that case, I'd probably recommend someone if they're not on medication probably seriously consider medication. But exposure therapy is the first line treatment for almost everything to do with OCD and health anxiety. Once you get them ready for the exposure, you have to um you can say that once you get them ready, but I'm never walking into a client with OCD or health anxiety not thinking I'm not gonna do exposure therapy. They're going to be getting it some.

[00:01:33] So if I came to you and said, um, but I'm I'm an exposure therapist. Okay. So, so I don't know if this is a realistic enough example. So I'm going to So if it's not, just say, Peter, that's not how these people present. So, let's say I said, um, Josh, I, um, you know, I travel a lot for work, but, um,

[00:01:52] I got to tell you, with all this news around, um, air traffic controllers going, you know, uh, losing sight of airplanes, I don't know if I can fly anymore. This has now actually posed a real risk to my career. My career depends on me being able to get on a plane every week to go and meet my uh, my clients or whatever it is I do. Um, this is a real world scenario, by the

[00:02:14] There are people that are having increases in aerophobia or fear of flying way more than we had in the last few years because of stuff that's going on. This is this is real stuff. So So yeah, so the environmental trigger is there has been a rash of airplane crashes coupled with objective data that say air traffic controllers are overworked and the system is failing and something bad is going to happen.

[00:02:35] And unfortunately my job necessitates that I'm on the road, you know, all the time and I can't take buses. It's too far. I can't take trains. Basically, I'm going to lose my job if I'm not willing to get on a plane every Monday and come back every Thursday. And I can't seem I just don't know how to do it. And I've got two I got two weeks of PTO. I'm going to do a little bit of medical leave, but I'm running out of options.

[00:02:58] What is the exposure therapy for that specifically? So, let's let's step back. Exposure therapy again is one of usually four techniques. One of them is called invivo exposure and that is Latin for in life meaning you're actually doing real things with real objects. If I had a fear of podcasting and public speaking coming in here would be a great invivo exposure. Um there's something called imaginal exposure. Imaginal exposure is actually writing a narrative down or a story which sometimes we do it with trauma. Sometimes we do it with imaginal situations that have never happened. So those are two different kinds of imaginal exposure but you're essentially coming up with a story that you're going to write down and record and listen to.

[00:03:35] So this is just the first part of exposure therapy as I'm describing. There's a second part that's even more important to me. Um the third kind of exposure is interosceptive exposure and that's commonly used for people who have health anxiety, physical symptoms or panic disorder. And in this case we're actually inducing real lowgrade physical symptoms like eye blurriness, rapid breathing, sweating, tummy aches, um arm soreness. If you and I sit here and do a two-minute plank, my arms are going to be wobbly. So, I'm inducing things that people experience in the real world that immediately make them freak out, think they're having a panic attack, think they're having

[00:04:12] You're saying if somebody is worried about eye blurriness, you're going to put eye drops in their eye? I'm not going to put eye drops in their eyes. We're probably going to look at an iPad that has these sort of cool visuals that's going to make their eyes there's all these optical illusions I What about the What about the tummy aches? How do you induce that?

[00:04:26] You have someone spin in a chair. You have someone um you you have someone sort of do some cardiovascular exercise in your office like sitting up and down sitting up and down very quickly. Um you have someone spin on a baseball bat creating nauseous nauseous nauseousness and queasiness is not hard to induce.

[00:04:41] We're not having someone eat something or ingest something because that's going I think one step further than you need to. But you can create any sort of physical symptom from leg soreness to a headache kind of symptom to a tummy ache to tight shoulders to cotton mouth. people who have a fear fear of swallowing um who have like dry, you know, fear of like something getting clogged in their throat. You can recreate almost any physical, not medical, physical symptom safely. If you never go on a treadmill and work out, we're going to create 95% of the symptoms that people experience. They have a panic attack. If you go to a really high level of a treadmill or an elliptical, I'm going to create all those symptoms, but I'm not going to bring exercise equipment to my office.

[00:05:18] So I am helping people bring real world physical symptoms to light in my safe laboratory in a safe place and I'll get to the second part of the port point of exposure in a second just so they can experience a thing that they're terrified to experience but they already experience it out there. Nothing we do in exposure therapy have they not already experienced. The fourth kind is just called media augmented or virtual reality exposure therapy and is that people who are using either 3D goggles, virtuality goggles, videos, audio audio clips um to use sort of AV audiovisisual tools that are kind of mimicking the invivo and imaginal and intraceptive experience. And that can be something as elaborate as real world simulators, virtual ready goggles, um or even like watching, you know, a flight land on

[00:06:04] YouTube 20 times in a row to see what happens when the flight comes down. All those things we treat people who have um audio and tactile things like misophonia, which is a high sensitivity to sounds or people who are afraid of hearing something. So anything that brings that that tool into the place using audio video that's part one of exposure therapy which is you and a patient have come up with an elaborate hierarchy ladder a list of easy medium and hard scenarios in their mind that they think that they could some point do. Most people think they can never do the hard ones and they almost always do successfully.

[00:06:37] Um and you're coming up with this hierarchy based on what you asked about that first meeting, that first session, that second session. And I'm collecting a lot of raw data to figure out what are the things in their life that are triggering them that I can recreate to help them face their fears headon and come up with new learning. And so Peter, back in the 60s and 70s, we thought that habituation or just getting used to it was the creme de la creme of exposure therapy. And we found out that that wasn't really solving it. And then we started shifting more towards cognitive models. That not not just habituation and being in a distressed moment but actually now coming up with new meaning about it which is called inhibitory learning.

[00:07:18] That was really started at a seinal article in 1986 by um Michael Kak and Ednfo. Ednfo is one of the pioneers of exposure therapy both in PTSD and OCD and um has done amazing work out of UPEN. Um her um Marty Franklin a bunch of people at the UPEN sort of were the pioneers of exposure therapy. In ' 86 they they pioneered an article that taught us that habituation or just getting used to symptoms. It helps but it's not really getting people moving further. And so when you start having these corrective experiences when you start unlearning what you thought was going to happen which anxiety is all about anticipating something and being colossally wrong. Thank God we need to get people to experience being wrong in a situation that mimics what they actually experience. So exposure therapy has shifted from just a behavioral physiological model to a cognitive model. And that cognitive model is helping people process that information after the exposure. So you just did some weird stuff for 20 to 45 minutes. whether you're huffing and puffing, practicing giving a speech to a screen, um putting yucky things on your hands if you have OCD, uh germ OCD, um if you're afraid of, you know, bugs and spiders, you know, maybe going to a local pet shop and looking at spiders behind a glass tank or putting, you know, spiders that are in like resin, fake spiders that are dead, like on your arms. All sorts of things that start whatever it is that you can create that sense of fight, flight, or freeze, that sense of fear, that sense of dread. So your amydala starts producing the chemicals that you experience in your own life in my private safe place. Sometimes we go out in the community. We go to restaurants and shops and do odd weird things. And so we're doing that to have people experience that stuff, but also not engage in rituals and compulsions.

[00:08:59] So exposure therapy is a combination of doing things that bring on a sense of safe, predictable, but uncomfortable emotional, physical feelings while also not doing the mental and behavioral things that bring it back down. And if you can stay in that state for 30 to 45 minutes and do that multiple times a week, Peter, you start learning real distress tolerance, real resiliency skills. you start disproving that the thing that I thought I had to do either to avoid it alto together or to undo this sense of dread or feeling if I don't undo that and I sit with it maybe just maybe when it happens in the real world I don't have to pop a pill I don't have to run home I don't have to wash my hands I don't have to wear the mask and so we're combining inducing a sense of um arousal psychophysiological arousal cognitive interpretations that are usually faulty not doing things to bring it down and stay with that doing a few different interactive things through 30 to 45minute experiences and then afterwards processing those lessons learned.
