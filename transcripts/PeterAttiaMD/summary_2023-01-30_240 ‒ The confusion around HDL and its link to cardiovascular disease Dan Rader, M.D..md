Dan Rader is a Professor at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, where he conducts translational research on lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis with a particular focus on the function of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). In this episode, Dan goes in-depth on HDL biology, including the genesis of HDL, its metabolism, function, and how this relates to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). He explains why having high HDL-C levels does not directly translate to a low risk of cardiovascular disease and reveals research pointing to a better way to measure the functionality of HDL and predict disease risk. He also goes into detail on the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport and the benefits this has for reducing ASCVD. Additionally, Dan discusses the latest thinking around the association between HDL cholesterol and neurodegenerative diseases and ends the conversation with a discussion of how the latest research on HDL provides a promising outlook for ongoing trials and future therapeutic interventions.

We discuss:
-The lipidology of apoB and apoA [4:00];
-A primer on the high-density lipoprotein (HDL): genesis, structure, and more [9:30];
-How the lipoprotein system differs in humans compared to other mammals [20:00];
-Clarifying the terminology around HDL and apoA [25:30];
HDL metabolism [31:45];
-CETP inhibitors for raising HDL-C: does it reduce CVD risk? [34:45];
-Why it’s so important to have hard outcome trials in the field of cardiovascular medicine [42:30];
-SR-B1: an HDL receptor important for cholesterol efflux [48:00];
-The association between HDL levels and atherosclerosis: are they causally linked? [53:15];
-How insulin resistance is impacting HDL, and how HDL-C provides insights into triglyceride metabolism [58:00];
-Disappointing results from the studies of niacin—a drug that raises HDL-C and lowers apoB [1:08:15];
-HDL lipidation, dilapidation, and reverse cholesterol transport [1:12:00];
-Measuring the cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL:  a better predictor of ASCVD risk than HDL-C? [1:22:00];
-A promising new intervention that may promote cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport [1:32:45];
-The association between HDL cholesterol and neurodegenerative diseases [1:34:00];
-Challenges ahead, a promising outlook, and the next frontier in lipidology [1:44:45]; and
-More

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Dan Rader discussing HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) biology and its relationship to cardiovascular disease. The conversation explores the complexity of HDL metabolism, its functions, and why it's been challenging to develop therapeutic interventions targeting HDL. The discussion highlights how HDL biology is significantly more complex than LDL biology, and why measuring HDL cholesterol alone may not be sufficient to understand its protective effects.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- HDL is characterized by APO A1 protein, unlike APO B-containing lipoproteins [00:06:39]
- HDL particles are about 1/5 to 1/10 the size of LDL particles [00:44:24]
- ABCA1 is crucial for HDL formation; humans lacking ABCA1 have virtually undetectable HDL [00:12:07]
- HDL cholesterol acts as an integrator of metabolic health, similar to HbA1c for glucose metabolism [00:57:10]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Don't rely solely on high HDL as protection against cardiovascular disease [00:54:40]
- Consider HDL function rather than just HDL cholesterol levels [01:25:59]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Niacin was historically used to raise HDL but proved ineffective in outcome trials [01:09:24]
- CETP inhibitors failed to show significant cardiovascular benefits [01:39:00]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- HDL cholesterol measurement alone is insufficient [01:28:02]
- HDL efflux capacity testing may be available clinically within 2-3 years [01:25:59]
- Current lab measurements include HDL-C, HDL-P (particle number), and APO A1 [01:32:38]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"HDL cholesterol is not directly and causally protective against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease" [01:41:00]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- How will emerging HDL function tests be implemented clinically?
- What role might HDL play in neurodegenerative disease prevention?
- How can we better measure HDL functionality in routine clinical practice?
