## Description

Original release date: 4/29/19

In this episode, Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D., discusses the widespread impact of stress on our physical and emotional health as well as the mechanisms by which it can precipitate chronic illness, dementia, depression, and more. He also provides insight into the factors that contribute to the stress response (and our ability to handle it) such as social rank, personality, environment, and genetics. Lastly, we discuss how our behavior is altered in the face of stress and how that not only has a pervasive effect on a personal level, but also on society as a whole in how we interact with each other.

We discuss:
-Background, interest in stress, and Robert’s time in Kenya studying baboons [7:00];
-Physiology of a stress response, and why it’s ingrained in our DNA [14:00];
-Individual variation in the response to stress, and how everyone has a different optimal level [24:00];
-How social rank and personality differences affect our stress response [30:15];
-What’s happening in the brain when faced with stressful situations? [39:15];
-What makes the human brain different than all other species? [48:15];
-Imprinting stress to your kids epigenetically [52:00];
-The role of stress on memory and the consequences of hypercortisolemia [57:15];
-The impact of subjective socioeconomic status and social media on stress levels and health [1:01:45];
-Tips for managing stress in the modern world [1:17:45];
-What Robert learned about himself studying the social behavior of baboons [1:29:30];
-The multilayered factors behind every human behavior, the context of “good and bad”, and exploring the human capacity of the wild extremes of violence and altruism from moment to moment [1:34:30];
-PMS: How two women with identical hormone levels can have completely different emotional experiences [1:39:00];
-How much of a role do genes play in depression and other emotional states? [1:42:45];
-Why is cortisol elevated under sleep deprivation? [1:50:15];
-The impact of stress on cancer [1:54:30];
-The impact of stress on atherosclerosis, dementia, addiction, and depression [2:01:15];
-Impulsiveness, impaired judgement, and lack of empathy in times of stress [2:05:45];
-What advice would Robert give his 25-year-old self? [2:12:45]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive with Robert Sapolsky:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Robert Sapolsky, a renowned neuroscientist and stress researcher, discussing the biological mechanisms of stress and their impact on health. The conversation covers the evolution of stress responses, the role of glucocorticoids (cortisol), and how chronic stress affects various body systems, particularly the brain. Key themes include the relationship between social status and stress, the impact of modern technology on stress levels, and the biological basis of human behavior.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Glucocorticoids and adrenaline are the two main stress hormone systems [00:15:52]
- Cortisol takes about 30 seconds to be released after a stressful event [00:15:52]
- The amygdala plays a crucial role in fear and anxiety responses [00:50:11]
- Chronic stress causes hippocampal atrophy and memory problems [00:59:46]
- Sleep deprivation increases cortisol levels [01:48:30]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Practice daily stress management rather than weekly sessions [01:25:14]
- Limit email checking to specific times of day [01:28:28]
- Maintain consistent sleep schedules [01:44:30]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Develop social support networks to buffer stress effects [02:05:45]
- Identify personal stress triggers and minimize exposure [01:29:40]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Limited discussion of specific supplements, though beta blockers were mentioned in context of stress response studies [00:48:01]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
Aerobic exercise mentioned as beneficial for stress management [01:27:08]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- 24-hour glucose monitoring [01:19:36]
- Urinary cortisol levels [01:29:40]
- Morning resting heart rate [01:28:28]

8. **References & Resources**:
Books mentioned:
- "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers" by Robert Sapolsky [00:04:12]
- "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" [00:04:12]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Stress doesn't kill you outright very often, but it sure makes other things that kill you more effective at doing it." [00:08:51]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the most effective interventions for reducing chronic cortisol elevation?
- How does early life stress programming affect later disease risk?
- What role does genetics play in stress susceptibility?

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter thea m.d. calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating or something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level it makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest today is

[00:04:12] Professor Robert Sapolsky and many of you may recognize that name because Robert has written some incredible books probably the one that you would recognize the most is why zebras don't get ulcers a guide to stress stress-related diseases and coping but he's also the author of a primates memoir which grew out of work that he spent in his early years in Africa and he spent nearly 30 years in Africa for months at a time the trouble with testosterone and other essays on the biology of the human predicament and his most recent book behaved the biology of humans at our best and worst this is a book that Roberts spent nearly four years researching and writing and the book is almost 800 pages long this is a treatise on the topic of human biology and behavior Robert is a professor of biological sciences at

[00:04:58] Stanford where he's been I believe since he completed his PhD and his postdoc which he did back on the East Coast he spent a lot of time in Kenya right after college he went to Kenya then Uganda where he studied for the next 30 years the behavior of baboons and other primates he is a MacArthur Fellow in 1987 he was awarded the fellowship which many of you may recognize by its other name the genius grant he is very modest and soft-spoken about this and really doesn't doesn't like to be reminded of that but Robert is a really impressive guy today is actually the first time we really met in person I had seen him speak about a year and a half ago and after the talk you know introduced myself and we spoke very briefly but I remember during his talk thinking to myself this is the first time I'm really being convinced at the true pathology of stress I think I had certainly appreciated the benefits of meditation before when it came to being less miserable but I think it was really

[00:05:54] Roberts work and in particular that presentation on that day that got me to really start to think about the molecular and physiological hypercortisolism so we talked a great deal about that in this discussion but we also talked about things that go far outside of that we talked about the role of depression we talked about the impact of stress on the developing brain and also in the brain later in life and even some of the areas where the relationship between stress and disease is not as well understood and that clearly came across in our discussion of cancer overall I found this discussion riveting and I could have continued this discussion for many hours longer on a personal level I was also you know really kind of touched by the way he spoke about this sort of chain in heart he had around the relentless ambition and pursued and how over the past few years he's really really at that and that comes across at the end when we sort of get into more of a philosophical discussion about what one would do different given what he knows today it was an honor to spend so much time with Robert today discussing this and I appreciated the confidence he had in basically sight unseen sitting down with a stranger to have this discussion so I hope you'll enjoy this discussion with Robert half as much as I do

[00:07:09] Robert thank you so much for making the time to meet with me today on a lovely rainy San Francisco afternoon sure I'll have to be indoors here as I was saying earlier we had met once before really briefly so brutally that you would not remembered and of course only I would summer of 17 I believe you were giving a talk in Sun Valley and I was there and you gave a talk on stress now it was to a lay audience so you didn't really get to go into the depth and I remember sitting in the audience thinking oh you know a lot of what he's saying is really starting to make sense to me and I can't wait to get a little deeper into this stuff because truthfully and I'm just gonna open with sort of my Mia culpa you've always heard people say stress kills and I gotta be honest with you I always thought that was sort of nonsense

[00:07:58] I was like come on what do you mean stress kills stress is good it builds resilience blah blah what is the mechanism by which stress quote-unquote kills but of course once you start to understand the endocrine system and of course training as a surgeon and not an endocrinologist I sort of missed out on that you start to see it and in that talk you admittedly at a sort of high level for the audience really walked through the danger of hypercortisolism so in many ways I guess you know a year and a half ago was really when I became a fan of your work and then kind of said you know what there is something to this so anyway with that I appreciate you taking this time sure and just to sort of back off a bit from that I actually don't think stress kills you outright very often but it sure makes other things that kill you more effective at doing it maybe it's semantics but you're right stress can amplify and accelerate the diseases of Aging you grew up in New

[00:08:51] York right if I recall your Europe Brooklyn or in Brooklyn I remember reading that after college you actually went straight off to Kenya first is that right yep what prompted that well I was one of those I've sort of spent my career oscillating between being a lab neuroscientist studying the effects of cortisol on the brain punchline two decades of work is you don't want to have a whole lot of it marinating inside your head but also for more than 30 years I've alternated spending my summers studying a population of wild baboons in a national park in East Africa and it's the same animals I go back to each year these are animals like in dart anesthetize get blood to whole workups on them and essentially asking among them what does your social rank have to do with patterns of stress-related disease what does your personality what does your patterns of social affiliation so it's been sort of a counterbalance to the lab where you know we've been sticking artificial genes into neurons and fairly reductive stuff like that so

[00:09:59] I was actually about eight years old when I decided I wanted to be a primatologist so I was kind of planning on that for a long time and lucked out I spent all of college brown-nosing the right person who shipped me off to a field site right after graduation and I wound up sort of inheriting that site and those have been my my baboons ever since did you spend the whole time in

[00:10:24] Kenya I remember reading that you also were in Uganda and obviously there I think if my geography is correct their neighbours so that's a pretty easy switch where do the actual baboons like what is their scope of their residents how broadly oh they're spread actually all over Africa they're one of the most ubiquitous primates for a lot of the same reasons that we are which is they'll eat anything they're carnivores but they're also per Boers they're omnivores they scavenge dead stuff they eat insects they'll they'll eat most anything so they can fill a lot of niches so they're scattered everywhere but my main work for the years has been this one troop in the Serengeti and

[00:11:04] West Kenya you know for about 25 years I camped under the same tree so it's really it's been continuity with the same population of animals what is their natural predator besides man leopards lions hyenas nonetheless if you're a male baboon the most likely thing to kill you violently is another male yeah exactly sort of like humans yes indeed did you say it's every summer or every other summer well it was initially for about 25 straight summers and then parenthood and all those complications came in so wanted to being every other summer and then our kids were old enough to go with us one summer but unfortunately the fieldwork ended about eight years ago so why is that my Kenyan field assistant of 30 years we we started together when we were 20 he died of AIDS political issues there some game park issues that made it harder and harder to sort of get research done and kind of that middle aged realization that I could find some new game park or new country or something and started all over but it was kind of time to pack it in instead so after you did your PhD which he did it in North New York right yeah Rockefeller University did you come straight out to Stanford for a postdoc or postdoc to the Salk Institute San

[00:12:28] Diego spent a couple of years there if people are sort of familiar with the hypothalamic hormone that runs the stress response a hormone CRH CRF corticotropin-releasing hormone I went and post talked with this guy Wiley Vale who had discovered it in like two years before so that was a pretty exciting time to be there so spent a couple of years there stanford hired me and I've been there for thirty-one years since that's kind of amazing I keep coming back to people at Stanford that you know would have been there when I was there in medical school but if it wasn't in the medical school like you just weren't paying as close attention and I honestly don't recall if you ever gave us a lecture in med school do you remember giving lectures in med school 20 plus years ago I did almost certainly the students were paying as little attention as I was so to say it certainly seems like something we should have been nina learning in medical school and yet i feel ashamed to say i don't know if i recall it it was not much of an emphasis and was sort of snuck in embarrassedly like a lunchtime seminars yeah exactly so that thrived them with free food that's an even still only about five people would stay past the cookies that's a much bigger issue we can come to so so you wrote a book gosh how many years ago was why zebras don't get ulcers that's that twenty years ago let's see first edition was ninety four it's gone through three editions now most recent one was 2004 so at some point i got to do another one as we talked about that and you've written a book more recently that i want to talk about as well let's back up and explain something you touched on a second ago which is sort of the physiology of a stress response so walk us through the relationship between the hypothalamus the pituitary and the adrenal glands so when we're under stress levels of 11d different hormones change in our body most of them are relatively minor players the two workhorses overwhelmingly first one famously adrenaline british term epinephrine sort of north american term output from the sympathetic nervous system it's on the scene and your bloodstream within one two seconds or so after all hell breaks loose and i just want to explain what sympathetic means to the listener we've had this discussion before it's not to say it's a nervous system that is kind it just means it's one of the two branches of these so-called autonomic or immediate not under your conscious control right so the fight-or-flight exactly and the other half being parasympathetic sympathetic fight-or-flight all hell breaking loose alarms going off parasympathetic calm vegetative function so not only do you turn on the sympathetic during stress you very emphatically turn off the parasympathetic second main workhorse which has already been alluded to the steroid hormone class of hormones called glucocorticoids human version cortisol known as hydrocortisone rat version corticosteroids synthetic versions prednisone dexamethasone and such these come out of the adrenal glands your brain note something stressful is happening within two seconds your hypothalamus is secreting that CRH which within about 10 seconds is getting your pituitary to release a hormone called

[00:15:52] ACTH which within about 30 seconds has gotten to your adrenals and you are slowly starting the glucocorticoid component of your stress response and in lots of ways the adrenaline the sympathetic response the coracoid response they work on hand and hand these synergize you want a metaphore adrenaline in two seconds as handing guns out of the gun locker it's whoever is going to defend you glucocorticoids are building the aircraft carriers that a year from now are going to be essential it does some of the slower components and the stress response

[00:16:29] Springs stretching out over minutes to hours because I was just about to ask you and I think your question basically answers it was why would we have evolved these two separate systems one can only speculate on such things but it's basically that certainly norepinephrine epinephrine they stick around for such a short period of time I mean we don't even measure these things clinically I can't poke your arm and measure your norepinephrine or epinephrine level the best I can do is collect its metabolites in your urine for evidence that it's been around so I guess we have this hormone or pair of hormones that are on the scene in seconds gone in seconds and really deal with the I guess from an evolutionary perspective when the tiger is there this is what gets you to jump into the tree is it doing much beyond that and is there some evidence of chronic low levels of those hormones which come out of a totally different part of the adrenal gland I mean that's the other thing that's sort of interesting is you have two separate pieces that cortex the medulla that secrete these hormones separately and embryologically there are two very different tissues they start off separately it could have just as randomly wound up that your adrenaline comes from your big toe and glucocorticoids from your thumbs why they being in the same organ Imus in fact somewhat just I think serendipitous probably because you're more likely to have your toes and fingers lopped off and we wouldn't want to have incidental adrenalectomy is happening you're right that's certainly why they didn't wind up what about in lower species is one of these considered more primitive is the epinephrine arm something that began earlier and the cortisol are more recent yep nonetheless the court alarm is chest ancient when you get stressed the new you're secreting glucocorticoids it's basically the exact same class of molecules as if you were a fish or bird or reptile nonetheless it's a very ancient wiring and that's part of what winds up getting us in trouble it's a system that's been serving vertebrates doing a lot of help for them for an awful long time and it's been a very recent modification to instead secrete them in a response to thinking about taxes this basic dichotomy between the very human domains where we activate the stress response and the the more typical domains of animals so if you and

[00:18:50] I were sitting here ten thousand years ago I can think of lots of things that we would want an adrenaline response for you know the tiger jumps out of the thing whatever what are some of the things that would result in that cortisol response because you know you described it as building the aircraft carrier well you know gosh if the Tigers there I either I'm dead or I'm not but I don't need a stress response a day from now or the next day so what is it that cortisol was doing 10,000 years ago that was serving our interests I want to certainly talk about what it's not doing today when you look at what it does it actually makes perfect sense as long as you are being stressed like a normal mammal running for your life running after a meal where if you don't catch something you're going to be dead by tomorrow a short-term physical crisis the first five seconds of doing that which epinephrine is critical for that's great if we're heading into a couple of minutes of evading a predator being vigilant thinking there might be if you were getting into the realm with a couple of minutes worth of a stress response cortisol related corticoid hormones are absolutely essential so the glucose that's coming rushing out of your liver pretty important in that situation exactly so it takes you about one second to decide you're going to use your thigh muscles and run like mad you need energy for him and the main thing glucocorticoids are doing in the metabolic realm is glucocorticoids they're increasing glucose levels in your bloodstream they're going to storage sites throughout your body your liver your muscle and breaking stuff that what they do is they go to the bank they empty out your savings accounts and turn it into cash glucose in the bloodstream to hand to whichever muscles or gonna save your neck what they also do makes better perfect sense were three you were running for your life or run for a meal which is they increase cardiovascular tone in epinephrine is doing the first five seconds of it by 30 seconds and glucocorticoids you're bolstering it as well and it's that same logic you're running like crazy you want to deliver that glucose to your thigh muscles as quickly as possible you increase your heart rate you increase your breathing rate your blood pressure you alter your vasculature so you're preferentially shunting to the exercising muscle so that makes perfect sense also turns out some of the most interesting stuff glucocorticoids do in those circumstances is basically run a triage program they shut down everything that's not essential not essential to surviving the next five minutes of this massive physical challenge so digestion with digestion exactly you got better things to do than digest breakfast when you're trying to avoid being somebody's lunch and you're sure not going to get any metabolic benefits of digestion during this five minutes it's slow expensive the energy you're getting you're getting from your liver you're getting from your fat cells it shuts down growth obvious logic there you know grow antlers tomorrow if you're still around to umballa right now shuts off reproduction same logic there it shuts off all the long-term building projects and just focuses your energies on what's immediately there and this makes makes sense if you are running for your life running after meal and all you need to do is look at a couple of diseases where people don't turn on the endocrine stress response Addison's disease shy-drager syndrome whatever these are not diseases where somebody who now is more at risk for adult onset diabetes eight months from now these are diseases where somebody goes running after their commuter bus and they dropped it from hypoglycemic shock JFK had this didn't

[00:22:39] JFK have Addison's he had Addison's and that greatly constrained the the famed pictures of all those Kennedys playing touch football out and you know Martha's Vineyard or stuff were mostly for the benefit of the photographer's how did he survive World War two because he had done some pretty heroic things in that war although I've seen it's hard to tell if it's snarky revisionism as to how much that was public relations stuff afterward sort of orchestrated but just to get through basic training even strikes me as an accomplishment because most people I guess who don't have a medical background wouldn't appreciate this but the tan that seemed to be eternally on JFK is the result of the

[00:23:23] Addison's disease because the hormone you alluded to earlier that is released by the pituitary acth in someone who's not making cortisol is gonna be very very high an ACTH stimulates the pigment producing cells in the skin and that's what would give someone with Addison's disease darker skin the fascinating thing with Kennedy is if it were this situation now presumably his doctors would be on the air somewhere 24/7 this there's remarkably little known about when is onset was when the worst of it was how severe it was so it's not quite clear but what little is known is it had a hell of an impact on this functioning you really do need a hormone if you like glucocorticoids if you were going to be physically activated in a moment of crisis this is sort of the amazing thing with hormones like insulin and cortisol

[00:24:16] I'm always impressed by how tight the u-shape is on those curves Tyron hormone would be another example certainly less so with something like testosterone you have just a much wider range that you can function in and the benefit is largely monotonically increasing sometimes if my patients will tolerate me going on and on about this I love to draw the pictures of which of these hormones can you you know but to me cortisol probably if you thought of it as a drug it has the narrowest therapeutic index to your point too much of it will kill you eventually and make you miserable as hell on the way and too little of it will kill you quite quickly and what's most interesting about it is okay so there's an optimal level among other ways of translating that that means we don't hate stress we hate the wrong amount of stress when it's the right amount we love it we pay money to be stressed to get on a roller coaster to go to a scary movie when it's the right amount when it's the optimal amount and we call it stimulation okay so exactly as you say it's a narrow range so that's a tough biological problem understanding a hormonal system that's pretty damn essential and we're an awful lot of the time you're walking on a knife edge we're either side as bad news too much or too little but when it comes to glue corticoids and what counts as good stress and stimulation there's the added factor that there's incredible individual variation as to what counts is the optimal level in between and one person's like hair-raising Audubon

[00:25:55] Society walk one Saturday morning looking for birds while the other person goes and signs up to be a mercenary in Yemen because that's when they feel alive and awake and all of that not only that it's a narrow range but we differ so much as to what each person's optimum is now I want to make sure I understand that point Robert and this is probably overly simplistic so feel free to correct this one of it would be the external scenario that is being perceived and I can see definitely how two people can have vastly different views on that I mean it's the reason someone can voluntarily go and be in a VC land someone can say I'd feel much better not doing that right there's clearly a different appetite and/or capacity for distress is that what you're referring to or are you also referring to you and I could be sitting here and have different levels of physiologic benefit and harm at the same level of cortisol both ice absolutely I mean the former I think most people would acknowledge the latter is pretty new right I mean every reduction is a pretty new that's not intuitive to me because there's centuries of

[00:27:08] Endocrinology saying what's the most important thing about hormones how much of the stuff there is in your bloodstream what the levels are in a few and I are sitting here with the same circulating levels of whatever centuries of dogma was that will translate into the same biological effects and then I don't know sort of endocrine revolution of 70s 80s or so turns out how loud someone is yelling at you counts what the hormone levels are how sensitively you can hear them the levels of your receptors and target cells turn out to be essential as well and there's all sorts of endocrine domains where in fact screwie receptor levels are much more consequential and impactful than our screwie levels of the hormone itself and individual differences in levels of receptors what version you have how well it works how avidly it holds on to the hormone what it is then coupled with afterward downstream inside the cell that whole world turns out to be as central to understanding individual differences as are the levels of hormones themselves and as sensitive to all those things ranging from genes to prenatal environment to early develop and to psychological factors and so on so yeah that's a huge piece of the story now when I hear you say it like that

[00:28:35] Robert it seems pretty obvious because we would talk about insulin in exactly that way you could have two people with the exact same level of insulin completely different physiologic response because of insulin sensitive when insulin hits its receptor it leads to the phosphorylation of a ETA KT and that's what leads to the glute for transporter coming up to the surface and different people with the same insulin can do that totally differently and different people will have a different insulin response to the same food to the same meal that's the reason we do glucose tolerance tests so you could basically say someone is cortisol sensitive in cortisol resistant to make the analogy to insulin at the end product and absolutely if you're an obsessive with cortisol stuff in the 80s there was briefly this deep puzzle and that it turned out New World monkeys monkeys in South America marmosets tamarins or whatever when you compare them to traditional old-world monkeys the Asian the african once turns out they have like an order of magnitude higher glucocorticoid levels oh my god that's crazy what's that about all sorts of theorize about how for some reason it's more stressful to be a new world primate than an old world which didn't make a whole lot of sense and then there was this issue of these animals should have been falling out of trees from their very Cushing's disease and and finally somebody found an explanation no somewhere back when there was a mutation in the gene for the glucocorticoid receptor in new world primates and as roughly 1/10 the sensitivity so the system just equilibrated out in a different set point but that's such a great example of just natural variation not only in how loudly you speak hormone but how effectively your cells listen to hormone do you have a sense in the human population today I mean a log full difference that you just described sounds extreme but you have a sense of what the variability is in humans today is it a twofold threefold Delta on the receptor side gut feeling and reflecting the fact that my world the brain you don't get to measure receptor levels anywhere near as easily as in a white blood cell well under an order of magnitude we just acknowledged or you just pointed out that when a zebra sees a lion everything that happens as far as the fast end what I would call the acute and the sub acute stress response is perfectly evolutionarily sound and completely in the best interest of that zebra we could also come up with a countless examples of 10,000 years ago or even today when the same thing is true in humans when did that transition occur in our species to where you started to see either something in the civilization or society that was unhealthy so today I could point to a thousand examples social media you name it I mean it's an infinite number when did that start to crop up what does your research suggest is the arrival of that

[00:31:34] I think it predated us being humans and instead as a feature of smart social mammals because you see indices of stress-related stuff baboons that's what I've spent my whole career on and other non-human primates cetaceans elephants and such okay so why study baboons if you're trying to understand human stress and it turns out they perfectly illustrate the point you just brought up if you're a baboon living in the

[00:32:05] Serengeti in East Africa your life is pretty good it's a fantastic echo system baboons they live in these big troops fifty two hundred animals or so so they really don't have to worry about lions very often the infant mortality rate is lower than among the neighboring Masai tribes people and probably most importantly unless it's a once a generation drought if you're just a baboon coming about your everyday business it takes you about three hours a day to get your day's calories and that has a critical implication which is if you only need to spend three hours of sunlight each day getting enough food to get by you've got nine hours of free time every day to devote to being miserable to some other baboon and that's the key thing they are well-off enough in our westernized sense that they can sit around and generate psychological stress for each other overwhelmingly if you're a baboon in the

[00:33:09] Serengeti and you're miserable it's because another baboons have worked very hard to bring that state about they're wonderful models for westernize disease in that very few of us get hypertensive because you know Tigers are chasing us instead it's psychosocial stuff that we invent and that we can wallow in for hours every day and that's exactly what baboons do through great models for westernized stress do we have evidence I mean I'm sure it exists but in the humans I would just be willing to bet that if you and I were subjected to the same external stressor

[00:33:46] I would probably internalize it more than you that's my guess so if we were both baboons and there was a third baboon tormenting us is it safe to say that you could be the baboon that would roll with it more than me individual differences like that absolutely my guess is both of us would respond to it by saying I'm just gonna get a longer and longer CV and then he's gonna regret it someday pushing me around they'll be sorry when they see how many degrees I have but yeah individual differences one of the things that I focused on you know

[00:34:19] I spent my first ten years deciding rank and status social status is everything if you're a baboon and you got a choice in the matter you want to be high-ranking because on the average you have lower glue corticoid levels your resting blood pressures lower all sorts of stuff works better but what took me some growing up out there to do was to realize that that yeah social rank is important far more important is the contextual meaning of your rank is that the same as your perception of your rank or is there there's more to it right well it's what the rank means in your particular troop you can be a low ranking guy in one of two different troops and one troop simply because of its culture and that's a perfectly scientific world word to use for another species these days in one troop being low ranking can be a whole lot crappier than another troop in terms of how often somebody in a bad mood displays as aggression on you in terms of how often somebody actually grooms you and off of how often you get to finish a meal before somebody steals it from you kind of thing so the same exact rank means different things and different sort of baboon cultures so I'll take an extreme example in a prison there's a clear hierarchy starting with the warden the guards the inmates and of course within the inmates there's a hierarchy presumably I'm making this up but certainly the pedophiles would be at the bottom of that list and a violent criminal would probably be at the top of that list so within that hierarchy there's probably a manner in which you would be perceived as a function of that unique environment which is so artificial in its own way but that wouldn't necessarily be the same outside absolutely and one of the most interesting things about us us humans when we can't talk about across all sorts of primates being low ranking in general as bad for your health or what about humans we don't have ranking in the same system that sort of other primates do in a strict linear kind of way but the other thing about us is we belong to multiple hierarchies at once and we can have very different ranks in them so for example family work sports team it's hobby you've got some guy who's the mailroom clerk in this giant corporation and you could not possibly be lower status but he's the captain of the company softball team this year and you better bet when you ask him what's important in his life 9:00 to 5:00

[00:36:55] Monday to Friday is just a stupid way to pay the rent and what really matters is when the weekend comes around you have somebody with a horrible low status job who's the Deacon of their church you have said we belong to multiple hierarchies and we are very good psychologically at deciding that whichever hierarchy were highest in that's the one we define ourselves by let's take another extreme example which is you take people who are very successful in what they do you know whatever they're the most famous hedge fund manager or an entrepreneur that started some great company you would argue well they seem to be pretty good on the food chain but yet many of them would say you could measure objectively their hypercortisolism attic so it seems like there's even more than just that ranking right isn't there something else because they're at the top if they were baboons they're the Alpha but they're still grossly stressed out in other words thank God we're more subtle than baboons but it turns of baboons are even more subtle than just rank they have personality and you can be a high-ranking baboon and personality differences and again this is a scientifical word as as is culture if you're a high-ranking baboon and your worst rival sneezing a hundred yards away has seen as a major provocation you are gonna have much higher the coronoid levels than if you are highest-ranking baboon from whom that's no big deal and in fact often you may have higher glucocorticoid cortisol levels than if you're number ten or number twenty in the hierarchy there's lots of psychological filter stuff and I spent a ton of time studying that baboons differ as to how readily they see things as being provocative or not threatening or not you're sitting there and again your worst rival shows up and takes a nap a hundred yards away there can be two baboons of the same rank and one of them keeps doing exactly what he's doing and the other one is interrupted from whatever nice social thing is happening these agitated in these vigil and he's got a look at the guy and lunge towards him a couple of times before going back if your worst rival taking a nap is as disruptive as the guy threatening you in your face you averaged about twice the cortisol levels in your bloodstream after controlling for rank as a guy who can tell the difference between the big thing in the little thing maybe this is too deep a question and the answer isn't known but what is it that actually transmits that information through the filter of your personality into the physiology that's very well understood so I understand the bookends right I understand how the visual cortex takes the guy who's your enemy sleeping over there and trans that to your cortex and then I understand how the sympathetic chain kicks off the response is there a link in between those the processing link here's one of those filters you take people and you're flashing up faces at them stick them in a brain scanner and you're looking at how jumpy their amygdalas their amygdala central - fear anxiety aggression and such and what you see is tremendous individual differences in you show somebody a face with kind of a neutral expression does this person look happy sad angry threatening whatever and lots of variability and you look at the people who tend to view neutral expressions as threatening in other words they see threats that most other people don't what is that correlate with a bigger amygdala physically larger and make a physically larger amygdala Mikula with a higher metabolic rate and an amygdala that is more electro physiologically react and stuff let's back up for a moment I mean tell people in case they don't know where the amygdala sits what part of the brain it evolved from and why it's sort of referred to as this reptilian brain I think everybody's heard of the amygdala but I think you could explain this in a more interesting and accurate way okay amygdala is like one of the the anchors of what's called the limbic system in the brain limbic system it's the part of the brain that's all about emotion not surprisingly mammals have a whole lot more limbic development than fish dude Fisher are not famous for their emotional lives the limbic system is arousal fee or anger lust love maternal pair-bonding mother infant bonding all of that and it's a whole series of structures not surprisingly ancient in mammals not surprisingly highly complex interconnected not surprisingly sitting underneath the cortex the cortex that more recently evolved part of the brain that does your taxes all of that limbic system underneath there all this subterranean emotion stuff and amygdala is one of the limbic structures and it's involved in fear it's involved in anxiety it's involved in aggression you learn to be afraid of something or somebody that didn't used to scare you and your amygdala does the exact same sort of cellular basis of learning that goes on in other parts of your brain when you learn somebody's middle name and actually remember it your amygdala learns to be afraid of new things and when you manage to stop being afraid of something when you stop being afraid of thems because it turns out oh they're actually more similar to use than you thought or something it's your amygdala that becomes less reactive to stimuli like that's how your amygdala is absolutely central to some of our worst human moments it's so interesting because it's sandwiched between you know you can think of the human brain as having sort of very grossly three parts right this brainstem this midbrain which the amygdala you could argue is the mayor and then the cortex that you describe it's not an oversimplification

[00:43:08] I think to say that as the complexity of the organism evolved so too did that hierarchy right I mean the brainstem basically handles everything we don't have to think about ever breathing and all of those autonomic and sympathetic parasympathetic functions and then you layer on this midbrain that does everything that you said which is still kind of happening beneath consciousness and then of course there's where most of us live in our cortex where we're or where we think we live which is we're thinking these thoughts but it seems we're maybe not as aware of how influenced the cortex is by what lies beneath it exactly which is incredibly important if you think of this kind of ancient reptilian brain stem part of the brain what does it do it keeps track it makes you breathe every now and then without having to think about a boring sort of stuff then on tops the emotional

[00:43:59] Olympic system that on top is that cerebral thinking cognitive cortex thing it's very easy to come up with a conceptualization that what's fancy about humans is for example you're a lizard and the only thing that's going to change the functioning of that ancient brain stem stuff is if you're bleeding if you're too hot if you're too cold just like boring physiological states once you layer a mammalian emotional limbic system on top suddenly you can do something no lizard on earth can do you're sitting there and you're some wildebeest and some other scary will to be shows up and is peeing on some tree in your territory and nothing regulatory is changed in your body but your heart starts beating faster

[00:44:45] AHA your emotional brain can alter sort of the basic regulatory stuff down on the basement now you go one step higher and you layer a cortex on top of it and now you could do amazing stuff you sit there and you think about the fact that your heart's gonna stop beating someday and you start breathing faster and your brains then the more ancient stuff has altered as a result and you've just done something not only that no reptile can do you've just done something that no warthog can do which is think think about something that's scary or arousing or remember the time that you would and suddenly something changes down below there so there's this easy picture of sort of top-down complexity once you get to us and where the cortex can regulate your emotional brain and that regulatory brain at the bottom your emotional limbic brain can regulate what's what's far more interesting or underappreciated this is exactly what you bring up which is those lower levels can influence what's going on up above one example of this this is like this classic great study and sort of physiological psychology social psych you take people and I think in this study they would take male volunteers heterosexual male volunteers and of course they were no doubt college freshmen taking psych 101 and they had these guys walk across this really scary suspended bridge and the deal was that either halfway across the bridge you were met by from the other side a researcher who happened to be an attractive female and she would ask the volunteer some questions or what do you think of this bridge or how is it walking across this or whatever the other half of the time you would not encounter this person until you were safely out at the other end then they would ask you to evaluate the attractiveness of the person same person that same person seeing her in the middle of the bridge or at the far end exactly saying hey remember while you were doing that you there was this you know you want to rate her attractiveness was she friendly would did she seem smart with her and what you would see is guys in the middle of the bridge with their hearts racing because they're terrified would do some misinterpretation why is my heart beating so much faster than if I was standing safely so they would rate her more attractively in the middle of the bridge exactly and then was the ceiling of detail is now you do the same experiment and you give the person a beta blocker so that they don't have the accelerator and they don't rate the person as attractive is it the same with the beta blocker you get treat you you do nothing to their ratings of them is how smart they seem how kind they seem whatever it's just this okay if my heart's racing it must be because so that's a great example boring reptilian regulatory stuff down there is helping influence what do you think your emotions are that reminds me that 1995 ish movie speed with Keanu

[00:48:01] Reeves and I'm blanking our name Bullock buddy that's right Thunder Bullock we're at the end of that movie there's some cheesy line about how relationships that start under this much distress you know it's dangerous but but of course the the other read on that now is yeah if you're on a bus that's about to blow up like I think you're gonna think the chair is a track that's right potentially I'm sure

[00:48:30] Netflix will stream that from right so I've read something you wrote I can't remember where it might have been in another interview that and I didn't know this and this is a great example of why I just love to his podcast because there's never an exception to how much I'm learning it's like drinking from a firehose and you'd think I would have remembered this from medical school the neuron of a human and the neuron of some other organism when you look at it at the single cell level can't really differentiate it if I showed you two microscope slides and here's a human and here's a fish huh so what is it about and this is maybe getting us a little off-topic but I also think it feeds into this broader issue of like the stew and the alchemy of how this stuff is put together but if we all have the same neurons what is is it the number of our neurons like what is it that enables us to have all of this additional torture yeah it's incredibly interesting because

[00:49:28] I mean there's there's three and a half people on earth who have spent their entire careers being able to tell the difference between like a tree shrew neuron and a human neuron and could recognize it and their sleep but yeah for the most part we are not humans because we have invented brain areas that you don't find in other mammals or because we've invented neurotransmitters that you don't find in other vertebrates or types of neurons here's the couple of types of neurons that people used to think we're specific to humans and turns out you find them in elephants and whales also and that's plenty interesting but it's the same enzymes it's the same gene regulation it's the same you know we're sharing 98% of our

[00:50:11] DNA with a chimp or a bonobo so you say we're two humanists come from I think it's exactly the issue you talk about we have the same signal transduction pathways and neurons as you see in a fruit fly and what's the key difference is that it's not a bit humbling yes and we just think we're that special and it's the where you can take one of their genes or one of our genes and stick it in the other one and it functions just fine or you could take it from a single-cell organism some genes related to program cell death you can do that so what's the big difference for every neuron that a fruit fly has we have a hundred million and sort of the soundbite that I think summarizes all of that is with enough quantity you invent quality and this is this whole world of emergent properties of complex systems you take one ant and you put it on a table and noting that it does makes a huge amount of sense and you put 10 ants there and pretty much the same thing and you put on an O a thousand and maybe they start making a trail or something and you put 10,000 and they build a colony and they farm mushrooms and they take Athens as slaves and they could keep the temperature in the colony plus or minus two degrees and they have specialization of Labor and no ant has any more rules than he had when he was watering around on the table by himself and you put enough of them together and complex adaptive stuff emerges out of the very simple rules that each of those components has for dealing with another component it almost defies entropy doesn't it like why does that happen it's amazing that it does that and that's what our brains are we've got more ants that are coming together in our heads than does a fruit fly and you get more complex emergent stuff happening it blows my mind so let's go back to some of this stuff maybe about a year ago I read something that really frightened me because the implications were so significant if a mother is under great stress there was this critical window in which her child could see something in her eyes that would communicate that stress to her or maybe it wasn't in her eyes might have been just through her entire face but it would imprint epigenetically into the child and alter many features about them as they would age for example their propensity to be depressed man I remember reading this in sort of a lay press thing so I don't even think it got into the description of epigenetics but that was the only assumption I could make was that this must be modulated through that mechanism do you see evidence of this in animals I mean absolutely and it's one of the trendiest topics around I mean like hooray science finally recognizes childhood matters like what you've what your child are just like has a lot to do with what sort of adult you're gonna wind up being what do you know and like lots of childhood adversity versus childhood security and you know very different trajectories and what's been the huge mechanistic challenge for the field is understanding so what is it about being in a scary neighborhood or an unstable home or having a parent read to you or what is it about this whole world at developmental individual differences what are the nuts and bolts changes that occurs in the kid so that as an adult they are now thirty fold more likely than the next person for this or that to happen to them and this this whole trendy field of that kept in genetics which is early experience doesn't change your genes doesn't change your DNA sequence with some like you know circus trick exceptions you've pretty much got through DNA sequence forever what epigenetics is is early experience changing the regulation of your genes how easily you turn certain genes on how easily you turn others off in different parts of your body different parts of your brain and so on and that's exactly the sort of domain where you see the sort of stuff that you outlined so that for example if you're a fetal rat and you that rat have made a terrible decision you've picked the wrong room to be developing in and you happen to be inside a mother who's highly stressed she's secreting a lot of rat glucocorticoids which get into the circulation through the placenta and to the fetal circulation into the kid's brain and one of the things that it does is it causes an epigenetic change in the amygdala so is that rat gonna be born with a larger amygdala or is the phenotype more complicated in just size its size and a bunch of other things as an adult it's going to have a bigger amygdala and it's going to be more excitable and it's going to be more prone towards interpreting a neutral situation there's a threatening one that's virtually the definition rat anxiety disorder seeing menace that other people don't and you seem much the same evidence in humans by now early experience forget early experience what kind of kindergarten teacher yeah this is fetal early experience and this is exactly a domain where you get potentially the lifelong epigenetic effect okay so that turns out to have the hell of an implication that's just the most exciting subfield around there by now okay so you were fetus and got exposed to lots of Mom's glucocorticoid levels and as a result as an adult you've got an enlarged amygdala and you see threat all over the place that other rats don't and among other things you secrete elevated levels of glucocorticoids because the world is full of menace that only you are seeing so you get pregnant and during your pregnancy as a result your fetus is exposed to elevated glucocorticoid levels and to be clear it's not because you have altered the germline genome it's that you have changed the expression of the gene which has altered the phenotype and now that phenotype is being passed generation to generation through parallel expression exactly something termed non genetic transmission of traits non-mendelian and people have now shown some of those traits you see that ripple it gets smaller each generation but it's there half a dozen generations later and the exact equivalent of some of these have been found in humans in other words individual differences or arising not only from experience but from the multi-generational transmission of some of the consequences of experience which is just mind-boggling that that can work that way let's go back a little bit to why this is problematic so at the outset we alluded to this idea that it's a misnomer to say stress kills

[00:57:27] I'd love to hear if you have a particular definition of stress I be butchered this stuff but I sort of think of stress as the external and I think about it is it's anything that is sort of emotionally or physically either chronically or acutely distressing I mean that's sort of a dumb definition because it contains the word stress but I think people understand distress a little more than inertia in stress but of course it's your response to that physiologic response right which so so loud we can quantify this stuff in terms of what hormones are happening in the body and how the hormones are moving the body it's your response to that that probably has a greater impact on your health so let's go through three things help me understand how hypercortisolism panniers will impact the brain especially well through any timeline you want I'm obviously interested in the aging brain but I can't imagine this also doesn't impact the developing brain this is basically what I've spent my whole professional career thinking about and historically the first place where people sort of realized something scary was happening was a brain region called a hippocampus hippocampus is all about learning and memory you want to have a hippocampus it's the main brain region that's damaged in Alzheimer's disease and it's vulnerable lots of other ways um turns out it's extremely sensitive to glucocorticoids translated more reductively it's got extremely high levels of receptors corticoids by the standards of the rest of the brain and what's the evolutionary basis for that is that to have a feedback loop there's two reasons one is to have a feedback loop but the other is okay so the hippocampus remember stuff for you you don't remember everything you don't remember where you were on nine as opposed to nine eleven kind of thing your memory processes has to come with a filter saying is this one important so you're saying the cortisol amplifies memory consolidation and that you use this to consolidate stressful memories as a way of learning exactly along with epinephrine and norepinephrine indirect they have some of the same so cortisol crosses the blood-brain barrier with no difficulty exactly

[00:59:46] I assume epi and norepi do the same they have to work more indirectly heavily through the vagal nerve because they don't get in this readily but some of it is also Nura happy being released within the brain during stress it has some of its own memory enhancing effects again a great example of evolutions got this awesome system set up and it only gets out of whack when the stimulus becomes too much you do want that imprint but you don't that happening full-time or stated another way this is the reason why you don't get much out of a class if your semi-comatose and you have two hours of sleep last night you're if you're like 3/4 your glucocorticoid levels are low you're not consolidating stuff if you were out of your mind terrified because there's a lion sitting next to you you're not going to absorb much either inverse you optimal range all of that so it turns out the optimal amount of glucocorticoids something that is moderately stressful in other words something stimulating does great stuff to your hippocampus it increases blood delivery their glucose oxygen and makes the synapses the connections between neurons more excitable in the hippocampus does great stuff a little bit of arousal alertness is a good thing for learning and memory now instead transition to you are stressed 24/7 ever since you were like 10 years old kind of thing and you're in the range where glue corticoids do exactly the opposite they decrease oxygen and glucose delivery to the hippocampus they make neurons less excitable they disconnect synapse as they cause the processes in neurons to shrivel they block the birth of new neurons there they make other insults more damaging to neurons in the hippocampus what do you have there that's the world in which if you were stressed out of your mind memory doesn't work so hot and what we're increasingly realizing is if you're exposed to excessive glue corticoid levels like on the scale of years to decades you were going to make this part of the brain get older faster which speaks to something that I know you're quite passionate about which is the difference is in how socioeconomic status can sort of affect generational changes in this manner because you know use the example of a ten year old well I did my residency in Baltimore let me tell you a ten year old in inner-city

[01:02:17] Baltimore who's in the wrong house versus a ten year old in Palo Alto who's in quote-unquote at the right house and look that's not to say that you could have a ten year old in Baltimore that's got a great environment and ten year old in Palo Alto that's dealing with a whole bunch of other different issues which especially in the era of social media but all things considered probabilistically that ten year old in

[01:02:35] Baltimore is going to have a much harder time given what you just said or I don't know stated the other way I have a friend who's a cardiologist who splits his time between a hospital in Oakland and private practice in San Francisco some of the time what he's doing is dealing with eight-year-olds who are considering getting a pacemaker because the ski season is coming and they are wondering if they're gonna be in shape and time for that and maybe huh and then back in Oakland he's dealing with 50 year old elderly men who are having heart disease yeah socio-economic disparities are I won't get on my soapbox now when you look at the source of variability in health among humans on this planet socio-economic differences differences in absolute levels differences in degrees of inequality within cultures and within communities and so on is an enormous predictor of health you want to look at the most medically impacted low ranking primates you could find on earth look at poor humans because when humans invented socioeconomic status and the capacity to be poor they invented a way to subordinate the have-nots like no chimp on earth could ever dream of doing as you've alluded to there's something else to it you know recently I interviewed an amazing physician named Tom Katina who practices in the Nuba Mountains in the south of

[01:04:05] Sudan so he's the only physician to take care of 1 million people who as you No are being killed by their own government Beshear is sort of indiscriminately killing these people so my discussion with Tom was one of the most riveting discussions I've ever had with a human being it just happened to be in front of a microphone but one of the things that just as an afterthought we were discussing that it surprised me as we were going through all of the different things that people die of there you know they don't have vaccines you've got measles outbreaks that are killing people left right in the center and the trauma like you know the shrapnel blowing people apart not surprisingly they're just not getting the same chronic diseases you know and the cancers they get or not the cancer as we get and they're not getting heart disease and they're you know almost unheard of to get type 2 diabetes but what really surprised me is there was no suicide and I found that as the single most interesting thing I guess I learned from Tom which was we would look at their life and think that is an abysmal existence that I couldn't tolerate for one second and yet I would have to guess that their level of cortisol might be lower than ours even though they're in a much worse environment so whether it's that sense of community that they have or the shared purpose there's something about it so in other words my point is even in the presence of such great poverty it seems that there's ways that this can be overcome whether it's through there's no comparison to anybody else because another point he made was most of the folks there don't even know they're in Africa like they don't necessarily know that Africa is the continent in which their country resides so is the bigger issue there you think that there's no disparity so even though that's complete poverty there's no real perceived disparity or do you think it's the sense of community like what would you hypothesize explains that health that mental health all the above there's a whole world of people who study happiness along with more traditional public health people who study things like longevity you look at the quarter poorest places on earth and indeed people there don't live very long and are miserable but once you get past sort of the subsistence level there's not a great really ship between the wealth of a country GDP per capita anything and levels of happiness or life expectancy and you look at the fact that US as a shorter life expectancy than Cuba and Lebanon and Costa Rica and it's like the shame of this country kind of thing once you get past me your subsistence level income is not a great predictor of any of this stuff and that's instead where you get into morals of social capital and social support and when you look at the whole literature and you look basically at every westernized country on earth and it's now seen as they become westernized and what you see is the health socio-economic gradient the poorer you are the worse your health on the average the more of a whole array of diseases you get not all of them but a huge number the more impactful they are and when you look in the West the United

[01:07:23] States is the poster child for that we've got the steepest curve of any country on Earth and the westernized world the least steep ones are you bet of course the Scandinavian countries ever-reliable sort of utopias and then you begin to unpack why this relationship occurs and like some incredibly smart people have spent their careers looking at it the most obvious one is if you're not healthy it's very hard to pull off being the CEO of a company poor health precedes and gives rise to poor socioeconomic status ok that's plausible that turns out to explain a tiny percentage of the variability and you could look at the status socioeconomic status of the home in which a child is raised and that's a predictor of their likelihood of diabetes half a century later so absolutely the socioeconomic status comes first in explaining the vast percentage of the variability okay so next thing maybe it's just that well everybody's kind of equally healthy it's just that the really poor people are very unhealthy we have a step function no you start with Jeff Bezos and Bill

[01:08:35] Gates and every down there and statistically the lower you go down every rung of the way the poorer you are the poorer you are with respect I mean the per your health yes yes thanks so now you unpack that and what's the most obvious explanation and this is what people call a neo materialist explanation which is obvious the poorer you are you don't have healthcare access you know health insurance you can't go to the doctor is readily your care is more lousy that's obviously that explains everything that explains virtually none of the variability in the data because you see the gradient nonetheless in countries with socialized medicine universal health care you see it for diseases where it doesn't matter how often you get health care access juvenile diabetes so it shows it as an SES gradient kind of thing so it's not healthcare access you then look cross culturally and you see wildly different income levels and wildly different levels of healthcare access and you see very similar lifespans across these countries and very similar gradients so what people spent like the last 30 years doing is having this huge shift towards it's got so little to do with the material aspects of wealth or poverty it's got to do with the psychological aspects it's got to do with the stress first key finding somebody at UCSF named Nancy

[01:10:02] Adler who's done wonderful research showing okay your socioeconomic status your wealth your objective measure of wealth is indeed a predictor of your health turns out at least as good of a predictor is your subjective socioeconomic status on the level when you look at people around you how do you are you doing compared to other people where would you place yourself on this ten step ladder in terms of what's your absolute SES what's your subjective one and by asking it that way you're asking the person to consider the community that's most pertinent to them who's the comparison group my next-door neighbors

[01:10:43] Warren Buffett in between whatever when you think of other people how are you doing compared to and it turns out your subjective SES is at least as good of a predictor of your health as is your objective in other words if you took someone's income which is quite objective it would offer no more prediction than asking that person in the Nuba Mountains where do you rack up in this tribe and it's sort of like huh you know sort of top two thirds yeah exactly or another way of stating that is you look in some bloated corporation and there's some guy who's the assistant manager of the mailroom and that's an incredibly status filled position for that guy and there's some other guy who's number two in the company who was just passed over to be number one and the only pertinent thing in his mind is not the 99 thousand employees and he's higher ranking and that there's still somebody ahead of me and he would see the same thing in baboons in other words it's not being poor it's feeling poor the next critical piece in the story is work from the sky Richard Wilkinson in the UK who shows what's the best most like effective way to make somebody feel poor independent of their absolute levels of income surround them by inequality surround them by reminders of all the people who are doing better than that I mean this is where social media it's the amplifier - all amplifiers of this right is you you can't go ten minutes if you're on it without looking at somebody who's obviously better-looking obviously smarter obviously richer obviously having more fun I think this has been pretty well documented writing lifestyle of the rich and famous or you could be driving down a freeway and somebody passes you and I don't know what counts as a high status car these days that costs a fortune but they come speeding past you and you can feel crappy and diminished and like a less successful human and you never even saw that person's face this is unheard of in the history of humans or a primate of being able to feel socially subordinated and you don't even interact with the person Oh there's people out there with you know at least if the next door neighbor has more camels than you that's a very like tangible real thing in terms of like likelihood of surviving that extract income inequality explains the mediating effect between objective socioeconomic status subjective socioeconomic status and health outcome what I'm hearing you also say though that's a more subtle spin on this is it's not necessarily global income inequality it's local income inequality that is much bigger but what technology is allowed us to do it makes the little bounces that's right that's exactly right it's expanded what local means you can sit there and watch

[01:13:44] I don't know lifestyles of the rich and famous and back when you would never have gotten into like the petty or fiefdoms castle or wood and now you can see all the crap they have that you're never going again and feel less loved as a result it's so interesting to hear you talk about this this is a topic that I think anybody listening to this is well aware of especially if you're a parent because you also have to think about this through a developmental lens which is at least when you and I grew up I didn't grow up with a lot but you really had no idea what was different right like you simply everybody was the same I mean everybody's parents bought used cars and set of new cars and everybody had more or less the same sort of you know clothing that wasn't exactly the best and and whatever so at least you could argue well where we at least spared some of this difficulty during a critical window of development and what happens now to a ten-year-old that's got a smartphone and is subjected to this because I remember that funny show lifestyles of the rich and famous I can still sort of hear the goofy cheesy theme song I think I even probably watched it once or twice as a kid but it's a lot easier when that's the one exposure you have to extreme wealth or disparity and either you can watch it for one hour or not but it's quite a different thing if not to pick on the

[01:15:11] Kardashians I'm just but if you're inundated with oh my god quit look at how awesome the card ian's are and what they're doing and how great their life is and multiply that by three log orders do we have any data that suggests that we are at a critical juncture because I was having this discussion with a friend yesterday which is is there evidence of any greater transition in technology in both a positive and negative way than this generation to the last is this truly the greatest step forward I would assume so but the things we worry about people have been worrying about for centuries oh my kids they don't go outside they don't play they don't have like meaningful relationships because they spend all their time talking on the telephone they spend all their time listening to their transistor radio so maybe we're blowing this up maybe this is just this generation's version I mean

[01:16:12] I guess the one difference is when you're talking on the telephone when you're listening to the transistor radio I don't know if it creates that global to local phenomenon quite as easily or as quickly or with less resistance as we see but maybe you're right maybe this has always been one generations struggle with the last but what you get is an amplifier now because if you're an insecure socially isolated Perry adolescent kid who's vulnerable in all sorts of ways and you know no matter what decade or century it was you're the last one picked for the game you're the one who least popular or whatever and that has all its corrosive effects now if you really set your mind to it and you're that kid you could spend 24/7 just wallowing toxically in evidence of a gazillion other people who are better looking than you and more popular and invited to parties you'll never be in it amplifies further and the technology does absolutely that what I think it does is it makes the vulnerable more damaged than in the past I think it's safe to say these amplifiers aren't going where so rather than wallow in their harm I guess the more relevant question is what do we do if you're a parent today or not a parent today and you're thinking about this through the lens of yourself versus your kids whatever what are the steps that one can take to become less susceptible to these forces that seem to drive this because I want to step back for a moment when I think about these areas that we've talked about before about the impact of nutrition and sleep and exercise and stress or distress to make it more the term I use when I think about this personally the one I'm most worried about is the last one I think I've got a pretty good handle on nutrition and it's in many ways easier to control I feel like I'm more in control of what I eat and when I make bad choices I'm usually doing them consciously like I decided

[01:18:26] I'm gonna eat this pizza versus I can't help myself I'm gonna eat this pizza similarly with exercise like and again I'm not saying this for anybody else but me this is just my personal thing and even with sleep like once you commit to it which is not something I did until probably seven or eight years ago that I sort of committed to wow this really matters and to forego this thing bad idea it's this last one that really drives me crazy which of course doesn't help matters because the fact that it drives you crazy makes it worse but I'll give you an example as a general rule outside of the immediate postprandial period of a high glucose meal far and away my highest blood glucose is always in the morning now I wear a 24-hour glucose meter so kind of a weird guy for almost four years I've been wearing a glucose monitor all the time so it measures my glucose 24/7 at one minute increments and out of say 365 days in the year I'm easily wearing it 330 days of the year so I've got a lot of data and without a question when you look at a 24-hour period if you stripped away the x-axis of time

[01:19:36] I could easily identify morning for you without exception I'll give you an example this is not something I'd plan to do I had breakfast yesterday yesterday being Sunday really early because I woke up with my kids made breakfast I normally don't eat breakfast but I did so had a breakfast 7:30 in the morning did a workout had to catch a flight didn't have time to eat after it had a very very busy day didn't eat a single thing got to the hotel around 10:30 or 11:00 didn't want to eat so didn't you know got up this morning it's been almost 24 hours since a meal and I looked at my glucose meter and it was like said you know 110 110 millions but I was like there's no way that's right calibrated it sure enough it was 110 now there is no earthly reason I should have had a glucose of a hundred and ten milligrams per deciliter 24 hours after my last meal which by the way was bacon and eggs it's not like I was eating pancakes right well I promise you if I could spot check my cortisol it was high and here's the thing before I went to bed my glucose was quite low you know my glucose was probably 80 when I went to bed and it slowly rose and sure enough as my day wore on today the glucose went lower lower lower lower lower it was about 78 before you walked in here I'm not alone by the way so I've seen this a lot clinically with patients once you start putting these 24-hour glucose sensors on people which a lot of my patients are now doing you get this insight into this horrible thing that's happening when we think we're sleeping and nothing else is going on but we're ruminating or God knows what else and fits perfectly with morning wakening is when you get your highest glucocorticoid levels which is probably one of the main driving forces on the increased blood glucose flow and when you think about it from a circadian standpoint what's the most challenging thing you have to do each day in the absence of any major tumult get up start functioning all of those it just seems like it's disproportionate certainly the dawn effect has been well described it's more amplified in people with type 2 diabetes which is another interesting point right which is why is it that someone who already has glucose dysregulation would have any higher cortisol response in the morning and yet you'll see you know enormous fluctuations in glucose yes my point here is this seems like a harder problem to fix and certainly meditation is by far the best tool I have ever found to even approximate getting this under control but it's still hard because it's not like you have a pill if your blood pressure is high well I think it's probably best to fix it in any way possible but we also have really great drugs that fix high blood pressure that can at least mask these things we don't have a pill to fix hypercortisolism of endocrine situations and yet as you've described eloquently it's also so innately wired into us and we have this miserable midbrain that's just killing us first what I'd love to hear your thoughts on meditation but then also other things that given how much time you've spent thinking about this problem I'd love to know how you would suggest someone who doesn't have quite the Zen mindset that I can tell you do what should someone else be thinking right off the bat I'm delighted to see that I have a persona of a Zen

[01:23:05] I'm actually like one of the most high paced rest people you're ever gonna run across I've spent 40 years professionally studying how bad the outcome is gonna be of all of these like bad lifestyle aspects without having anything insightful to say about how to actually fix it or or prevent it and I certainly have learned personally absolutely nothing from my lifetime of work I'm like incredibly stressed I'm mostly good at telling you what's gonna happen if you don't get stuff under control rather than how to get things under control when I look at the stress management literature I don't do it very often because I tend to get sort of agitated at that point but broadly it works it works as in you can lower blood pressure you can lower cholesterol levels you can lowest objective sense of healthy subjective measures as well with all sorts of interventions what do you see when you look at the literature closely first off is you can't do yours management on the weekends kind of thing it needs to be a regular sort of thing you can't do it while you're on hold on the phone for 30 seconds you need to set time out for it you know the benefits of aerobic exercise I don't know what the magic number is these days but 20 or 30 minute blocks is a minimum to start getting the cardiovascular benefits so it's got to be something like you stop things to do so that's important let's double click on that what you're basically saying is because I think you're understating how much you know about this topic obviously it's something you know a lot about as seriously as we would take nutrition and if you think about how many hours a week do you put into eating I mean even if you're shoveling food down your throat it still takes quite a bit of time if you're going to exercise to the levels that have demonstrated benefit we're talking about hours a week not minutes a week if you're going to make the difference between getting by on sleep versus getting restorative sleep I'm not talking about the absolute amount of sleep I'm just talking about the Delta between those two think about how many hours that is in fact for the average

[01:25:14] American that would work out to be about an extra seven to eight hours a week of sleep and what you're basically saying is if you want to combat this hypercortisolism it ain't a 20-minute a week thing and in some ways that's halves into one of the 80/20 rules of sort of mental health professionals okay so you have this crazy stressful lifestyle and there's just a bazillion things you can't say no to and you're just going 24/7 and if you've gotten to the point of saying this is crazy this is not a quality life

[01:25:50] I want to live a healthy quality old age well I got to get this stuff under control I'm gonna start doing something stress management to you and if you've gotten to the point where in this lifestyle where there's a billion things you can't say no to each day you're saying no to them enough that nonetheless 20 minutes every single day you are doing this it almost doesn't matter what intervention you're doing you're 80% of the way there already if you're managing to do that and that's very similar to this sort of amazed classic funding you get people who were clinically depressed and finally finally finally they're good to do something about it and merely making a first appointment even before you've seen the person people feel significantly better because you are finally saying I matter enough to do something about this or I'm activated enough or I'm optimistic enough to actually go you're halfway there at that point merely by doing something on a near-daily basis so just on that logic even though I don't know that this has been done you would argue that ten minutes of deliberate mindful practice of meditation daily would probably be better than one hour once a week absolutely in part because if nothing else if you do it daily seven times a week you were sitting in the aftermath of having done that versus only one time a week and an awful lot of what's most interesting about physiology and its impact on sort of mental health things like that is what's happening in the recovery period after something like that in the same way one awful hour-long stressor a week reverses punctuated episodes of it throughout the week without question the latter is worse because you've now got umpteen different times that you have to recover from having turned on the stress response and that's where a lot of the damage occurs you know I learned something about myself that's you know sounds so stupid because it's so obvious although I don't think it's true for everybody email is a huge stress to me to be blunt I hate it that would be the kindest thing I could say about email I really a few months ago hit a true nadir in my response and

[01:28:07] I'm like looking at these glucose levels going up and I'm looking at these morning glucose levels so even though my overall glucose level still look great I mean this trend was upsetting to me I'm watching my resting heart rate in the morning go up over the course of four months it had gone up like six beats per minute and if anything I was in better shape exercising more regularly

[01:28:28] I made this observation one day which is how many times in a day do I stop to look at email even if it's just to check - and the answer was like 50 and every time I do it to your point even if it's very brief the after effect is not that brief he said I could I could look at an email and see to stressful things but it might sit with me for 20 minutes so I tried this experiment which is I'm gonna just check email twice a day - 30 minute blocks of email and I would say within two weeks I just really felt better it seems to me like we just have to figure out ways to figure out what those triggers are for us individual is probably some people for whom email doesn't trigger them at all right there's probably you know for me Twitter doesn't trigger anything because hey I have a very narrow window that I pay attention to and it doesn't involve things that are aggravating like politics or religion or whatever it just sort of I'm only really following science so anytime I look at Twitter I'm actually learning something kind of new and there but I'm sure there are many people listening this who would say oh my god everything if I spend an hour on

[01:29:40] Twitter my blood pressure could be through the roof so it's like everyone's gotta kind of pick their thing you said you're type-a which obviously you are mean you know what I didn't say at the outset I'm starts being but you've won one of the most prestigious awards imaginable which is the MacArthur award and what you want that about 30 years ago right that's impressive they don't give that award out lightly so that's the one that's referred to as the genius award and I know you're probably like your skin is crawling when I say that my point being is you're an incredibly accomplished successful guy it's not surprising you would describe yourself as a type a what have you learned about yourself over the past thirty years or even longer going back to your first days in Kenya about what those triggers are for you and what you can do to lower your cortisol levels not surprisingly if you you hang out with people who were field biologists of any sort and again

[01:30:30] I've only been a part-time annual one over the decades but nonetheless still think of myself as a field while it just we're kind of a solitary tribe in during my peak periods of doing field work I was spending three four months a year alone living a tent where 12 hours a day I wouldn't say a word to another person temperamentally this is kind of who I've been for a long time and there was always this ironic thing because I was sitting there studying these baboons because primate social behavior and I'm interested in primates social behavior and this big sort of PIFAN II I had in my work that okay here are your social rank as a baboon has something to do with your health but much more importantly is your patterns of socialization and social networks and how often do you groom and how often to somebody groom you and how often do you sit in a contact with another baboon or plane with an infant and then I you know finished the day's work and go back to my tent so there was something ironic that I was like studying the health benefits of sociality living alone in a tent a large part of the year your wife is a scientist too isn't she she was she kind of decided she was sick of it and she now directs a musical theater program which is much more fulfilling for her but at one point my wife came along yeah yeah that's what was gonna happen and eventually family and do you know kind of realizing oh I've missed out on an awful lot of water really like the wonderful worth living for moments and life out of the sociality stuff and that is a refuge and a sanctuary from the world's madness and I could not have predicted as a 20 year old who had been planning to be a field biologist for a dozen years at that point I could not have predicted sort of how much of my equilibrium at this point turns out to be due to interacting with the right two or three other primates like being in love with them and stuff that one was kind of a revelation for me I am NOT the social being that I would have guessed I would have been back when just interesting because having this discussion with you today

[01:32:51] I can sense much more of your introversion then the first time we met when you were giving an unbelievably charismatic and a maded talk and i don't know how many of us were there maybe a hundred people and which is so interesting right because you would I think anybody sitting in the audience would look at this and say oh that's it that's the life of the party but it's interesting that we can compartmentalize and separate those things right I mean you couldn't get up there and you can do what you need to do and you're at your happiest I'm guessing in the way you described it versus in the aftermath of that talk when a hundred people run up to you to ask you four questions each not to get to self-reflective or something but I'm a fairly introverted person who does better with scripts and giving a lecture is a pretty structured script and having sort of an academic persona or whatever is a another version of it as well what year did you become a full professor at

[01:33:45] Stanford it was 33 or something really 90s I mean you live in San Francisco so you're not making that commute every day I hope nope but I did for about a quarter century yeah that'll that'll hurt the cortisol levels won't it I used the commuter train Cal train here so you could read this was much of it was before cellphones so you'd take it up at 4th and King and you just go yeah

[01:34:11] I used to make that ride all the ice have a girlfriend that lived in San Francisco and I loved that train ride and then you get off on your bike at 4th and King and you could go anywhere in the city exactly I wrote half my book writing was on the train there it's pretty weird when you realize that like one of your valid social communities or the conductors on Cal trains or as you're watching him grow up on you and things like that but ya know that was I was a big fan of train commuting so speaking about books let's talk about your more recent book it's about human behavior which you know I mean I can see based on this discussion now how your interest would shift to that what was the impetus for that research well title is behave the biology of humans at her best and worst and as soon as we were talking about before I closed my lab four years ago and stopped active research to sit for four years and write in this book and it's basically trying to make sense of the biology of what is for me the most puzzling thing about us as a behaving species which is we are simultaneously the most miserably violent species on earth and the most altruistic and cooperative and empathic and any given human is capable depending on the setting of incredible gyrations as to whether they are being wonderful or awful or in between or behaviors aware whether that counts as good or bad is incredibly dependent on what culture they happen to be doing it in just trying to make sense of the biology I mean it's totally boring biology is to like how your brain makes you do something like pull a trigger like which muscle groups have been told me like that's that's like studying cockroach neurobiology what's totally interesting is the fact that we're a species were sometimes pulling a trigger can be one of the most awful things a human can do and sometimes it could be one of the most wondrous ones if you're suicidally drawing fire from innocent people and you're sacrificing yourself for in one setting you put your hand on somebody else's and that could be a moment of incredible compassion or in another moment you do the exact same thing with your primate muscles and that's the first step of betraying a loved one of just making sense of this contextual stuff about human behavior which is hugely complicated and the song and dance that I go through and nearly eight hundred izing pages in the book is you're gonna understand nothing about that if you've concluded aha we now know this is the part of the brain that explains everything or this is the neurotransmitter or the hormone or the gene or the childhood instead to make sense of human behavior you got a factor in what your neurons did one second ago but you got a factor in the environmental triggers of that thirty seconds ago and you got a factor in what your hormone levels were like this morning and what neuroplasticity you've done over the last two seasons and what your adolescence was like in your childhood your fetal life in your genes and amazingly what sort of culture were your ancestors inventing centuries ago because that influenced the way you were raised within minutes of birth and what things you value and what things your amygdala does or doesn't respond to and all the think of that what sort of ecosystems produce different types of cultures and then finally evolution and why we're in some ways like chimps and in some ways like bonobos but we're not chimps we're not bonobos we've solved our own special evolutionary if you're gonna understand the stuff it's everything from one second before to 100 million years before and all these levels interact and it's complicated as hell when people ask the question which I'm sure you've heard this a hundred times and you hear people asking all the time are we innately good or bad that question doesn't really permit the level of nuance you're describing the answer is yes yes exactly and what's most startling about us is most of us have the capacity to do something that we would be stunned and sickened that we were capable of doing it and most of us are capable of in some circumstance of doing something that is so damn heroic and most of us spending most of our time doing things that instead are ambiguous and multi-layered and full of ulterior motives and what's really going on there and you look at the worst of us and the best of us and there's not a whole lot of really reliable predictors beforehand and how much of this like you know you wrote a little bit about PMS so when I think about PMS I think about it purely through the lens of the endocrine system right I think of it purely through the lens of when a woman is in her luteal phase that progesterone level has to rise for the placenta and then of course virtually every time it's a false alarm you don't need it you shed that lining and that progesterone level comes crash down and it's this crashing down a progesterone that has always interested me why two women could experience the same we can measure progesterone levels throughout the cycle and we could know that at day twenty-two two women could have the exact same progesterone and on the first day of their menses they could have the same progesterone so you know they had the same peak to Valley and yet two women can experience that in two totally different ways now I've thought about that through the lens of progesterone receptors and you know the way we sort of talked about the cortisol stuff is there something else to that that you layer on top of that that is even more subtle about those differences yeah tons of this sort of additional insights here's one example that comes completely out of left field and this was actually my wife's thesis research on baboons so your female baboon and you're coming up on your period and we could frame it as you just did here's two two females who are both about to have their period a of the same exact progesterone levels and as soon as they start menstruating progesterone drops the exact same way and one of them is a totally irritable awful liking jerk to all the other females around her for three days afterward and the other one is not the other one withdraws and become socially isolated okay what's the difference it sure can't be progesterone levels and it's probably not going to be progesterone receptor levels it's one of them's high ranking she could afford to be a jerk to everybody else and get away with it the other one's low ranking oh it's not just your hormone levels it's what sort of position in your society you have even if you're a baboon or now you look at humans and depending on what sort of culture you're in are you in an individualist culture or a collectivist one individualist the

[01:41:30] United States poster child of individualist thinking collectivist 99% of the research has been done on East Asian cultures and how you some at aside your mood shifts and your physical shifts during your period differs in collectivist versus individualist cultures how irritable you become not because there's a difference in how much of negative effect you're feeling during the time are you in a culture where it's culturally acceptable to and moan to all your best friends when you're not feeling well or are you in a culture or when you're feeling lousy what you're supposed to do is reach out affiliative leAndria fie you're like social values and how much of that do you think is also genetic so for example I mean even though I'm not a gynecologist and therefore don't see a lot of this I see enough to realize that women will often say my sister and my mother either go through or went through the same feelings and of course as you described there are so many different variants the stereotypical one is that you know the sort of the nasty phenotype but actually the one that I think might be more prevalent is the sadder phenotype the more emotionally distraught just emotionally labile but in a non aggressive way that's probably the phenotype I see more easier to cry or something like that so how much of that do you think is heritable in the way that I color or some other aspect of body habitus or even depression is quite heritable versus the ecosystem you're in purely environmental well the answer is you really can't use one of the other blahblah but if you could only manipulate one which would be the first one and I'm definitely of the school of genes get overrated in terms of their impact and you know a gene affecting your eye color it's okay to use words like determine and it's probably not even though I'm percent accurate but when you get to genetic influences on all the interesting stuff and behavior and our internalize and all of that yeah genes are important but overwhelmingly these are genes that modify ulnar ability vulnerability to certain types of environments okay so for example you bring up depression and catastrophic pandemic of that and you know there's a whole shopping list by now of genes that have been implicated and probably the single most important one it's called the gene for the serotonin transporter and serotonin

[01:44:12] SSRIs Prozac all of those serotonin is just like we're right in the middle of what we understand about the neuro chemistry in the depression and it turns out this serotonin transporter gene comes in a few different flavors a few different genetic variants and a ton of basic research rats monkeys etc suggested that if you had one particular variant you were more at risk for major depression okay so this classic work this guy had to coughs um Cosby you sort of a God in the field goes out and he follows like seventeen thousand people from birth up to age 25 or so he's got genetic information of them and he's able to ask this critical question okay if you have the quote bad version of this gene by age 25 are you more likely they have a history of clinical depression what's the prevalence of the gene approximately it depends on the population in his population his was a mixed one but westernized Western urine populations I think it's got about a twenty percent incidence so the question then is of those twenty percent how many go on to get depressed of the eighty percent how many go on to get depressed the answer is very likely going to be it's not a one-to-one mapping it might be an increase in risk by some factor and what they saw was overall there was no increase in risk having the bad variant however if it was coupled with a lot of childhood stress you had about a twenty fold increase in the risk so just to be clear on aggregate there was no difference the hazard ratio is one for with gene verses without because of the ton of variability but if you wanted to amplify it take that gene and expose it to childhood stress or trauma and you almost assure depression you get a massive boost in predictability look at people without the scare and vulnerability variant and look at the same severity of childhood stressors and loss and you got a moderate increase and incidence of depression these folks massive order of magnitude multiples of that more increase there what that tells you is this is a gene whose variants alter how readily you deal with experiential kicks in the ass is growing up and it turns out these different variants are regulated in different ways by glucocorticoid Soha so there's a stress angle all of that the same way there's another change the people were interested in the genetics of aggression this gene model would mean oxidase and it comes in variants and that's and there's a class of drugs that targets these yup receptors you know again a ton of basic research had suggested ooh there's a scary variant of it which if you have it you are good at more be more predisposed towards violence and in fact the same group working with the same population massive data set lines of showing just having that variant doesn't get you a higher risk of antisocial violent behavior by age 25 if and only if it was coupled with abuse childhood abuse growing up oh if you didn't have the scary variant childhood abuse a little bit of an increased risk have this variant with the abuse and it was virtually the same figure as with the serotonin transporter gene huge boost there over and over the genes that are interesting when it comes to this stuff these are all genes about vulnerability and potentialities and tendencies that are emerging only in certain environments and not and others they're the factors are inseparable it makes me think of the apoE genotype which is linked to Alzheimer's disease and there we see that there is a difference about 25% of the population carries at least one copy of that gene and they represent about two-thirds of the cases of

[01:48:10] Alzheimer's disease it's not a deterministic gene but it does increase risk now of course you could argue that maybe in a decade or more we will be able to say something very similar about apoE which is not remotely deterministic it only gets turned on when XY and Z happen before this period of time or in absolute and of course we don't know what those things are right now at least in the examples you gave you could say well trauma or childhood you know some event in try and childhood was was the trigger and if you're seeing a 20-fold difference it's pretty clear that you found the trigger nonetheless there's still variability to explain after that but yeah it's pathetically that counts as virtually state of the art for understanding the modifying factors and it's it's gonna be that way in any time you do these like gee wasps massive fishing expeditions and you come out with 300 genes are implicated in a trait that's as boring as height 300 genes which you put together all of your knowledge of the variation of them and any given individual and you have like 4% predictability of their height you know Christ if you're talking about genes for propensity towards feeling poignancy or James were like anything that's interesting yeah this is not chances even if you just limit yourself to diseases you know of the 20,000 genes in our body you can really only point to about a hundred that are directly this mutation means this disease and they're all pretty esoteric right it's all like inborn errors of metabolism and certain things like that but when you start to talk about the complex diseases like

[01:50:00] Alzheimer's disease even this predictive as the apoe4 is it's not even close to being enough to understand it and and I think yeah it's funny when you talk about it through that lens you realize the importance of environment which is you know the risk of stating the obvious you said something a while ago that I made a note of because I wanted to come back to it you talked about the effect of glucocorticoids on the hippocampus and not only how harmful it was for memory consolidation but overall cognitive impairment and listen to you talk about that was exactly the way

[01:50:30] Matthew Walker at Berkeley speaks about sleep deprivation and it's impact on the hippocampus which then makes me wonder I assume it's been well studied that you know when people are sleep-deprived we see greater elevations of cortisol you have a sense of what the evolutionary basis of that is because it seems counterintuitive we eat you would think even evolution would want that to be in the opposite direction I mean the only explanation I can come up with is if you're sleep deprived you're assuming that there's a reason for it that's good and therefore you want that of course not with anything the fact the higher cortisol will then I think that's probably the best sort of piece of teleology for that yeah if you're like a basic mammal which means either you are emphatically diurnal or emphatically nocturnal and if instead you're wide awake eight hours into what should be the twelve oh this does not happen by chance the odds are you have something stressful going on I think that's the logic of it turns out the stress sleep sleep quality cortisol cluster of interactions even more subtle incredibly cool study this was a science paper some years back that okay so as we talked about this circadian peak of glucocorticoids or around the time you wake up what's interesting is about an hour before you wake up levels begin to rise telling you something a subtle point which is a lot of glucocorticoid actions are not for dealing with a stressor that has already commenced but can be preparatory so the preparatory stressor is having to actually get up and get out of bed and start functioning you addressed in an hour before people wake spontaneously glucocorticoid levels are elevating now in the study what you do is you take a whole bunch of volunteers we're sleeping and you see the preparatory rise all of that and you tell them tonight we're doing something different I'm gonna wake you up at 4:00 in the morning and what you see is around 3 o'clock glucocorticoid levels start rising okay now you do something even more interesting you say okay tonight I'm not going to tell you when but I'm gonna wake you up at some point during the night and that's the end of your night's sleep and the person is about ninety minutes into their sleep stage and all of that and cortisol rises and stays high for the rest of the night you get one sleep cycle and then the adrenal gland says that's it I'm on ready-alert yeah exactly so not only is it bad not to get enough sleep not only is it bad if the insufficient sleep is fragmented but the worst is if it's fragmented unpredictably and that's like every medical resident in history it's the first thought I had actually when you said that which was every night of call you have this pager and you're in this call room and you just want so desperately to sleep for an hour two hours three hours I remember as my residency went on the degree of sleep deprivation got greater and greater that the steps I had to take to ensure I wouldn't sleep through a page got greater and greater and I'm not making this up I don't think I've ever told the story before it's so ridiculous I used to use this really heavy paper tape and tape the pager to my head my forehead at full volume because you would get both the sound to your ear and then you'd get the transmission you know through the bone but imagine laying in bed with tape wrapped around your head holding a pager on your forehead in anticipation of what's coming not knowing when it's coming it could be in five minutes or it could be in two hours you know you're gonna wake up yeah I'm guessing that wasn't great sleep no it's like wildly destructive and what do you know it turns out if you have elevated glue corticoid levels while you're asleep you have less delta sleep time which is the restorative stuff you make less adenosine stores in your brain during so even if you manage to go to sleep if it's under the eye could be asleep for two hours now or thirty seconds the sleep quality is gonna be horrible this interplay becomes more pronounced what about cancer what role do you think stress plays in cancer and do you think it's mostly mediated through the immune system I mean cortisol can be quite damaging yeah hugely hugely controversial subject there is a common perception that stress can play a very substantial role in the onset of cancer in coming out of remission and rates of tumor growth and such sufficiently so that there's been all sorts of studies where you ask cancer patients what do you think is the cause of your cancer and stress is invariably way up there the actual evidence for a role of stress in causing cancer bringing it out of remission accelerating tumor growth is very very minimal there's been a remarkably small number of good prospective studies of humans that have really truly ruled out all the confounding factors when you look at the animal studies what they typically involve is you experimentally induce a tumor you inject transformed cells you give a carcinogen some such thing my lab back when did some of that work under those circumstances you can accelerate the growth of a tumor but those are circumstances of cancer acquisition that are virtually irrelevant to human cancer and the other question is can you do it without perturbing other things so for example if you go ahead and stick the tumor into the mouse and apply a stress to it it seems that that by definition will alter some other parameter what it eats how much it sleeps the quality of its sleep so it becomes difficult to disentangle cortisol I mean I guess the only thing I can think of is what does the experiment look like where you take the mouse that experimentally has the tumor and you just start injecting more glucocorticoid so in other words you don't actually increase the stress level you just increase the readout state of stress you accelerate the tumor growth we did one study showing that as soon as cells become transformed they up regulate the glute for glucose transporter and that's the one that's further up regulated by glucocorticoids and target cells so you're just shoveling energy over those cells yeah rajee's are eventually consumed glucose anyway just given the number of them followed by the Warburg effect so to me even though that's very mechanistic and artificial that that strikes me is pretty reasonable evidence that cortisol can play a role in answer I mean I guess it's gonna be much more difficult to disentangle that in the real world yep and again these are types of cancers where this was virally induced transformation of cells that are then transplanted in very artificial systems that turn out not to be terribly applicable to human cancers and what you wind up seeing then okay yes glucocorticoids can be potently immunosuppressive usually by the time you have a tumor growing that's long past the point where it's an immunological problem it's now can you keep the tumor from growing a whole bunch of capillaries that will feed it can you keep it from stealing all sorts of energy can you keep it from turning off cell death programs it's no longer in the immune realm so it seems that there'd be hard to make the case that acute bouts of stress can really have any impact because you know yes sure you can acutely disrupt the immune system and maybe get sick right that you know I could explain why you might get a cold under a period of great stress but not necessarily cancer and what that ones meaning is that should be a massive massive take-home message for anyone who is predisposed towards thinking ooh stress caused my cancer too bad I didn't have better priorities in life now I know whose fault it is that sort of thing and it should certainly make you damn cautious if there's some highly credentialed quack out there who is selling a stress management will stop your tumor will make it disappear entirely and watch your wallet at that point all that being said there's been some wonderful work and a lot of this was pioneered by a Stanford colleague of mine David Spiegel who showed that things like supportive group therapy among cancer patients enhances survival so what do you think is the mechanism of that ok this was when he first published this in the late 80s this was front-page news I remember this I don't remember when it was published but I remember learning about it in medical asset finding and one is immediately tempted to released as a biology type like me too with a biological explanation along the lines of what you proposed okay supportive group therapy you're less stressed so you don't secrete as many glucocorticoids and therefore you're not having those adverse effects of it on your immune systems that are able to fight that you live longer Trello is lower glucose levels and lower glucose and lower insulin and lower IGF you could yeah you could come up with a complete biological and in general those studies have shown that pathway does not occur spiegel and i did some of those studies things so what's actually going on something which if you're a nuts-and-bolts reductive bio type person is terribly disappointing but is so interesting and important people when they have supportive cancer therapy with other people going through the same hell they become more compliant when their medical regimes they're more likely to go the extra round of chemo because everybody else is cheering them on saying i didn't want to do it either and they're more likely to take the meds that make them nauseous as hell have you eaten today me neither we're gonna eat right after we're done with the group have you taken your meds you're gonna take them right now people become more compliant and that was very hard to demonstrate because what cancer patient ever wants to admit to a researcher actually I skip about a third of my meds because they make me feel so damn sick they're saving your life Witter it's in some ways a dark dirty secret in cancer therapeutics how much people diverge from their optimal treatment regime because the treatment regimes are sheer utter hell when you're surrounded by people who are going through the same thing and understand you're more likely to be compliant I think that winds up explaining an awful lot of that effect so when you look at cancer atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disease it seems to me that the direct lines of evidence for the damage of hypercortisolism stress response are probably most demonstrated in cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis visa vie several mechanisms not the least of which is hypertension both macro and micro vasculature but also through endothelial disruption adhesion of cells and sludging you know it's the best understood realm cancer is probably the weakest realm I would expect that it's playing a role in dementia but again this probably gets to the layer of susceptibility right there's probably an isolation maybe this wouldn't play a role but in combination with other factors it would and it seems that for example we know that cortisol inhibits melatonin secretion so even if you take two people who have the same amount of blue light reduction which should therefore stimulate melatonin the one with hypercortisolism we actually measure this right we can measure overnight urinary cortisol and overnight urinary melatonin you can see this association quite strongly well melatonin it's a pro neurogenic molecule so having less of that is less restorative to the brain even beyond its important role which is sort of removing the brakes on being awake so what other lines of evidence do you see beyond what you've already described at the developmental stage now later in life basically everything we talked about with the hippocampus applies in the adult brain as well and it's the first place we tend to see changes and it was the first area of researched first evidence for stress damaging the hippocampus and McCampbell dependent memory type stuff late 70s I mean that was really the first domain and superb studies from a number of groups and I had my two cents and that would return also showing you could accelerate aspects of hippocampal aging with lots of stress lots of glue corticoids extent of neuron law sixth sense a memory problem extensive reactive gliosis etcetera etc next big outpost that people began to appreciate in adult brains was derivative of what we talked about before which was the amygdala I was just about to say is there a direct correlation I guess between amygdala size and dementia what you see instead is that the syndrome where its most demonstrated as peach you see expansion of the amygdala and you see atrophy of the hippocampus and glucocorticoids probably play the driving role in both so in the amygdala like the hippocampal story is stress and glucocorticoids screw it up neurons don't work as well networks don't work as well the overall size decreases you in atrophy and the amygdala it's the exact opposite story neurons work better than they should neurons become more excitable form denser networks the amygdala gets bigger what's that about the problem with chronic stress is your memory goes down the tubes hippocampus isn't working as well as usual the problem with chronic stress and the amygdala is it works better than it's supposed to and this is the link between stress and anxiety disorders stress and fear stress and all of that next sort of outpost that people started looking at was the dopamine system in the brain and dopamine neurotransmitter most famously associated with reward pleasure cocaine works on the dopamine system a much more accurate subtle picture of it is dopamine is actually more about the anticipation of pleasure than it is about pleasure itself and about goal directed behavior you're willing to do in anticipation of reward but then a whole literature showing what distress in blue corticoids do there they mess with the dopamine system it's less clean of a story than a make the lower hippocampus but in ways that predispose towards the two big psychiatric diseases of screwed up dopamine systems number one addiction more vulnerability to addiction harder to get off of addictive substances number two depression depression is a disease on a certain level dopamine depletion it's a disease of inability to feel pleasure and hadou

[02:05:45] Nia and that's the neuro chemistry of the link between chronic stress and why that increases a likelihood of the first three four episodes of major depression what for me is the most exciting area is one where if I was starting over you know forget the hippocampus who cares about like how many digits you could remember backwards or whatever the most interesting domain is turning out to be what's tereska glucocorticoids to to the frontal cortex judgment impulse control executive function long term planning strategizing and it turns out virtually every bad thing cellularly that stress include corticoids doing the hippocampus there turning out to do the frontal cortex as well and what does that begin to explain in this entire world of why it is during moments of extreme emotional arousal especially aversive ones why we make terrible terrible decisions that seem brilliant at the time and you spend the rest of your life regretting it because impulse control your amygdala overpowers your frontal cortex at those times your amygdala has a lot more talking to your motor systems than your frontal cortex does it's the reason why judgments and impulse control become terrible when we're frazzled it's also looking like as a side story with that it's one of the reasons why when we're very stressed it's hard for the frontal cortex to do one of its harder jobs which is to take the view the world from somebody else's perspective empathy empathy exactly some research on animal models of empathy and this was work with his client McGill named Geoffrey mogul and we're by collaborated with him showing in both rats and humans you're a less empathic toward strangers when they're in pain and if you block glucocorticoid release you don't get that effect anymore glucocorticoids the stressful nosov dealing with scary novel humans or scary novel mice if you're a rodent glucocorticoids narrow your window as to who counts as an us and whose pain registers and things of that sort so for me you know it's incredibly interesting if you're stressed and suddenly your SAT scores plummet the fact that stress makes we'll crappier to each other and less empathic and more parochial and more xenophobic and more impulsive with the worst of our impulses that's the stuff that really interests me these days everything you just said Robert is almost a call to action in criminal justice reform and I've done a podcast on this topic where you know it was very fortunate to go into a maximum-security prison with a program that is really there to do incredible rehabilitative work led by this woman named Katherine

[02:08:46] Hoch it's a humbling experience there's a game that we played about halfway through the day called step to the line this is a game that's used to basically identify the vast difference between those of us who are volunteers like in other words the role of luck in our lives versus the gentleman who 2/3 of these men are never going to get out of prison one man had even spent more than half his life in solitary confinement his total life so it starts with these questions of step to the line if you grew up in a home that had two parents and you know of the volunteers you know 60% step of the line of the inmates five step to the line right step to the line if you grew up in a home where there were more than four books you can imagine the disparity step for the line if you saw someone die with your own eyes before this aged up I mean and it's it's a very emotional thing to go through because as this game is unfolding you're just you're feeling more and more fortunate on the one hand because you realize if not for the the grace of this luck and at the same time the empathy you have for these men who have done the most heinous things grows and you start to realize boy there's a fine line between those of us on the inside those of us on the outside because everything you've said really resonated when I was thinking about some of the stories the men told us about the decisions that they made and there's this one part of the exercise that's incredibly emotional where you're partnered with one one guy so it's it's one volunteer one inmate and you were each telling the other person the greatest regret of your life the biggest mistake you've made and hearing some of these stories it's not to justify anything that's been done and it's not to say that there shouldn't be consequences for it but a lot of these things that people have wound up in prison for are really impulsive horrible decisions as opposed to decades of sinister planning like it's one thing to look at what you know like Hitler did it's hard to argue that anything that he did that was bad was impulsive it's quite another thing when you look at someone in a gang-related incident where you know this guy gets shot and you're gonna shoot this guy back or this guy's about to shoot you and you shoot him I mean and yet that type of drug-related violence is disproportionately represented in certainly in the US penal system and then to build on what you said it's not clear that the environment in there is reducing cortisol levels to the level that would enable rehabilitation which is really the thesis of and a lot of people I'm sure listening to this or thinking why would you feel empathy for these folks that are in there and why should society care about them but the reality of it is if they're going to get out you should care that says nothing of maybe the higher level that you should care which is the injustice of it but even if you took a purely selfish view a non-trivial number of these men and women are going to get out so wouldn't you rather they get out and function better and yet it's really tragic to see this and I know two people actually very well who spent a great deal of time in prison one of whom I interviewed on this podcast his name's Cory McCarthy and it really strikes me as the exception and not the rule that people are able to emerge from that environment then go on to be successful outside it's a system that is so so broken any study the last century and a half's worth of the neurobiology and genetics and child development and all of that and the notion that we are free agents of our action is is so destructive has placed I'm sure you're familiar with the work of Sam Harris Sam has been one of the most interesting forces in my life at getting me to really even question this notion of free will and once you realize that free will may not even be yours it takes luck to a new level it's something I spent a lot of time thinking about now what advice would you offer somebody who is interested in the neurobiology of stress or behavior and who wants to be able to look back when they're your age and be as you know maybe accomplished is the wrong word I don't want I know you you sort of bristle at that but to have made as many contributions as you made I mean what in retrospect was sort of the secret to being able to pursue your bliss and be as successful as you've been and and look frankly to be where you are and to still have the passion that you have for what you're doing which to me is really the marker of success it's that you're sitting here saying there's this other problem and I you know like I could spend you know the next 20 years just thinking about that how do you think about how you've done that just damn luck every bit of the neurosis every bit of affective instability I've got every childhood trauma I've got tucked away

[02:13:47] I've titrated in just the right way that I've turned it into more productivity and incredibly lucky in that regard my capacity to sublimate emotion into intellectual pursuit into really really really wanting to understand something into I've just been very lucky in that regard I've gotten just the right levels of all sorts of like tumult and that ifs energized most productively in other words just huge amounts of luck huge amounts of luck and at least now coming later in life an increasing capacity to more carefully try to analyze what cost each type of ambition comes with hmm say more about that no I don't know this had much to do with my closing my lab four years ago big booming lab with lots of people in all sorts of labs around the world we were gonna kick the asses of by getting the answer to this or that and you know if you're raised in the right sort of rarified ambitious world of biomedical research at age 25 you've got a list down to the floor the disease is you're gonna vanquish and the problems you're gonna solve and all of that and you know kind of that point in life were you realizing it's not gonna happen is that what actually happened four years ago was it that much of a cerebral realization or was it combined with other factors you've described obviously having this network of people around you who matter the most and it was part of it just thinking I haven't spent enough time with them at the expense of this or was it the this problem is enormous and when you know a thousand years from now whether I worked this much harder or this much less it won't have altered the trajectory of X was like I mean how much of it is all of these holy love you know family real fast as they tend to do realizing your best work was decades behind you realizing there's this book you want to write where the only way you can do it is to just sit for really long stretches canyonfield work having collapsed a few years before body feeling older the limits to how many 80 hours of work a week you can do all of them converging what if I mean is such a cliche question what advice would you give the the 25-year old Robert as he was just finishing that PhD at rockefeller be less ambitious well I think on that note which by the way I think is some of the greatest advice one could ever get and receive and those of us who are still on the climbing ambition curve should do everything to listen to it I want it I want to thank you so much for taking the time to sit down with me and more importantly I think for just all of the work you've done and your continuing to do thank you so much no thanks for having me on this has been fun is the wrong word but stimulating good you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Atia MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc unsocial you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
