[00:00:05] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is senator bill frist senator frist is a former transplant surgeon he's a pilot though we don't even get into that in this episode it's just a whole other amazing story obviously a politician businessman healthcare policy expert i mean he's he's truly a renaissance man as you'll see he graduated from princeton and harvard medical school went on to study at stanford where he learned transplant surgery from the pioneering transplant surgeon of our era norman shumway before heading over to vanderbilt where he created the largest transplant program east of the mississippi he did that until the early 90s when he up and ran for the u.s senate in 1994 having never held public office before and perhaps even more remarkably than that he was elected as the 18th senate majority leader in 2002 taking him from the single least senior person in the u.s senate to the most senior person we spend a lot of time talking about his journey through medicine and ultimately 12 years in the senate through some of the difficult policy decisions and the controversial decisions that were made since leaving the senate in 2006 bill has done a number of things he sits on the board of more not-for-profits for-profit companies than you can count on probably spent a decade really focused on private equity before now shifting his attention to more venture-based funding he also hosts a podcast called a second opinion and we get into about two-thirds of what i had wanted to get into here that's how much i wanted to talk about but it's really a remarkable discussion and one of the most interesting things about bill that we do touch on here is that in 2005 he effectively called the pandemic he really laid it out through his experience in studying hiv and creating policy around hiv he was an instrumental part of pepfar which we talk about as well and also his experience with the anthrax scare post 911 and he basically looked at these examples coupled with what he saw on a lot of his travel to africa which he had done as a physician and basically said look it's not going to be a question of if we have a major pandemic it's a question of when and these were the things that needed to be in place and these are the likely things that are going to happen and you know unfortunately a lot of those things came true and and we weren't really ready so we spend a little bit of time on that and and finally we talk a little bit about just the current state of politics and even though this isn't a podcast about politics i think most people in the current environment can't help but acknowledging that we're in a bit of a strange environment and we talk a little bit about his his optimism as to how things might get better in the future so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with senator bill frist [Music] bill thank you so much for making time to sit down with me i know today was you had a lot of things going on in your personal life so i appreciate that we didn't reschedule this but it would have totally been understood if we needed to great to be with you peter by the way it feels weird calling you bill i always feel like i need to call you senator frist but the first time we spoke you were adamant that i call you bill so i'll tell you funny story when i left residency i had such a hard time not calling people mr so and so just because you know you talk to your patients that way right like yeah you know mr jones mrs smith we're here to talk about this and then when i got out in the real world people were like you know you can just call people by their first name was that a difficult transition for you you know these two things come to mind number one the most common thing i get do you get called senator or doctor you know people who want to be formal and of course i say call me bill but but that is a harder one because in in the senate you know especially today people had kind of down on the the the respect world and doctor is still pretty much up there so you know i say well doctor but you're supposed to call a senator et cetera et cetera but then i remember going to mass general up in boston being from nashville tennessee and being from nashville i called everybody out of respect mister if they were two or four years older than me and it may sound crazy to a lot of people listen that's just sort of the southern way of doing it and i remember going and working with a cardiac surgeon and right in the middle of the case i said yes sir and you're not supposed to say sir there's kind of like the mister and then he turned around and said don't you ever ever say sir to me again isn't that funny it's just depends on where you are you're exactly right at what point did you realize growing up that you wanted to be a doctor let alone a surgeon you know i i had a real sort of fortunate circumstance that i was last of five children and my dad was a family practitioner a doctor and my older brother who was 15 years older than me went into medicine so he was a doctor my middle brother ended up going into cardiac surgery so he was in this track and so i pretty much assumed i would go into medicine or or nursing or the healing profession from very early on for that reason i saw the gratification i saw the the way when dad would come home at night what he would talk about in terms of healing and giving people hope so that was always stuck in my my mind and i thought about other things and when i jumped up to college i majored in public and international affairs and so when i tried other things i always came right back to the healing profession in some some shape or form so when you were an undergrad you were not a pre-med and princeton is pretty well known for international affairs and things so you were kind of in the epicenter of where one would go to study such things but that didn't sway you from medicine did it plant a seed that ultimately there would be more for you to do than medicine you know in in high school and in the early years of college i interned in washington dc for congressman joe evans from tennessee at the time i spent a summer writing for a newspaper the nashville banner no longer a daily newspaper here in nashville so throughout it was always being interested in the broader aspects of medicine of being a doctor and i had no idea and i didn't have any master plan with it but i guess at every stage and now that i look back it gets reflected in my life that i always had other parallel interests going on and as you probably know and recall i'm a little older than you are it wasn't all that popular at the time when you were in medical school to have these other interests you know to basically say well i want to go write an op-ed on some technology when your professor is sitting there of medicine and basically the only thing in the world is medicine so it was always challenging and and not being in a pre-med tract at princeton but still wanting to go to medical school you know even the medical schools had a little bit of bias about coming in at that time very different today if you didn't demonstrate working in a lab and and all those other pre-med track things in those college years and so what was it like for you you know mass general obviously is one of the pillars of american medicine if my memory serves me correctly isn't mass general the second oldest hospital in the united states or is it the third oldest well i don't know but it's it's there and the tradition and is all there as well and so you've got this northeast training and then you go way out west for training and cardiac surgery what was that experience like back this was would have been early 80s that you went out to stanford early 80s and it's actually interesting in many ways mainly in retrospect of course but i went to harvard medical school and then i did the six years at mass general and did my cardiac fellowship at mass general but when i was just entering that fellowship it was fascinating from an ethical standpoint that the community there had decided with the board of trustees of the hospital that they were not going to do heart transplants and you know i'd kind of stayed at mass general because they done the early kidney transplant work in in america there had great immunologists and then i was you know 10 years into this and then all of a sudden the board of trustees and the broader community said it's too experimental it hasn't proven itself we can vaccinate a million people i'm exaggerating a little bit for the cost of one transplant and therefore they put a moratorium now what was the mortality at that time because bernard's first heart transplant was in 67 60 67 it was when christian bernard down in south africa did the first transplant and then after that there were 100 done in texas and then most of those patients died so it's kind of shut down and what was happening with shumway at the time what was he doing in the 70s another fascinating story and and norman shumway who was my mentor at stanford at the time was really outside of the mainstream of cardiac surgeons and you know this but again bringing our listeners in a little bit he had worked diligently for about 10 years in the laboratory figuring out this figure this heart transplant world systematically with disciplined not taking it to people until they figured out the science and then christian bernard came in he watched a little bit of this he was from south africa and more in an opportunist way he said well looks like somebody's figured it out so i'm going to go back to south africa and do it and so he did it some way from that mid 60s to when i got involved in the early 80s systematically had a program where other programs would do 100 or 50 or 30 like in out in texas by the way and then they would just leave it totally because the patients died well somebody would ask the question why are they dying he would figure it out so he was doing about 10 a year or 15 a year and figured out the science of the immunology of it the cardiac biopsies the instruments of it and in a very deliberate way and i tell that long story because it really had a huge impact on on me that the science is really fundamental it's important until you get the science right you should not be taking this to the clinical world know the facts get rid of the misinformation do clinical trials don't prematurely take things to the field and so in mass general they saw a 50 mortality very expensive procedure of of this moving hearts around and the the immunology and the equipment that was required and they said the greatest good for the most people is to not do heart transplants at mass general or peter bent brigham or beth israel or boston city to me from my perspective i said are you kidding me you know we have the opportunity to in a very ethical way figure out heart transplantation in a way that can save hundreds of thousands of lives if you don't get a heart transplant you die within six months if you get it you can live 10 15 20 30 years people i transplanted you know 28 years ago were still alive here in nashville and around the country so i got i can get fed up i did get fed up but instead of staying at mass general i said i'm going to california to train with this one person in america who systematically had spent 20 years developing heart transplantation and continued to do that because the overall field the overall heart transplant world continues to evolve i mean to me it's just such an amazing story within medicine to go back to the first transplants within kidney and then to look at heart and and in some ways liver was almost the most ridiculous of them in terms of the complexity of it you know i don't know if you have like a bucket list of people you wish you could have met or interviewed who are no longer alive and i'm sure you probably met thomas starzell but if i think about people i wish i could have met thomas starzel would be very high on that list i don't know if you ever read his book puzzle people but i can't recommend it highly enough to people who love stories about the history of medicine to me it is it sounds so much like what you describe shumway doing which is systematically in the face of non-stop failure watching you know bad outcome after bad outcome after bad outcome but in patients for whom there is no other choice i mean there is no such thing as an extracorporeal liver so if a person is in liver failure they are going to die there is no temporizing measure and i don't remember the numbers because it's been so long since i read it even for the second time it's a book i've read twice but i one thing that stuck with me when i read it which is one is the belief that you have to have that this is gonna get better and two just the personality trait that says i'm not gonna get broken by short-term failure after failure after failure because i'm seeing some other progress and whether it is like we're making strides in the immunology because back in the early 80s what was your two what was your immunosuppressive regimen i mean prednisone and mmp i mean what you didn't have much well and it comes back and we're seeing it today with today's technology which is even moving faster but these great breakthroughs which require this deliberate thinking in spite of these challenges that seem insurmountable there were technological mechanical ones like doing a cardiac biopsy all these patients were dying early on because the heart would reject get inflamed right afterwards and so then the typical surgeon would walk away from that and say i'm not doing this someone said okay let's figure out the inflammation so developed an instrument that you can go through the neck into the heart sounds terrible but it's real simple you can do it in three minutes and figured out how to to address the inflammation to diagnose it and treat it and then you in the medicines that you mentioned when i started in the transplant world and success was not that good early on it got better but we were using two drugs one was called prednisone or steroids that most people have taken or understand and the other is immuran and we didn't have a new drug that came along in about 1982 which is cyclosporine when you added that drug which was serendipitously discovered from a fungus over in i think sweden or switzerland when you added that to the cocktail all of a sudden the mortality which may have been at 50 went to 20 just that one because if you can adjust the immunological treatment and make it where it's not as severe you don't push down the immune system so much where people would die from infections but i think the impo important point in all of this which i think you're you're leading and and i'm sort of fitting into is is that science is this evolutionary process and that the greats the stars or tom stars the university of pittsburgh did all transplants but the world icon leader in liver transplants which was about two or three years behind heart transplants and the norman shumways of the world had that deliberate that discipline that focused process in taking these insurmountable challenges that were impossible to do and systematically over a period of time capturing the best of the best even when there are lots of losses along the way ultimately be successful this is just kind of a broader historical question of surgery when you think back of the last 150 years of surgery the modern era right then you think about the giants right the blaylocks the hallsteads the shumways linahan starsel i mean these people took they they had step function changes in the field their existence and the teams around them right when i when you talk about a surgeon you have to talk about the critical care staff the anesthesiology staff i mean no surgeon can do what they do alone but they fundamentally changed surgery do you believe that there are any more step functions ahead in surgery are there are there sort of from a technical standpoint or combination of technology medicine instrumentation like is there something that you think is still an untapped opportunity in the way that you know you were talking about what shumway or starzell did for example yeah you know it's good the transplant world's a dramatic world that we've talked about where i would go take a heart out of one person who is brain dead and then replace a diseased heart and a living person totally and even me describing it is pretty gross i mean it's brutal i mean you talk about lifting a heart out of somebody and putting it in there and i say yes i've done 100 100 times and then people say it doesn't sound right it is amazing though i mean it's worth pausing on that for a moment it is it's hard to believe and i haven't participated in nearly as many as you so maybe it gets old after a while but i wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me if every time you did it it still felt magical yeah it probably never wore off ever in terms of what you just explained it's profound never i think you don't have to have faith really people will jump to that immediately but the idea of me getting a call and not me it's done by everybody now at that time not that many but now it's done in every major hospital around but getting a call flying off in the middle of the night taking a heart out of somebody putting it in a bucket with ice around it and then putting it on an airplane traveling for three hours coming back opening up a patient and spending 45 minutes put the heart in it's just like a piece of meat you're sitting in the chest and then you just step back and as you warm the the patient up the body up all of a sudden that inert piece of meat that you've been carrying it's terrible even describe it that way all of a sudden slowly that that sort of magical moment it would begin like a bag of worms just kind of moving around and then bang all of a sudden it would start beating rhythmically you know 70 beats a minute and pumping blood throughout the body and then that patient goes home a week later and you know it's it's miraculous so i agree with it and you you can't fully explain it but it is but it took the shumways and the stars and people like that to do that and then my generation which came right beyond that and then beyond the transplant world there are other great innovations you remember worked and i don't know exactly when you were doing your surgery but taking out gallbladders where you see these big incisions and these bloody feels and hip replacements i mean all that's been revolutionized through through scopes and minimally invasive surgery so that will probably continue with more robotic surgery but i think the really exciting things will be at the cellular level of regenerative medicine instead of replacing that heart keeping that old heart in the person injecting some of the cells in there understanding what the human genome project delivered to us back in the early 2000s with some manipulation having those cells that you put in there liven up and energize the dead cells that are there that kind of breakthrough is going to really be exciting coming forward so is that surgery or not i'm not sure it's it takes things down to almost a synthetic biology world which to me is where things are really exciting in terms of at the level of the cellular interaction and and surgically putting in whether it's mitochondria a lot of things we're talking about with covert and vaccines and all today that's sort of where so much of the future is i think so when you got to stanford was bruce wright's there or had he already left for hopkins he was leaving at exactly that time at that time at stanford as you know there were four cardiac surgeons and chumway the cardiac surgeon who was fathered to them all most of people had gravitated there because of his approach being sad outside of the norm not a lot of respect for tradition for tradition's sake big believer in team approach in boston you have to work 10 years to get to put in a stitch you had to wait your time on the east coast if you were good at it and you were a first year intern if you were a fourth year medical student and some way saw you operate he would let you do what he wouldn't let a resident with 10 years of training due if you could do it so as more kind of merit-based there all of that approach and so that was the culture that he built huge respect for nurses huge respect it wasn't about him it was about the people around him he said he was the world's greatest first assistant and for those who don't follow surgery the first assistant's the person who's across from the main surgeon who kind of helps the main surgeon do the work and what he was saying basically it's not about me it's about us as a as a team and bruce wright came out of that tradition and he had just left and of course didn't know him well because uh he went and went to hopkins after that so you you finish getting your you know basically your transplant training at stanford and then you head back to is it vanderbilt you you go straight to yeah yeah and and you served there on the faculty for quite some time and you're building a program obviously right there was no transplant program yeah you're building no yeah and at that time we had the stanford program and there were a few other programs around but eastern mississippi there were no established real programs in tennessee there was no heart transplant program so built a program on the model of stanford and heart transplants and and i want to come back to where you're going but once we mastered heart transplants this whole field of lung transplants three years later had never been done never been successful but because of that drug cyclist form we were able to do that that's what bruce and norm did together right they did the first heart lung transplant they did heart lung lung ironically you have the heart lungs yeah so you have the heart it seems like taking a lung would be easier but it's not so the combined heart lung where you take them both and that's what bruce writes in chumway did and that's what i brought back to vanderbilt was there any resistance to this given what you just described on the east coast being kind of a bias towards hey this is still very costly on a cost per life basis there's probably more efficient things that we can do with resources nowhere in this have we talked about where insurance companies are how are insurance companies thinking about this type of a procedure at that time it was interesting so insurance and the payers you have medicare government medicaid and then you have the the commercial payers at that time it was still investigational so medicare our government did not reimburse for transplants it was regarded as experimental for about eight years and they did a very smart thing they designated certain centers to figure it out and then once the survival was sufficient and you were you were qualified as a center of excellence then they would start reimbursing you the payer system was a little bit the same thing and i was again lucky and i wouldn't have come to vanderbilt if it hadn't been that far sort of thinking ahead they basically said bill to get the program up you've done you know scores and scores of heart transplants you were trained by the best for your first 10 transplants because we know this is that about just the opposite of mass general we know this is life-saving to thousands and thousands of people dying across america we also know that it's not 99 successful but what we'll do for your first 10 transplants to get your program up and running we will cover you if the insurance does not and so that gave me enough to and we did maybe six and then it started being reimbursed and then over a period of about eight years every commercial payer medicare and medicaid began to reimburse because they had the outcomes a hundred percent mortality everybody would die who needed a transplant everybody would die within six months without it and if you got it you on average 80 of the time would live at least five years if you got beyond that would live 10 15 20 or 30 years what was the pressure like on you during those first transplants i mean here you are it's one thing when you're at stanford and you're under the umbrella of shumway and this incredible environment he's built which as you said you've got the best anesthesiologist you've got the best nurses you've got the best perfusionists like everything that is needed to support that program you have the best of and the culture is already there and you're a fellow within that system and now you have to go out and hang your own shingle and you have to now train everybody to do what you took for i'm not saying you took it for granted right but what one could have easily taken for granted at stanford and all of a sudden now you're the operating surgeon you don't have shumway first assisting you and you don't have a lot of time to figure this out you can't take 50 transplants to get it worked out do you remember what those first few days were like i mean that must have been unbelievable stress because it's two stresses it's the it's the obvious stress of i gotta save this person's life but there's even there's a bigger thing at stake which is enough bad outcomes and this program gets shut down and we don't know what that means for the future transplantation yeah and then there was an additional burden that at that time chumway was training the great cardiac surgeons they weren't great they were young people like me at the time but just like bruce writes who he talked about he didn't send them to hopkins but bruce came out of this very interesting culture where team was very important where humility was very important that's juxtaposed the way most people think about cardiac surgeons who are in there you know high pressure type a throwing instruments you never saw that and so when i came to vanderbilt east of mississippi bruce was up in hopkins all of a sudden all over the country people said why don't we go to these guys instead of going out to california so all of a sudden within a year of me being at vanderbilt starting a program from scratch i was getting referrals you know hundreds of people coming in saying i want the shumway approach shumway says you know you're as good as he is you know that's the way he would talk coming in but to answer your question you know it comes back to to what i threw in about shumway saying he was the best first assistant i came here there was a guy named walter merrill walter miracle was hopkins trained excellent surgeon pediatric surgeon adult surgeon he could do it all he was gifted the most humble person in the world and walter had come out to stanford to watch me operate to kind of learn about the program for vanderbilt and so we had this dialogue and from day one for the next 10 years there wouldn't be a transplant that we did and we did hearts and heart lungs and we did lungs we did infant transplants we were transplanting kids or babies at two days of age and three days of age there was never a transplant that i was involved with that walter marrow wasn't there linked side by side as sort of this alter ego and with that and building the team with nurses and profusionists to sort of share the same shumway mentality of team first keep it simple stupid don't be afraid to double dribble if you don't get it perfect the first time go back and do it again and it's worth saying all that a little because i want to jump ahead a little bit because that program after i left has continued to grow 10 years 15 20 years later to where that program today is the largest heart transplant program in america it does more heart transplants than in any center that people are you know listening to us in their cities today it has nothing to do with me really but it's taking that experience which again you understand that what the resident's experience is and and the young faculty is if you're lucky enough to have a mentor and you can capture that culture and you go out and apply it so i replicated exactly what i saw at stanford to get it up and running those first two years worked with a great team and then with that we were on the cutting edge of the early lung transplants early heart lung transplants and then ultimately obviously we added liver to it and we had bone marrow already we added pancreas and became a large multi-organ transplant center now where was debakey and cooley in the midst of this when did the big texas centers participate they were early and it fits with texas and they were great surgeons and you know they are up there and they would say they're they're above starzell and and in some way just because their their egos were the egos were big and they were excellent surgeons and they did these incremental leaps in surgery and vascular surgery both of them are in the same town in houston texas and they which fits with the ego the confidence and ability jumped on transplants as soon as shumway did the first one in america christian bernard didn't want a few months later chumway did one and then shumway was going to continue along 15 a year the way he was doing deliberate let's learn iterative process but debakey and cooley said well listen this thing looks pretty good it seems to work pretty well and so they did in texas this is all in the late 60s so remember this was all 67 68 and between 68 and about 69 they did i think 110 heart transplants in competition with each other do it big do it texas style and then all those patients died and they died which comes back to the story someone was out there figuring out how to treat the heart rejection this inflammation using that little that little cannula he puts through the neck and they didn't have the patience for that and so they shut their programs down and went on to other things and then in the late 70s started doing a few and then the 80s kind of picked up where everybody else did i mean the whole story of debacy and cooley i don't know if there's a book about it but if there is i'd love to read it the rivalry between them is unbelievable right i mean it's two legends in cardiac surgery both of whom will tell you that they're the greatest of all time did they ever reconcile before debate i think debakey died first right yeah they did and the hospitals were right across the street and never did really i think when when debakey or cooley got a medal of honor that there was some kind of congratulations that went on but in essence never never did yeah it's interesting i never met debakey but i met cooley because he trained at hopkins and so every night when you're on call when you'd be walking through the blaylock hallway you know hopkins is such a storied place like it just there's never a piece of tradition that's not enough right and you'd see these pictures of the young denton cooley and he was just upsettingly handsome right so sure enough we're at the american college of surgeons one year and each you know as you know every university or every medical school has their own thing so you'd go to the you know you go to the vanderbilt one and you'd probably go stop at the stanford one and you'd go stop at the mgh one and so at the hopkins one cooley shows up and i'm there with my closest friend from residency who happens to be a cardiac surgery fellow about to go and embark on his pediatric cardiac fellowship and cooley was talking with both of us he says oh what year are you in and i think i was in my third year or something and he says to my friend jorge salazar what year are you in and jorge says well i'm in my ninth year because that's you know at the time by that point it's nine years just to do adult cardiac surgery and then he said and then you're gonna go off and do pediatric cardiac i think is another two years at ucsf and he's like gosh that's just unbelievable i mean back in my day it only took six years to become a cardiac surgeon now admittedly i was better than everybody else and he just but he said it completely seriously like there was no irony in that statement and and we got such a kick out of that but i guess there's a there's there's some truth to it i mean he was a gifted surgeon yeah and he did really they're icons and contributed so much and they're you know hundreds of thousands of people alive today because of people they've trained and procedures they've done and and really amazing icons in that field of cardiac surgery they probably they won't never be anybody like them again and cardiac surgery changed so much it's one of the reasons but but they were just too talented prodigy type surgeons do you think that that medicine can no longer attract that caliber of individual like has the profession changed such that the best and the brightest would never consider medicine today i'm not close enough to what a what the hot shot college kid is doing today but you know given for example the incredible changes we've seen in technology is it really you know the case that the the coolies and the debakeys and the shumways of the world if they were 20 years old today would be going to silicon valley or we'd be going to boston and going into biotech startups like you know there are other ways to serve people that don't involve literally going into medicine and and i do you ever think about that like is there is there has there been some sort of passing of the torch in terms of the war for talent you know when you think of the stars uh debakeys and shamway and the great surgeons you think of great athletes you think of the athletic part of it and part they're using their hands they want you you got to be fast deliberate you got to keep it simple you got to be right and i think because of technology that's less important i think the fact that we're operating through telescopes and soon microscopes when you ask your earlier question that this sort of athletic competitive hero on the field cowboyish sort of approach i think we're we're beyond that just to most of the big sort of blood and guts that kind of imagery has passed by but to go back to your question no i think medicine still and maybe in some ways even more so because we've opened up this whole world of biology synthetic biology and at the cellular level the regenerative medicine and the use of stem cells all of these things are going to attract and they're going to be they're going to go in as medicine because they want to heal they want to be a part of something bigger than themselves and not just behind a microscope that i think it's going to continue to attract great great people and if you look at at least here at vanderbilt where i'm familiar with medical school applications they're an all-time high right now and people say yes but the quality is not there and the attraction of making a lot of money or doing the next uber or airbnb is is out there i think all of that's right but i i i think we're going to continue to see and maybe even see an increase in the overall quality of people applying to medical school and then going to medical school and then entering these fields i'll ask you the question i get asked all the time and i think you can answer it with frankly a far better lens which is you know what advice do you have for for somebody today who wants to go into medicine doesn't quite know how they want to do it based on all you've seen and what you see in the future in the in the landscape and now we're getting ahead of ourselves because we haven't got to this part of the discussion where we're going to talk about policy and things like that but given what you know about the profession of medicine and also the landscape of payers hospital systems consolidation of these things at risk versus not at risk reimbursement all these things what do you say to somebody do you say go forth and conquer do you say you know here's a hedge that you want to have in place i mean what advice do you have for somebody to be successful you know where you started it's probably still my philosophy and i'm still active in in teaching here and mentoring a lot of people in medicine and in health and i think staying broad i kind of fell into that because i knew what my track was going to be in medicine and therefore i wanted to do journalism and i wanted to try the policy world and wanted to go to washington and wanted to write about technology all at the time i was going to medical school then it was harder as we said because there was a stigma almost against it and today i think the professors in medical school understand that the best whether it's on the social side or even on the technical side the best are people who bring broad experiences have the curious mind that isn't narrowed down to just one area to you know just cardiac surgery or just bypass surgery or valves but has that curiosity throughout life so i'd still continue to encourage people to to live as broadly as possible to develop those interests to look for your talents and if they're outside of medicine figure out some way either as a a hobby or something on the side or write an article every week about it to keep that going and i guess because i have jumped around so much and kind of changed career every 10 or 12 years that i see how in truth it's all the same thing it's all health and it's all healing and it's all giving hope there's lots of different ways to do it let's fast forward a little bit to call it the early 90s do you have a sense at this point that you want to make a run for senate or how were you starting to think about a transition into elected office it's interesting my goal was never to be in the united states senate ever ever and i'd spent right at 10 years learning all this surgery and medical school and how to do transplants and how to do surgery and then about 10 years here at vanderbilt and we built a transplant center a multi-organ transplant center that was a great foundation for the future and then i just began to ask myself i did not serve in vietnam which a lot of people just right above me had done i've not been in the service had not done anything actively other than learn to be a doctor and you know spend 18 hours a day doing it for for those those years and i said given that i was running a large transplant center and doing a lot of good i felt what would be the one other thing that one might do to affect health maybe not of an individual but health of a community or health of a population and i said well you know do you go run a university i'd been on the board of princeton university as a young alumnus and sort of saw the power there and thought about that no because i just don't think i can reach quite enough people and so i systematically eliminated you know doing anything a new policy could do it because policy could affect the world and i'd seen that back 20 years before when i'd been an intern during the college years and so i said the only place is really united states senate i have a job i know what i can do but if you could get to that position not to change health care necessarily not to at the time it was clinton care and and all sorts of political issues it really wasn't for that reason it really was an extension of what i saw as a little boy when my dad would come home and that was in the days he had doctor's bags and he would sit down exhausted and say you know the greatest gratification has been able to give somebody hope and all of a sudden i said policy can do that and so i jumped and nobody in my family had ever served in public office nobody had you know run for public office they were not overly partisan my mom was probably more of a democrat my dad was probably more republican and i was probably neither you know i was excellent doing heart surgery every day so it really was an extension of that earlier pull probably genetic in some way of wanting to serve and that being a way to serve a population and you know it sounds kind of patting yourself on the shoulder now in retrospect but that was what was going through my mind and i didn't have anybody to look to my dad said are you crazy and he's no longer alive he died 20 years ago but he said you know you're at the top of the world in surgery and innovation and running a large laboratory and writing papers and you know why would you leave that to go into this world of policy and the answer then was what it is now i also said i wasn't going to stay forever i said you know i'm not a politician i love policy and i want to affect change and i want to innovate but i only i only want to go do it for 10 years and that's how i took the leap the senate is the highest piece of congress so to you know i could under it's almost easier to understand if you said look i'm going to go run for the house of representatives i don't know how many how many seats are there on the house representatives in in tennessee nine okay but to say i'm gonna be one of the two people running for senate is is kind of remarkable how long of a process was that so the election was 96 when did you have to get serious about this is this like a two-year process a one-year process i spent a year and a half i had to leave i didn't have to leave but you either do it or you don't and that's the advice i give people if you're going to get go all in so probably about two and a half years before i started talking the problem i had is my parents didn't really buy into it my family really didn't because kind of hard to understand so who do you talk to and there hadn't been a physician elected to the united states senate 100 people two from every state there hadn't been a physician elected to the senate since 1928 so i didn't have anybody to call or go see who'd gone through this eye of the needle medical school and internship and residency and fellowship and practice and that made it hard and maybe that was a good thing they may have said you know get out of here don't do it but that was hard and so i systematically took about a year this one i was still practicing and i went to see howard baker he'd been majority leader of the united states senate before a centrist i went and talked to lamar alexander at the time who had been governor but he hadn't been in the senate i ultimately recruited him to run for the senate and went and talked to al gore at the time who was a senator and had great conversations and my fundamental question was am i right or is this just like you know dreams and to the one they said it's a tough business half the people gonna hate you all the time and half are gonna like you and it's gonna be very different than medicine but if you're really serious about it you ought to do it howard baker who's just an amazing guy and again he was also from tennessee he the first time he didn't listen to me very much and or he politely did the second time you know politely and then about the third or fourth time i went to see him he finally said okay you must be interested and go ahead and make the jump i mean you're having a chance to speak with al gore when he's the vice president at this point no he was still he was right during that period of time and that was going to open up a seat actually in tennessee at the time he was still in the senate because this was in the early 90s oh oh this is before 92 then even wow exactly and they saw 91 and then ultimately that seat opened up and then i had an option of running for that seat which is in open seats easier to win because you've got two people in there that nobody knows and it's sort of a flip of the coin or the other seat and i i don't know exactly why but i went the less traditional route and challenged an incumbent and and i know why because i was the fresh face and he was a person been around for 18 years but it was unconventional to go that route at the time so you ran in 94 against the incumbent is that correct yeah and you you you won by a pretty hefty margin correct yeah and that was i had a a primary with six others yeah i was going to ask you about the primary what what was the primary like back then compared to for example what primaries are like today which is a fight to the extreme thank goodness it's not today where people are getting pushed out tennessee until recently and has changed in the last four years but until recently tennessee had produced senators that were in the center the eastern part of the state was more republican the western was more democratic in the middle where i live was sort of in the middle so if you were versatile enough to move through that state your politics tended to be very principled it might be principled democrat or republican but you're pretty much you know going to be appealing to a broad range of people so in our primary there were six people all out of that same ilk my disadvantage was that i was an outsider i hadn't played my political dues with the republican party number one i was from middle tennessee and not east tennessee and that was it so but the the race was very different and in that primary just interestingly enough was the person who i ultimately recruited to the united states senate bob corker and bob corker and i he was a outsider and i was an outsider he and i were in the primary so it started at six came down to two all races are tough races he always say that iris was a clean race and ours was 100 percent cleaner than these races today but it's obvious hand-to-hand combat this politics stuff and so i don't want to over idealize the way it was but we were out of this extreme sort of polar opposites where in a primary somebody's driven to the to the either extreme right or extreme left do you remember what the main policy issues that you were running on in the primary and then ultimately in the general that year in 94. and that comes with the other thing so and because ultimately one which nobody had expected nobody chances were probably one in 100 and the other thing that did happen that it didn't start that way when i jumped in but at the end in 1994 ended up being a lot of republicans coming in so i was part of that wave i was still the least expected i was the only person to be an incumbent united states senator who came in and ultimately won but there was the luck end of it being at the right place at the right time as well and so the policy issues issues ironically when you look at today were balance the budget over time eliminate the debt keep taxes small so those are sort of the big issues there are these big physical issues that were out there welfare reform was just talked about in that period of time ultimately the bill passed about three or four years later but those were sort of the three big issues and just to go back to the first point you made what you're really saying is look in 94 two years into a president's term the opposite party generally has a tailwind at that first midterm election correct that's correct for example i remember in 2010 two years into obama's term you get a little bit of that tailwind for republicans and vice versa so this in 94 was the the same thing now how did you learn the mechanics of the u.s senate i mean i got to tell you i find this stuff really interesting bill just in part because i grew up in another country and i have a an inferiority complex like i didn't learn u.s history growing up so i you know you asked my daughter she's like dad why are you always grilling me on us history and it's like hey i'm trying to learn this stuff with you but oh my god trying to figure out what the whip does versus the minority leader versus this and what you know what this means in this bill versus that i mean it just strikes me as when you go straight into the u.s senate that's like going straight into the major leagues never playing triple a double a and little league baseball like how do you learn all of that stuff i mean was that the i mean if if the first time you're doing a transplant by yourself is scary i would think the first day you're sitting on the floor of the u.s senate is ten times more scary yeah it was um i guess when i was first running i didn't know if i'd win or not and then about a week out i felt it that i knew i would win so that the worst part with the first the november to january equivalent 22nd or january 4th not knowing what all this is about the senate doesn't have a robert rules of orders there's not a book you read there's a little book of rules and you'll hear you know you hear about it every two years they have to pass the rules but it's like a 30 page book the real book is precedent that set and precedent is experience it's being around it's age it's knowledge it is is you know all the other stuff but i had zero you gave me a 30 page book you know it's like it like in medicine or going to a new rotation in your residency you know you just hop in and do it and you do it fast and you do it hard and you may do it for a month you'll have to switch the next month so that would have been easy the the challenge of the senate is that it's not a book that you can read and i had the disadvantage of not having anybody i knew in the senate either no friends no no sort of colleagues in retrospect that's all a real advantage i was able to come in as an outsider as a physician somebody who has looked at to be trusted somebody that is looked at to be fair somebody who learns predominantly not the way a typical politician does it that i know better than you it's i gotta listen if the patient comes in the door which i had done for the previous 20 years i want to size them up i want to listen i want to look at the body language i don't want to say anything until they give me that chief complaint or that last you know look and or or question as they go out the door and all of that which is second nature it's part of being a physician or being a healer or a nurse is that listing that empathy component is part of the culture but really the being it is in the dna of physicians and nurses and and counselors and healers the room i walked into had 63 lawyers 63 lawyers i walked into that chamber and and that chamber every chair was full with somebody who had for 10 years been arguing legal cases and and all and so you'd say that's a disadvantage again ended up being a pretty big advantage and i didn't realize it at the time but by listening very carefully by working with trust and upholding that trust because i came in with this image and the reality of being a physician people would come to me and they'd say what do you think and you know how what is your look on this from the outside you've been around patients every day 20 different patients every day for the last 20 years of your life and you've listened to them you know i've been in the united states senate about as far from real people as you can get and so all of that came as real advantages and again i didn't know it there hadn't been a doctor there i told you since you know 1928 or elected since 1928 so that was it and kind of stuck with that throughout but it wasn't health care issues when there was a health care issue it would all come to me immediately because the time healthcare was probably i don't know 16 of our economy and yet there was nobody in the chamber who'd ever taken care of a patient or written a prescription or been involved at all and so that kind of information gravitated importantly as well you know you mentioned that 63 percent of the senate were lawyers one percent physicians it's probably a dated statistic so i don't know what it is today but i can't imagine it's far from this but the last time i looked at the stats when you looked at the entire congress both the house and the senate combined slightly less than one percent had any training in secondary education so whether it be an undergraduate degree in science or an advanced degree like yours why do you think that is well you know it's interesting and then right now there are three physicians in the senate and so i kind of broke the glass ceiling and that's been three or four and in the house are 14. so it's clearly more than what it was when i so it's more but if you look at it historically and you sort of start now and go backwards in 50-year increments don't exaggerate but i'll give you just the image in the first 50 years of our country the start of 17 sort of 50 to 18 or 1810 there were i think like 25 or 24 physicians in the senate over a six year period in and out if you look at the next 50 years 1800 to 1850 it was 12 about half of that and if you look at 1850 to 1900 about half of that and then 1900 to 1950 it was about half of that so it got down to one so it hadn't always been that way but over time as medicine got more specialized as some of the stigma that that we talked about earlier that you know if you're in medicine even if you could look at policy with the ama the american medical association you're not a serious doctor that was kind of the stigma so people were discouraged and then doctors wanted to focus on their on their work and therefore they didn't put themselves out there and then even after i got there you know physicians don't support the political system that much they don't get involved in the policy or politics and i think it's been to the detriment of patients and america because physicians are the best voice for 300 million people because they're listening to their problems and their challenges and and the socio-economic and the diversity issues and so they should be more interested and so i don't think it's it's really that the body itself had a aversion to them it's really that people from the science world didn't move in that direction and they're good reasons not to i mean it tells you it tears your life apart i mean you give up all your privacy families are destroyed uh you have 50 percent of the the country hating you not hating exaggerating but well certainly today today yeah you really do so i can't fully explain it but i can tell you with the sort of issues that that we are confronted with today and the issues that i ultimately you know even my 12-year period we addressed i was not the lone voice but i spent a lot of time explaining what science is and as science was progressing and technology was progressing ethical issues were involved they would gravitate naturally to the person sitting next to you if they happen to be a doctor on the on the chamber floor there's just been too few of them i would say over time when you think about that first term in the senate from 94 to 2000 you alluded to it earlier you came into this saying without any ambiguity you were hoping to serve two terms in the senate not a day longer and you were never going to seek higher office thereafter why were you so confident to make that assertion i mean most people who would serve in the senate would want to maybe keep their options open and say you know look maybe if things go well there's i'd stay for a third term or i'd seek higher office why were you so adamant about this 12-year limit yeah i actually told the people of tennessee seven million people also for 12 years i've got a job i believed very much in a concept called the citizen legislator the concept that somebody goes it's at the federal level that goes they leave their home they leave the people they stay in touch with them but they go to washington dc to serve as a citizen legislator the citizen the broad experiences the trials the tribulations the the challenges the understanding the empathy and applying all that to help shape the laws of the land and then after i've done that go back and live under the laws that that i've passed or we've passed and that's just a philosophy and i believe that today not for everybody but i think the majority of people in the senate benefits from it and i think people benefit from it not to get locked up in this very almost encapsulated environment of the senate or the house of representatives itself it was just clear to me and that perspective came from medicine the breadth that a clinical person has in taking care of acute medicine and chronic medicine and mental and issues in the transplant world you're taking care of all of that that the world is much broader and that you've got a job to do and after it's done leave let somebody else who may be brighter or smarter or bring their citizen legislator experiences there so it was a philosophy for me and the right one to do it did allow me in my last term to focus on on instead of fundraising and having to cast boats in a certain way that looked politically good and that sort of thing which is just part of the business it allowed me just to have a clean slate do what i thought was right and move ahead so would you endorse the idea of term limits i mean this idea if we just said look no senator can ever serve more than two terms no member of congress can ever serve more than six terms if you wanted to keep it equal at 12 years i mean i've heard many people suggest that that could be one piece of the remedy to some of the situations we find ourselves in i mean i i personally i find that to be a very appealing idea and initially i did too and you asked about those first days going in and i think of those first days just as an aside my dad who was a doctor came up to visit me and he said on my door it said mr bill frist another one said the honorable bill frist and there's been these gold plates on the door and on your chair on the senate floor and he walked around he grabbed me by the army walked me back down the hall and said son you know bill i love the fact that your united states senate i may not have wanted you to be here but you need to change that take that tag off and put dr bill frist there and so that whole whole world of of being the a senator for a period of time sort of renting occupying the office but not owning the office was was one to answer your question no i think term limits would be a huge mistake of the united states senate this job is is complicated and it's equally complicated to heart surgery and and and other things that i've done the breadth of knowledge to be really good at it and you can't know everything but ultimately every law of the land every federal law of the land is going to come through you everyone and that is really tough the procedures we talked about the rule book and the books of precedence and the things that aren't written down when i came in and then jumping ahead when i got into leadership all of a sudden who did i turn to i'm not smart enough i'm sort of you know average sort of intelligence overall and i work really hard and so i would turn to the person who'd been there for 18 years or 24 years and i would ask what it was like 20 years ago or 25 years ago what is the precedent itself and not go to some staff member who's 25 years old who's very good but hadn't been around and that would not have been possible that would not have been possible if there weren't a handful or 20 or 30 i don't know what the number is of people that are there and so the system works pretty good when you have this this this crucible of this this mixture of people like me who say i'm not staying any longer or bob corker who i helped recruit to the senate who said you know i'm just going to stay for for 12 years or so and then go back and do other things but i do think this admixture is important because of the complexity of the job in that first term what was the camaraderie like between parties you hear stories of i'm in the middle of a reading a book about abraham lincoln right now and maybe these books somewhat romanticize it but obviously there have been huge swings in sort of how partisan the country has been but there are these periods of time in which politicians of opposite parties still socialize together there was still a degree of respect that existed even if you disagreed on policy as you kind of alluded to it earlier you might spend the week in dc without your family and that would be a time when these would be your colleagues and you'd go home on the weekend sort of thing i mean what was that environment like and how much time did you spend with members of the opposite party your own party and what were those relationships like and above all else how did that influence your ability to bring your empathy to the side of hey i understand another person's point of view even if i don't agree with it yeah it's it's really important and like you you don't want to over romanticize the past and recent events you're asking the same question is that the way it's always been or is this brand new and the first six years in the last six years were different for me i served under two presidents one democrat president clinton and the other president bush or with them and it wasn't because of them but it was because of in part media and because of the in part the internet in part initially it was cable tv as we had more of this sort of real time nothing could be done behind closed doors if i wanted to take a trip called a codel a fact-finding trip to africa and i've spent a lot of time in africa i would take and go on a trip with four democrats senators and four republicans and we would go to four countries in africa and we'd be together we'd travel together we would share meals together we would have discussions together and over the period of sort of that 12 years but over a period about four or five years that became the junket and so every you know new york times wall street anybody would come and say you're spending taxpayer dollars by having a vacation over in you know southern sudan anybody who's been to southern sudan knows that ain't a vacation yeah no exactly but you know it's easy when you're in this sort of fully exposed media world in real time where it's hard to counter everything and so that really contributed a lot so early on probably the first four years a lot more of that having dinners and these aren't like georgetown parties and all we're talking about in the senate dining room sitting together and then over that 12-year period much much less of that and it's gotten much much worse since then i'm still very close to a number of senators and it's gotten much much worse since then but the trend began to change right through that period of time and really the scrutiny of the media played a role in that of course the the the critic will argue well isn't that the job of the media to to bring the critical eye to it i mean what is that balance between the media holding politicians accountable versus actually creating a counterproductive environment where it polarizes everybody more and creates distance between them how do we think about this well we're seeing it play out and i think you're exactly right the transparency is critically important and past politics is has played that out in our history that you know hiding things in the long run is unhealthy and destructive to our government to our the fundamentals of our democracy i think what changed it all is that what we're seeing today more than even when i was there but is the misinformation that campaigns if the media like on this whole thing of codels being junkets make the accusation there's no way really to counter it and if misinformation is put out there and it's in real time and again this is the period of time you know before twitter and before facebook and all but if you put the information out there it was much harder to counter but it was same sort of stuff it was misinformation that was there therefore the institutional structure the corporate structure of having one lunch together which we used to do democrat and republican ultimately evolved into the republicans going to one room and democrats going to another room something they already did for business but that joint room of getting together disappeared and that's unhealthy and there are ways that you can fix that i won't jump ahead with that but there are ways that you can fix that and it does have to be fixed it comes back to this being a doctor i think the empathy word really does come back to this connectedness doesn't mean you have to agree with this connected of seeing two sides of things and just less empathy in the corporate structure of the united states senate today what committees did you sit on in your first term in the senate yeah it's interesting i sat on the banking committee actually i had been on the board of a bank ironically before it's not the reason i went on it but pete domenici was on it and when i was choosing my committees the way committees are chosen you're i was 100th and seniority so i had 99 people about me were you the only freshman senator elected in 94 no there were others elected but the ones if you've served in public office before got it you get credit for if you've been a governor you get credit for it yeah yeah so you are the lowest totem pole yeah i mean i thought i was okay being a heart surgeon and taking care of people and saving their lives when they got up there boy they could care less especially when it came to committee's choice or it came to anything that had to do with appropriations or power and that sort of thing but the committees i ended up were great committees one was the banking committee fascinating time and always a good committee has no power per se but a really important committee in terms of constituents back at home and the health committee the health education labor pension committee which is health and that it did include things like i chaired the subcommittee on disability policy and you know for the whole united states of america every law of the disability world had to come through that particular committee and then went to foreign affairs but about two years later and stayed on that throughout because i had had done so much travel to to other countries doing medical work and it fit there but those were the ones in the first few years that that i was on and learned a tremendous amount and then in the last four to year six joined the commerce committee and the commerce committee that was the time there was telecommunication and all of the great reform that was going on then i've resisted asking you this question before because i wanted to ask you for the first time during this discussion how is it that someone so young and so junior and tenure can become the senate majority leader at such an early time in their tenure so i guess walk me through the late 90s you're obviously going for re-election you won by quite a healthy margin but what were the string of events that allowed you to go from being still a relatively junior senator to being you could argue the second most powerful person in washington after the president yeah it's an interesting sort of line narrative in large part because that was not my goal and if you're going to start with 100th and crt and jump to number one in a period of six years uh it does it sounds crazy and it is crazy and and lyndon johnson did it but he'd spent all those years over in the house of representatives but to come in by the way lbj was i mean generally considered one of the most effective senate majority leaders i mean some people still wonder how he actually managed to take the vice presidency as such a step down and of course how history would have been different had he not but yeah yeah but the sort of sequence of events was i won re-election at the time there bob dole who is just an iconic leader as well and trent lott and and others were sort of the trent lot represented a younger generation but all very senior to me were sort of added to each other and competitive and sort of the intra family politics and class office sort of stuff and i didn't pay any attention to that really what i was interested in and i use this in different ways today now that i'm out of politics and if i'm on a board i like to go to the nomination committee that the future of a body of an institution if you really say how do i want to affect a board a non-profit board or a for-profit board or the united states senate 100 people the best thing to do is to get involved in the determination of who's in the room and who is not and therefore in leadership the sort of fourth or fifth position down depending on how you look at it in the republicans say there are about 50 republicans there is a more political position called the national republican senatorial committee but they're in charge of the 33 elections that one person is and they get selected by the body to choose the next generation of senators not choose them but you recruit them and you know i recruited lamar alexander i recruited elizabeth dole i recruited john thune maybe they would have ended up there but maybe probably for most of them they would not and so i ran for a leadership office then and that leadership again i did this one i came there to do policy to pass big stuff that would help people in health and welfare and lift them up in education so i said let's do that position for two years then i can come back and do policy the last four and so that year six years in between sixth and eighth year we did what you and plato you suggested earlier i ran that group i represented the united states senate in every state i had to raise money for the senatorial committee but we won that year 11 seats 11 republican seats it was the first midterm of george w bush as you said earlier there's a huge bias for the democrats to win right but 9 11 shifted it i'm sure you know it was it was all sorts of macro everything coming up but we won and we won big and so and i worked it hard and again i just being a heart surgeon not trained to do that sort of thing but i traveled and i recruited people and i'd go to new york i'd go to north carolina i'd go to nebraska i'd sit down with 10 people who wanted to run for the united states senate i'd spend hours with them i'd talk to their families and their spouses and say yes and say this isn't going to work out for you and then i have to raise money as well state to state and say this is important to support these campaigns and both parties have this is the expectation at that point that if you broke even that would be a victory to not give up in your first midterm no no you were going you were in it to win it yeah no well no the expectation was it's very unlikely to even break even the first midterm of any party of the president just you know just historically nine out of ten times lose his seats so i wanted to keep the losses to a minimum i wish i could say it was to break even but we won we picked up seats and with that i developed a certain credibility among my people people weren't jealous of me either because i'm just a doctor doing his best you know a good guy can bring people together can bring the democrat can be republican together but you know and by historical precedent not you know nothing great in the family started breaking down and without going into the details there was a lot of dissension in the party and it was mostly behind closed doors in these caucuses and when it came to elect the majority leader i again i didn't want to be a majority leader it wasn't my goal in fact if you go to be in leadership it's hard to do big policy it's hard to do the sort of things i ended up doing hiv aids pepfar these huge things that affect millions of people if you're the leader and you look at what mcconnell if you're whoever's the leadership schumer of mcconnell today and whoever it will be you know as people listen to this in the future they don't have time to do the legislation or the policy they're out there's managing they're hurting these cats being the leader so i didn't want to do that i only had 12. i only had four years to go i didn't want to spend four years herding cats but when it came down to the election there were five people who wanted to be a majority leader and all of them to be majority leader you had a majority vote and one might have 12 votes and one might have nine and one might have eight and one had four and six and then you get together with other people and i wasn't part of any of that but then it got down to where nobody had the votes and people came to me and i had a group of people because i'd come off these senate races with credentials they said well what about you and then all of a sudden all these all four of the other people came to me and said if you will do it they say i can't win and if you are interested we want you to be a majority leader so i'm really told that story publicly but i think it is important for people to it humanizes the place you know this is no different than elections in life and things are fair and things are unfair and luck is a part of it but that's it that's the story it did not have the credentials didn't want it did want the two-year job so i could go back to policy but the two-year job did well but got lucky really lucky and one and then at the end of the day because in part because of this doctor thing they also saw me as somebody that is non-threatening they said if this guy comes in i want to stay here forever they would say to themselves this is my job this is my pinnacle in life and my pentagon life is doing heart transplants you know right here out the window going to vanderbilt and saving lives every day by just doing my job and but this was the penalty life to a lot of people and so they probably said well you know if i give him my people and i work with him for four years when i leave i might be the one that he said should be the next majority leader as you alluded to earlier these next four years while your senate majority leader are quite busy and potentially one of the signature things you're a part of is pepfar which you've alluded to now i've always found it interesting how little americans understand pepfar and yet you know when you talk to people in africa it's a very different picture you get there right i mean i think when you go to the parts of africa that have been impacted by it they they hold the administration in such high regard and yet for some reason it doesn't get i think the attention it deserved domestically do you agree with my assessment and if so why do you think that might be the case i partially agree you know pepar let's start with telling people what it is yeah yeah we're talking about hiv aids and it makes sense being the only doctor in the senate that people would would come to me early on and i had spent years going to africa spending two to three weeks a year taking care of people doing surgery training people worked with a group called samaritan's purse initially and then other groups on my own and throughout africa mainly in south sudan and a province called the louis province there but also in ethiopia and south africa and botswana and i would see people dying there a lot and there was no testing for hiv aids at the time and then i came to united states senate and uh worked with president clinton and president clinton said yeah it's a big issue and we'd put maybe a couple hundred million dollars into it but never did anything about it and then this right wing not really right wing this middle but right-wing george bush came and president bush this is 2000 had never been to africa now maybe he'd been one time when his dad was president for a night in conversations with him and other people tony fauci who everybody's heard a lot about today was a huge part of it i bring pictures back of people dying of hiv aids but the story at that time was that three million people three million were dying every single year because of a little virus that in 1980 in 1981 we didn't know what it was we had never seen in the united states but with 3 million people dying of that and a couple of million dying of tuberculosis and one of malaria this was by far the biggest killer globally of a disease and so president bush basically listened to the stories focused on it sent tony fauci down to africa you know is this something we can do something about he came back in a surprise way at the state of the union missions 2003 when i was majority leader i knew it and probably five or six other people knew it basically said i'm going to make the single largest commitment to a single disease that's ever been made by a president of the united states this little kg virus hiv aids at the time republicans and faith-based people you know thought it was a disease of gays and was bad and the jesse helms of the world basically said it was you know a call from god and punishment and all the left wasn't doing anything about it but they talked about it but nobody would step so president bush i wrote the senate bill and i but a lot of others got together and passed this legislation about six months later in record time jumping ahead 20 million people are alive today because of that five page bill that surprised everybody coming out of this president and it's no small figure i mean we're talking you said you know clinton put 100 million into this i mean your bill put 60 billion dollars into this if i'm not mistaken is that right overtime we were spending about 200 million a year and again president clinton was right on all the issues and later after he left office as you know made a big issue about it and still has has done unbelievable things to the clinton foundation for it but at the time there were just so many other things going on so spending about 200 million and then that first year with president bush that we got it through the first year three billion dollars and then three billion dollars a year for five years and then over time is the 65 billion dollars because subsequent presidents have continued with that program coming forward but the interesting thing is it came from way out to the right and it came from a people who brought the left and the right together in a bipartisan way and when i brought it to the floor of the senate you know it was close but it was bipartisan and it passed and when the house passed it so it will be legacy and legacy changing and then the spinoffs from it or that money is spent it's not just on hiv agents on tuberculosis malaria infrastructure surveillance putting clinics in and cities and communities and villages and towns all over the world not just africa but russia china and around the world now one of the things that puts you at a little bit of odds with the party was when you broke with the party's views on stem cell research initially your view was in line with the republican party which was to be against stem cell research you changed that view and in the process presumably upset people in the party so i i guess i'd start with what changed your mind yeah you know it's interesting to sort of go through what stem cell research is because the changing of the minds or the switching of positions or sort of the role of a senator is one that's kind of worth going through so i i had come to this senate as a physician i know brain death well because all my donor patients i'm involved in all of those i am in immunology i when i came to the senate i was in and you know did things like disability policy and health so people came to me on this particular issue coming in and there was an amendment back in 1996 which basically banned federal funding of stems embryonic stem cell research not adult stem cells embryonic stem cells being the ones that were just discovered in 1998 so this is fairly new at the time and the beauty about those embryonic stem cells they do something that no other cell had ever done and that is you could take it it could become a liver or a heart or a you know pancreas you could kind of channel it in those directions and the second thing it was like a back in those days would say it's like a copying machine you can make unlimited copies of it no other cell ever in the history of man had we discovered so then you had people who said these cells are powerful going back to the heart transplant why not take a few of those stem cells stick it in the heart make that heart come alive the problems had never been done before and ethically people didn't know whether it can be done or should be done but if you had parkinson's disease neuro degenerative disease the hope for everybody including me as a scientist who kind of lived in this world was tremendous so the question was how do you take these embryonic stem cells and in an ethical construct allow that research to go forward and that was always the issue and do you do it with federal monies or you do it with state monies or local monies so the issue is all what happens at the federal level see that amendment and then president bush came out in 2001 and he said we're going to fund embryonic stem cells for the first time but we're only going to do very little we're going to limit it because we don't know if these cells are good or bad that's sort of one line the more important line at the time was is it ethical the embryonic stem cells the only way you could get them is by creating an embryo and then destroying the embryo so you can see real quickly where this is going you got pro-life pro-choice 50-50 in america pro-life people said that the embryo has the full genetic code it is all you got to do is nourish it it is a human it may be early on but it's in the first stage of development so the ethical issues there where americans believe that or half of america believes it has sort of moral value of some sort do you allow embryo meals to be created and so that's where the ethical issue a fascinating issue so bush said no we can't do that let's let's restrict the number of cells and he said here's 78 cell lines because they've already been created but let's not destroy any more embryos or create and destroy embryos and so he limited 78 lines so i endorsed that and about two months before that this was all written up in the wall street journal because it was all new science and political i had written gone to the floor of the senate and said i think that here's my 10 principles let's put them forward and engage federal funding state funding is okay and local funding is okay that's outside but for federal funding let's limit it like bush limited he limited to 78 cell lines i said instead of doing that let's sort of stay with the times and use these blastocysts of these little embryos that are used in fertility clinics that are otherwise going to be thrown away but they're still pluripotent these are still completely pluripotent stem cells exactly you create five of them you implant a couple the other three are thrown away discarded so my argument in my 10 principles that i went to the floor in 2000 was that used those so bush came out with something different he limited the 78 cell lines so i endorsed that because at least we were getting federal funding of stem cells and then we jump four years later this is what's really interesting uh to me and this is really important i think for our senators today science changes over time you learn things they're better techniques there's evolution of knowledge you clinical trials prove things and it got to be four years later that it was clear those 78 cell lines didn't work they were contaminated by mouth cells only about 22 of them ended up being good and therefore what was intended to be sort of a limited opening of the door for federal funding in my mind had failed because science had demonstrated those cell lines were not sufficient so i pulled my 10 principles back out again went back to the floor of the senate put those 10 principles out there and but the reason it became such a big politicized issue is that the president bush did not agree with me and and and the majority of the senate and the majority of the house we passed in 2005 a bill called the i think it was the stem cell research and enhancement act it passed it says you could you could use these blast assists an ethical construct was set up you got consent set up and then that bill passed overwhelmingly bipartisan but it was vetoed by by president bush and so then people said that frist and bush are in totally different areas but from the day one the embryonic stem cells to me i've been a heart transplant surgery where the most exciting science had come by in 10 years but when this whole ethical issue came up out of both my own beliefs you know when you have nascent life in an embryo and you had these embryo meals being created women were being paid 400 to create embryos to have them destroyed and there was no mechanism discipline mechanism around that that we had to create that it ultimately got created and now we jump you know 10 15 years later the same principles that i had put in in 2000 and 2005 are the ones out there and that's where that research has gone and in retrospect it's probably been pretty good in the sense that the stem cells eventually are going to live up to the promise but we're 17 years later and adult stem cells are used in bone marrow and and cord blood is being used that has no ethical issues around it it's these embryonic stem cells and with the resurgence out there it's you know 17 years later and some good things are happening but still there's no embryonic stem cells being used to treat the alzheimer's in parkinson's yeah i mean it's such a hard problem right the challenge is how do you instruct the stem cell where is the instruction set that says i want you to go and replicate 32 times 32 doublings and become cardiac myocytes and this subset of you are going to go on to develop purkinje fibers in this set of you will not i mean it's it's we we're still so far from cracking the code of what the instruction set looks like to the stem cell so it's this is step one of ten basically in in terms of that but it's hard to tell people that and as a policy maker you have to make the decision you have to set up the construct or you're not gonna fund funding but you literally have thousands of people who are dying and they have the chronic diseases and then they have a group of people telling them that within two years this was all in early 2000s within two years your parkinson's could be or your your neurological injuries severing of the spinal cord can be cured with these cells and therefore we need to open up the field and forget destruction of embryos or all these moral concepts of of life and that's a tough job of a policymaker you got you know 100 regular people there who you know some are smart some are not that are you know maybe not perfectly representative of people but they've got to make these decisions so you know it's the sort of thing that you know at the end of the day we increased federal funding for stem cells constructs were put around it imperfect his approach was different than mine people you know made a big deal about it at the time but you know at the end of the day i think it ended up working out pretty pretty well and learned a lot and it comes back to science a lot and these fields that uh are just so promising i mentioned synthetic biology and we think of crispr technology today and the creation of kids with blue eyes and brains that are good in math and all which we can could do but how do you slow that down how do you bring the discussions not just to the capital and not just to the academic centers but to to main street and get the right ethical constructs and that's what our policy is about i'm not a policy maker now in that sense but that's what these people in washington do that's what we hire them to do and that's what we need to hold them accountable and they need to do it the best way they can at a point a point in time so things are going to shift with time in that particular one i luckily i did the same 10 principles in 2000 as i did in 2005 when i passed the bill it got vetoed by the way so i lost but ultimately back under president obama the same bill was taken out and passed what are the restrictions on a president's ability to veto can a president veto any amount of majority any senate majority he can if the 99 senators are in favor of a bill the president can still veto it well yeah it's a good point because you if you could have a majority that votes for it or a super majority but you have to have two thirds or three points connection if you vetoed you have to take a whole nother vote and then override that veto so he or she has that intervening time to put you know pressure on people and and change that another very complex issue that you weighed in on which ties into your past which is this idea of end of life right i mean it's funny i remember a really complicated case when i was in medical school at stanford which involved a patient who was more or less brain dead but there was a very complicated family dynamic and i don't remember the exact details but it was one of those scenarios where every ethicist in the hospital had been in that room to try to talk to that family and resolve the withdrawal of support and interestingly even though this case had nothing to do with cardiac surgery ultimately the person that came in and mediated it was bruce wright's and it's an interesting story because again here's bruce writes at the time he was the chair of cardiac surgery at stanford he had by now come back from hopkins and you know him so this probably isn't surprising to you but you don't think of like the chair of cardiac surgery being the the warm fuzzy but he was like the most soft-spoken human alive like you you would never see him and think that that's the guy who did the first heart lung transplant or anything like that but it was sort of like i don't know he spent you know two hours with this family and everybody had come to a point of comfort that in the case of that patient support should should be withdrawn so of course as a transplant surgeon you are intimately familiar with what the criteria are for brain death what makes a donor what does not make a donor etc and so again here you are now senate majority leader and a very public case comes up this case of this young woman terry shivo and i guess just for folks who don't remember this this and you can correct me on some of the details but my recollection because i was in residency this was such a such a big discussion for us this is a young healthy woman who i guess unbeknownst to a lot of people had an eating disorder so she had bulimia and through lots of repetitive purging had developed profound hypokalemia so very low potassium so she's otherwise looks perfectly healthy on the outside but i believe her potassium got as low as 2 to 2.5 meal equivalents which not surprisingly put her into an immediate cardiac arrhythmia and arrest by the time the paramedics arrive and resuscitate her because she's so young and healthy they can get her heart beating again but her brain has been without oxygen for minutes no one really knows this was in 1990 if my memory serves me correctly fast forward a few years now her husband michael and her parents whose names i don't remember are basically having a different point of view about what to do and the husband believes you know she's going to be in a persistent vegetative state for the rest of her life this is not what her wishes were she's being fed through a tube the parents feel otherwise and it just keeps escalating its way through courts and it gets higher and higher and higher and higher i don't remember exactly how it got to the point where congress was now being asked to weigh in but maybe you can pick up the story of how this basically rose to a national story and frankly even potentially involve the us congress yeah it is a fascinating story this is one again and you know i haven't talked about a lot in part because it is complicated and you do need this sort of the time and we can do it very quickly but no no we don't have to do it quickly yeah yeah you know but no it is fascinating case and it because it has implications for everybody listening to us today everybody and it will be have even greater implications in the future as technology can do these miraculous things here it was miraculous in the sense that she could even be kept alive on a on a ventilator for a long period of time but increasingly it's going to get more complex because technology and science is going to give us these tools to use so lots of lessons in so it is worth going through it so you're exactly right 1990 terry shivo collapsed hypokalemia for just a persistent vegetative state is a medical term it's an important term here because the law uses it but for people who are listening to us you know you're on a ventilator and you can move and yeah open your eyes but it's just you have to be supported overall with both feeding tube as well as a ventilator and michael her husband you know did everything at least in my review at the time he took her to ucla took her to multiple centers and and for rehabilitation and then three years later in 1993 he'd given up basically and i don't know i wouldn't bother family now this is 10 years later that i got involved and but the issue was exactly as you described that all of terry's blood relatives the mother the father the brother the sister objected to michael putting her on a dnr or removing the tomb do not resist today or removing the tube so you had this dichotomy of walking the room just like you said bruce did you had on one side one person who by the law says if she's in a persistent vegetative state the husband can make the decision on the other side of the room you had all the mother and father who raised her who cared for her brother her sister who said no she's responding to us she's alive touch her feel her look in her eyes she recognizes us and so the parents and and michael disagreed on their impression they also disagreed because she had and this is what the implication is everybody listened to sort of this part she had nothing written down she had no living will no advance directive and therefore you had the parents and everybody says well of course she's a devout catholic and she she values life and you had the four of them saying you know we'll support her we'll take her financially will take care of it and then you had michael who by the law would have that responsibility of saying dnr or not i just want to interject there for a second i think it's such an important point you made and i had actually scribbled notes down to bring it up so i'm glad you did i don't think you and i as doctors could overstate the importance of an advance directive enough and i think a lot of these issues could be resolved if well you don't have to worry about it you go through this exercise i mean my wife and i did this 12 years ago sat there in a lawyer's office and spent an hour going through what we wanted and what we didn't want down to the levels of detail that is comical right now not everybody has the luxury they might not have the medical my wife's a nurse so you know we could talk about it through well this is i i would tolerate this many line changes at this many weeks of a trach and this feeding tube but it is very important i think to to do this and hospitals are getting better at it now for people admitted electively to at least have a box that you check that says do you have an advanced directive but i think everybody should have one of these things because the time to build the roof is when the sun is shining and the time to have this discussion is when clear heads prevail and it's hot it's hard you just have to do it people don't like to think about death or where they're going to be buried or wills this is one that out of respect for you for your loved ones and it plays out here and and i'll mention again because i'll come back to it because it had real implications but they had nothing the interpretation of one set of relatives and then the husband were very different so jump ahead seven years her feeding tube was taken out then a court these courts as you said came and came in and they replaced it at the time then 33 medical specialties and this is why i had to go back and review all this eventually came forward and had affidavits that her condition was not beyond some sense of recovery that she could improve and so seeing that you know complicates things a little bit because she's in this either minimally conscious state or persistent vegetative state so in 2003 the court ordered five doctors these are state courts ordered five doctors to to test terry two appointed by michael the husband and two appointed by the family and then one apported by the judge three to two they said she was in a persistent vegetative state it would be okay to withdraw therapy take the tube out take her off the ventilator the two who voted against that said no she's in a minimally conscious state and you can have can recover so she stayed alive for about six days and during this six days it became this huge global issue it went to the state of florida the state their equivalent of their house and senate the legislators got together and actually passed a law in that six day period that gave governor governor bush at that time the order to put the feeding tube back in all this is over six day period the supreme court there struck that down again this is kind of the politics and you say oh gosh as you said the bruce writes of the world these sorts of decisions as a physician and i'm talking about one who's run disability policy for america who's been in brain death who's been in the whole field of transplant whose whole career has been around life or death these decisions should best be made by a family with a directive with a physician or a caregiver maybe with a faith person in that room but this got elevated to throughout the politics you had pope john paul made a statement on behalf of the family and the sanctity of life and that they would support her and that was their belief the brother the sister the parents said keep her alive that they would support it financially and somebody gave two million dollars or said they would give two million dollars to support her so that's it so of course coming back being the only doctor in the senate and maybe it was one more at the time and knowing brain death i was involved in all those discussions and when i was at stanford the ethical issues the disability policy the only physician so i jumped didn't want to do it i don't think it should be done it should be really rare really exceptional but this had become a global issue on the news every night and again it was a long time ago at this point 2003. so i asked myself at that point does the government have the right to terminate life when the family objects to it if they'll financially take it and that was kind of what i where i came down to and the question is which part of the family do you listen to the one that the law would give it to ultimately it would be the husband or all of the siblings and the loved ones and the people who lived with her and taking care of her in large large part and it's a little bit like coming back to the transplant world if i walked into a room to remove a donor heart to bring it back to vanderbilt to transplant it and i walked in the room and the patient was there in the operating room and there was a spouse who said no he said take the heart it's okay but the rest of the family said no we don't want you to desecrate you know the body of our loved ones and take the heart even though the law would say i could do it you know under these donor laws that we have i wouldn't do it of course i wouldn't do it i wouldn't it's too you know to me it's just not the right thing to do so what did i do have you ever been in a situation like that by the way where the legal spouse the the person with the legal right to authorize the transplant says yes and a group of others say no it's fairly fair as you can imagine it's fairly kind it's rare but it's common and so no i did not i would not take off in the airplane tonight if i knew talking to the donor counselors up there that the family disagreed although legally it said so i avoided it totally and others may have have done it but i would not do it but yes it's not that you know you can imagine you get six members of a family and they all disagree about something unless you have a bruce rights walk out and you've described that well so the first thing i'll go faster the first thing i did is i called the last neurologist to examine her and he said she's not in a persistent vegetative state it's a mentally conscious state what is the difference there i mean i want to just kind of make sure some people understand what we're talking about she has some brain stem function for example if you touched her cornea she'd blink presumably if you injected ice water in her ears you'd get a doll's eye reflex did she have a gag reflex she had a minimal gag reflex which you know so she had the definition is not by a single test so it is a clinical test and there are certain tests that you just ran through three of them there are certain tests that you do but things like an mri and pet scan she hadn't had any of that she ultimately had him after after she died and she did have very very serious disease but it's a tough diagnosis and that's the world we live in oh so that ct scan that we see of her head that shows basically it's mostly fluid there's no brain matter that was post-mortem yeah after she had that was after because six months later because then it all surged up again as you can imagine so to talk to the neurologist he was just happy to be the last neurologist i personally as majority leader met with the brother it was it was clearly going to be coming to us the house had already sort of called for the case i talked to the family and the family said don't terminate her i looked at the medical records again just just because i was curious about it and it was clear that she had not had an mri had not had a ct scan had not done any of the current things remember this happened back in 1990 so i checked what i did it was there now and so i checked with the senate leadership harry reid was the democrat at the time became bipartisan a house led on a bill i'll come back to what the bill was and we had a bill and it was bipartisan supported unanimously in the united states senate overwhelming majority both parties in the house of representatives and 15 neurologists had signed an affidavit and all of that that said she needed an independent current evaluation that she hadn't been evaluated recently so really controversial even among my staff they said what in the world are we doing and i said i know you know but this has come to us and it's at an issue that it cannot be resolved and it i said it should be rare it should be decided locally the way you know for 20 years in medicine that i'd been able to decide life and death decisions which i was in this field that you do bill passed unanimously in the senate in the house i think it was like 210 to 50 something bipartisan what it did the bill itself guaranteed a process and not an outcome and so it basically didn't say keep her alive it basically said she needs an exam that is truly independent not with courts not done by politicians and once that exam is done if she's in a persistent vegetative state then remove the tube if that's what the husband wanted and if not the family should be listened to the extended family should be lifting to so the outcome it passed the united states senate it went to the federal courts they denied the petition and the feeding tube was removed and she was allowed to die so that's the story so it's an interesting one and on reflection you know again publicly i don't go through this and i've written some about it because i've written a lot about brain death issues and persistent vegetative state but as a policy maker it the story captures this sometimes necessary conflict and this very real tension between the rule of law and the law basically said well the husband can decide and this broader consideration of ethics and morality and in this world of increasing technology and the ambiguity of not having any sort of thing written down so in retrospect people ask me because a lot of people say that's got to be the biggest mistake you did in 12 years and i say i kind of just avoid it and move on but in in retrospect the fact it didn't come i'd probably do the same thing and pass the same bill set up a process and not an outcome and i was the only person in the senate at the time who had taken two oaths and one of those oaths was to the constitution the life of liberty pursuit of happiness the oath had all those 62 lawyers and everybody taking the senate but had also taken this other oath this hippocratic oath to protect life and to do no harm and when it's when there's ambivalence around that and when the family wishes otherwise and it's true ambivalence i will opt on life and i will opt on what i would interpret as life others may not and this has got to be exceptional and rare and it has been in retrospect and those kind of cases haven't made it back to congress and these decisions clearly clearly clearly are best made locally the other challenge i'll close on that is the politics made it worse because you had the chris matthews of the world who would go out every night and you know big sort of democrat and sort of after people and he would he would say here you have senator press press playing doctor in the united states senate you know he's one of those another republicans and then the republicans would shoot back from the house and say oh this is a great case because it shows right to life what i did and what i tried to do with these and it's hard to do is to separate the politics from the policy to separate the politics from the science and it shows this case shows that this inherent tension and challenge to our policy makers who are are whether it's at the state level or local level or federal level are given our trust to make decisions like this and to have appropriate oversight the decision should be locally though as much as possible yeah i mean i definitely agree with that my personal views notwithstanding on this case which is that i think that i can't understand how a ct scan wasn't done you know in the late 90s frankly to have you know made it so obvious as to what the state of her brain was i think the interesting point here is that you are probably the least political in my view in that because that's the advantage of being in your final term in a senate when you've publicly declared you'll never run for another office is you don't technically have a political dog in the fight anyway so even though your viewpoint was viewed as political i actually i think it was those were your personal views and people are free to disagree with them or agree with them but i i didn't think of it as necessarily a party view because you i don't think there's anybody in the u.s senate that had less of a stake in what the party felt that was just sort of you you were voting your conscience and we may disagree with that but i don't think it was political yeah and you know you know issues all issues and even with impeachment back in the past people have a hard time understanding that politics is is a part of our democracy and you wish and we think so partisan everybody wish not everybody but so many of us wish you could push this extreme partisanship out of it but think even things like impeachment there's a political nature to it it was intended to have this political thing and politics and policy can't be separated totally and that's why i come back to this tension that has to be there and this discernment and this past experience and not arguing you know the law to the extreme that you can't see a larger picture because laws are imperfect as well and that's the sort of representatives that i think we we need to aspire to and then elect and have people get involved enough in politics that they can elect those sorts of people to these bodies of congress to senate or governors or state assemblies it's so hard to believe that we are now in the 20th year since 9 11. i want to go back to that tuesday morning for you because i think anyone can remember you know anyone of a certain age can remember every detail of it but i can't imagine what it's like to have been a member of the united states government at the time let alone a senator what do you remember about that morning and what was running through your mind as this thing was unfolding i still have nightmares about it we all have the anxiety like we feel with you know covet and other things but the nightmares experience of having an assault that we have no idea how big it is how deadly it can be coupled with being in a position of having to make decisions at that point in time you're the united states senator the security at that time rest a hundred percent with the president and a co-equal branch of government the congress and with inadequate information no information having to make decisions there so the fright of it my first thoughts when when it hit i was out in front of the capitol and over another senator's office and the first plane hit and i fly and fly a lot and it'd be really unusual for somebody to hit a building world trade center but it could be done or it could be a suicide mission you even thought that during the first because when the first plane hit i remember i was in the trauma bay at hopkins and i remember someone coming in and saying it and i had just assumed it was like a cessna had hit on a foggy day did you know that it was an actual passenger plane no not at first i was in an adjacent room i was outside of the capitol in an adjacent room and somebody just said you know should you stop your meeting because the plane hit the cap same thing is what you said then when we figured out that it was an airliner and then shortly thereafter the second one hit i was in leadership at the time i was in the top five of leadership at that time doing the senatorial committee so at that level you get briefings beyond what other senators get and then when you're majority leader you give you different higher level briefings so i knew that a lot was going on in the world and that there was a lot of noise on the internet but not nothing that you'd think about but i knew the capacity that this wasn't just like a small thing this was really going to reflect the world and then when there were two always when they're two in life there's going to be a third in in these sorts of things and so that was it so my first thoughts were that the second was and at the same time and probably really first were my kids because my kids were in school over in washington over there where the vice president lives and it's near the cathedral and i knew if they're going after us to go after pentagon they're going to hit any sort of symbolic sites and that they went to school right there so of course concerning worried about them and then that was it then there was this long period of time where we got together and were shepherded to an off-site secure location and people are certain people in leadership that are identified so if there is an atomic bomb or if something happens we can refashion government so those people are taken to a secure location a few senators a few house members a few supreme court justices of the president or the vice president and i was not part of that particular group but it was at that level and it was as intense as anything in the surgery that had gone awry that i'd ever done it wouldn't panic there but this world of not having any information no intelligence essentially no intelligence and not knowing where it's coming from and not knowing what was going to sue over the next 12 hours it's different than anything in the at the operating room at the table and there you're doing life and death things every day this was different do you recall like what you went through over the next two or three days because i i mean i think back to it and i've been thinking a lot about as we approach the 20-year anniversary the stuff i want to talk about with my daughter who obviously was born after and in some ways it feels like it was yesterday because there were things about 9 11 i remember as though they literally happened a week ago like they're you know i remember exactly where i stood i remember exactly what the tv looked like i remember moments that evening because none of us left the hospital for two days you still were in a state of are there going to be people coming here do we need to be here and then there are other things that are a total blur so i can only imagine in your situation that's amplified you know 100x but do you also have sort of pockets of that period of time that are almost a blur or does everything still sort of fit you know nice and neatly and linearly into your recollection of the weeks that unfolded from that yeah i know it's an interesting question i think the difference was that we knew we had to act and the first thing that we needed to do quickly we didn't know if this was a single actor a single state a single group a country multiple countries and we didn't have the intelligence and so once we found out we didn't have the intelligence which was was pretty quick we had to pretty much assume that we're going to all be taken out and by us it's not us we don't matter but it's the united states of america so you go after new york you go after washington dc you destroy the congress you do you find the president so ours was how in the first six hours eight hours actually that night how we could display to the world that this is terrible and and unprecedented and has to be addressed and so we said how do you do that so we all stayed at the capitol we went to the front steps of the capitol and this is the sort of thing that does bring democrat and republicans together i mean really closely together and nothing else sort of matters we're talking about the safety and security of our country and maybe existentially the future of our country and so we went out and i remember obviously the the people you think are are who are there the leadership was there of course and the the people were there but the john lewises of the world you know spoke and we displayed to the world that that you can try to take us out but you can't take us out i think that was really important we did that after the anthrax attacks other attacks we sort of did that but i think it's really important to make that statement to the world to stand strong and then it was it was it was once we knew we could reconstitute government if something worse happened it really was this sort of systematic of up and run this is how much intelligence we have making decisions who should we hit how fast we should hit should we hit it all coming back if we hit what's going to come at us next so it was a busy time and then i had family as i said that that was always in the back of my mind just being in washington dc one of the things that you said that really stands out to me is the amazing lack of partisanship that existed for a brief window of time following the attacks of 911 and obviously you could say well it was an external attack directed directly at the united states but does it surprise you that a pandemic like kovid didn't have any of that effect of unifying the country there was i can't i can't at least politically it doesn't seem to have done anything to have unified people it's driven people further apart and yet it's an enormous existential crisis do you think this is different because a pandemic is not a nation-state and it doesn't affect the us exclusively i think when you can externalize your enemy or the assailant in some way brings people together you've got an image you can create an image there they're out there there's somebody there there's an embodiment of something that that is external to you that you can project towards and and receive sort of incoming on when you have the virus itself you don't have that because the virus is this cagey little thing that knows no borders that is truly global that does does not discriminate at all and there's no sort of externalization of that there's no sort of setting it up and putting it on the table and say saying let's do it i think the other the other big thing and there's no reason to get into the politics of it i think the leadership was different as well in our government the communication was very different and that to me has been the most disappointing when i look at the big assaults on our country that were on our soil here whether it was anthrax with 14 or 15 people dying here and hit our capital whether it is 9 11 and now the the pandemic my biggest disappointment has been the lack or maybe just the difference in the type of leadership that was demonstrated and it's leadership slash communication how things are articulated and and the like and i think that plays a big role i think that that if there had been a call to action with with appropriate communication leadership trust empathy understanding that this pandemic could have been externalized and we would probably have more rallying around it instead of this you know what you see on social media internet and television which continues to this day in 2005 you quite accurately predicted what we're seeing now you reference the 1918 spanish flu and you said it was not a question of if but rather a question of when we would experience another pandemic another virus specifically you very astutely pointed out that these 10 things are basically going to happen there's going to be complete and total social chaos there's going to be supply chain disruption boom boom boom and a pandemic preparedness strategy should include stockpiles of antiviral medications all of these other things it's easy to blame one party or the other but the reality of it is no administration's really ever taken that seriously have they people have taken it seriously i'd say both administrations have and this may come back to where we started that my experience coming in was colored by things like hiv aids killing three million people a year was characterized by anthrax which when it hit the capitol and knowing the potential of what it could do the lack of preparedness was just crystal clear to me just based on my my past experience and so what i did in 2005 is you said 20 different speeches i gave all basically off the same speech but i gave them on the east coast west coast silicon valley the floor of the united states senate far reaches like nantucket the red forest of california had everywhere it was essentially the same species you said it was it's called a manhattan project it did predict it was going to come because of this admixture of birds and animals and transportation around the world so it's clear it's clear from a medical standpoint and just to be clear you thought it was inevitable just from these factors not necessarily even bioterrorism i mean you were thinking no that would be another potential way but it was yeah okay yeah and i use the bioterrorism a little bit because i'd talk about that as well because you can intentionally manufacture any of this you hook it onto a virus or hook it onto smallpox where you have something that's real transmissible and it's not that hard to do it's real easy to do you can do it in a room eight by twelve foot room with you know with simple things and so the bioterrorism at the time because of of you know 911 and all the things that that had gone on uh it was clear we needed to worry about that especially with smallpox because russia had a supply of smallpox they could use but no this was outside of that this was sort of coupled with that because the same things that you need are the communications the infrastructure the stockpiling the virology the research and development the antiviral agents the manufacturing capacity all the things these are all the things that as i say them now people saying oh yeah check check check that's that's with code and the point is and i called it a manhattan project in each of these speeches and and as i said on the floor united states i left the senate the next year and work has been done and people have tried to do pieces of it but nobody has really stayed on it but the six proposals i testified before lamar alexander's committee about the next pandemic a month two about three months ago because right now is the time we have to talk about the next pandemic there will be another pandemic and will we be prepared and we all know and especially political people that you know it's only the snake that's at your foot that you're scared of once the snake goes off in the in the in the trees you just lose that sense of sort of urgency there so from the scientific standpoint i mean that wasn't any great i mean we say this like i could see it i wrote it down and i wrote what we should do and what we should do we didn't do and therefore it's you know it's interesting to go back my biggest fear is that you write that same talk and you give that same talk or somebody does and there's nothing done after that and you know i don't think that would be the case but it's going to take you know a constituents and people saying this is an existential threat this is you know this covert thing is is not a deadly virus i mean it's a dead doctor i say that i mean that's that's that's my fear right is we kind of and you say this and it sounds horrible but we dodged a bullet here this virus is quite a wimpy virus relative to the spanish flu or the hong kong flu or sars one or mers and there's a sweet spot obviously if a virus is so deadly that it basically knocks transm like if it's an ebola virus in many ways those are less threatening because they kill people so quickly but there's an inverted u-shape of lethality and sar's co-v2 is actually quite far to one side which is it's so non-lethal that it's so contagious but you take its lethality up one order of magnitude it still wouldn't especially if it has a long latency it's a devastating virus i mean it kills tens of millions of people and i i think you're absolutely right about the snake at your feet like there is a certain amount of political capital that probably exists now in 2021 to really say okay well what you know how much money is the government willing to spend to make sure that the next time this happens we're not on our heels yeah exactly and and it was funny with lamar's committee he ran the help committee was chair of it the health committee and he took a lot of heat i listened to it i love not being there because i can sit there listen to the hearing and give my testimony but you know half the people would say lamarr this is crazy looking for the next pandemic seeing what we should do we've got a pandemic now and he said well you know of course we do and we're doing everything we can but look what history has led us to and you know there are clearly things to do but how you get people to stay on it and understand and it they're simple things infrastructure right now the you know things like vaccine distribution which has been so challenging you know that's the sort of thing and public health infrastructure locally there are fewer public health people on full-time payroll in our communities today wherever you are right now than there were eight years ago public health people it's public health has been the the step child of health and welfare and healing that is it's inverted now and people appreciate it but we can actually deliver on it not just next year and not just put more funding in it but really do it over a period of time and that's that's the challenge and again why getting people to these bodies and opening those bodies up to whether it's more scientists more thoughtful people people getting other experiences from life and having them participate and supporting them in those positions so i want to kind of go back to just this broader topic of the political world we live in today versus the political world you entered and left which is in some ways not that long ago but yet seems like an awful long time ago frankly if you think about the historical arc of politics which i frequently try to do and think back to the worst of times and maybe this isn't so bad but help me understand you gauge your level of optimism for me in terms of this infrastructure right which is the two-party system the systems that are in place that have rewarded the extremes and punished the compromisers the tools that amplify it social media cable news all these other things that that we could everybody can rattle off all the things that could be broken today how optimistic are you that if we can both agree that where things are today is sub-optimal it's going to get better yeah you know i i um on my podcast i ask people the sort of the optimism question a lot and 90 out of 100 say they're optimistic about things that's really interesting and and so i'm slowly going to answer it because i think you have to be really really careful on the first of all i am optimistic and again it's my nature and i tend to get involved in things that seem to be challenging and i i love just working with them and bringing people in and things tend to work out pretty well so i feel good about it i think the next few years are going to be really difficult and probably not get a lot better and make it worse i think if you look at structures that are contributing to it we're going to figure it out and i don't blame social media but it's an accelerant and the way you know we are going to figure out in some way to curate social media in a way that still allows you know freedom of expression and free speech but where it can't be used in the negative ways whether it's in partisanship or misinformation i feel good about that and part of it in discussions with with people in the sort of facebook direct world in the amazon world and the google world and the the the netflix world it's going to take a little bit further i think we're going to get better there when we get better that will produce a much better standard because if we're still on the curve of getting worse and it may get worse in other you know this world populism it may get a little bit worse but it will get better and i'm optimistic about that leadership i think it's going to take a while i'll tell you just a real quick story when i when i was in the senate things are partisan again we don't want to idealize the past but president bush and president clinton did not do this as much but president bush came in and we were in sort of this you know 9 11 sort of a world but came in and every other friday would take three people from the senate leadership or for two republicans to democrats and from the house leadership and and every friday do breakfast with them quietly no press right off the oval office and it was uncomfortable you'd have the i shouldn't mention anything but you have the people who are the leaders around the table and you know people like nancy pelosi and president bush sitting side by side for breakfast for an hour there's a little bit of attention there but i and this was before the iraq war and things got really complicated in in so many ways but but for that period of time things seem to be so much better really uncomfortable and people i don't know if people have talked about that either but what i i say that and preface that because i do think if you have a president of the united states president obama didn't do it and president trump didn't do it president biden it looks like he would do something like that but you know you just don't know but i do think if you had at that level not at the level of chuck schumer and and mitch mcconnell you know it's too ingrained there but at that level you pulled people together and said i'm willing to lose my next election as president united states and again take take president biden or president-elect soon to be president biden out of it if you had somebody like that who stayed with it it would make a difference it gives cover for people below it gives cover for the majority leader and and the minority leader and the speaker and the democratic leaders in the in the house and that's not that hard i mean that kind of makes it sound simple to do but sort of my experience in my thoughts it could be as easy as that to begin to turn the tide and i think we'll we'll see that i don't know if it'll be in the short term or long term or how long people be around but it takes that sort of courage to do it to say i would you know i'm willing to sacrifice a second term or something like that that's a big sacrifice though isn't it i mean that's not something to take lightly yeah it is but you know we've gotten to the point that you know how you elect somebody who really will do that from a very partisan group it makes it hard but it's doable and we're talking about regular people and and people who you know can be reasonable and not always it depends on the individual but for those two reasons i i'm optimistic because i think it can be done i think it probably will be done but i and it can be done pretty quickly i think there's a real call from people for this sort of bringing people together doesn't mean sacrifice your principles it doesn't mean sacrifice your party it just means come to the table and be able to have a discussion and have a disagreement and leave you know as we did sort of more in my first term than in my second term in the senate sort of shaking hands after you have a big debate on the floor of the senate you know there's so many other things i wanted to chat about and we're really we've gone a lot longer than i thought we would to this chapter but we really have only covered a couple of the chapters of your life there's an entire chapter that follows what you did in the senate which is in some ways the busiest chapter of your life in the last 15 years i guess just for the sake of brevity what has been the most interesting project you've worked on because you've you know you're you're doing venture capital you're on the board of for-profits not-for-profits you're a part of the bipartisan policy center which is an organization i'm quite familiar with and quite impressed with i mean your commitments span so much what has been the most interesting and i guess what have you brought from the two previous chapters to it yeah that's a great question because people it's a little bit like they look at you probably if you look at your past they you know you've done different things and you've tried different things and is there any sort of narrative or thematic that sort of goes through that and for me it goes back i'm sure to this whole image of healing and health and hope and all and you know it sounds a little bit gimmicky and all but it does come back to that in my mind learning to be a doctor sort of practicing the transplant world that was 10 years learning in 10 years delivering and then 10 years and 12 years in politics and then 10 years in sort of the private equity world and and then the last five years in in venture capital all of it's around health and healing everything i do everything and so what i did when i left the senate i said now what is the next step i you know smartly said 12 years in in the senate so i said putting together my past experiences what if there's one thing that could be done to change the course of history i think this is thinking big and it's not the sort of thing you tell anybody at the time what would it be and you know based on 20 trips to africa and the global experience and all and hiv aids globally and i came back to one thing and it was k through 12 education and globally probably k through 12 education for girls and if you're going to spend you know a increment of time with my experiences where would it be so what i did is started a foundation it's called state collaborative on reform of education it's by far the biggest in the state now i started but got really smart people and good people dedicated people to run it and with that it has had an impact where tennessee has for the last 10 years shown dramatic dramatic improvement in k-12 education and been recognized as such so that is is a little bit out of health care but the nexus between health and education is so real the the health feeding into being better educated the more educated sort of better health it just feeds together and i i see it and you know the data is is good so that's sort of the one big bucket that i made a conscious decision if you look in the investing world what i do is focus on mission directed health service companies not pharmaceutical companies not molecules not devices not you know all of that and so i i start around companies i start companies and support companies that have a mission of taking people usually vulnerable populations and lifting them up and the one that i'll just mention because you asked for one is one that kind of comes back to the things we've talked about is palliative health care in our country today most people do not die the way they would want to die hospice the last seven days four days three days is really good in america finally after you know 50 years is really good but in this world of chronic disease where people are are living and as you describe so well in in your talks you you push that down slope on the chronic disease and aging out as far as you can but at some point you come to those grafts that you you draw and you're going to bring things to a close and it's chronic disease so think of it at that last year of life that last eight months of life and it's called palliative health care in hospitals traditionally if you're at vanderbilt or stanford or mass general or your local hospital of people listing today you can get good palliative health care but if you live 30 miles away or 50 miles away or 100 miles away you can't and you're sitting there with a chronic disease you're going downhill your family if you have family local that don't know what to do and so what we did is create from scratch a company that focused and is now the largest palliative non-hospice related palliative health in communities in the country and it started with with this full circle sort of thing it started with when i mentioned i had hundreds of people being referred to me back in those early transplant years right over here at vanderbilt they were coming in but i could only transplant one every four or five days i didn't have enough donor hearts so i had 50 or 60 people coming in who are going to die within six months flying in coming in saying we need a transplant and i say i don't have enough donor hearts and so i had to learn how to take care of them prolong their life and getting the stuff right the nutrition right the exercise right the mental health the spiritual health right all of a sudden they started living not just six months you know they wouldn't come here the doctor hadn't told them it was gonna be six months but they lived eight nights nine months 12 months so seeing that and then i lost my mind and went to the senate and then i got out of the senate i came back and we're still in the same place nobody had developed a palliative health care system for the last year eight months of life that looked at the spiritual that looked at the mental that looked at the nutritional that looked at the exercise and and and sort of general acute care medical care as well and so that's sort of a good example of the sort of companies that that i believe in it ties things together there are needs that are out there there's lots of other areas you know like that out there in the area of the frail elderly today who don't need palliative care is doing another company right now just a year old because they've got social determinant 35 000 of that cost plus 35 000 of medical costs but nobody's put all that together to treat them holistically so those are the sort of examples that are exciting to me that are really no different than the innovation of the new ideas and the execution which is most important of doing a heart transplant and figuring out how to you know some way figuring out that cardiac biopsy to to determine inflammation and and then developing a new drug like cyclosporine which revolutionizes that field it's doing it in the business world where you have access to capital you can move fast you're not slowed down by government so it's pretty pretty exciting bill if ever there was a renaissance man you are that man and i i still think in many ways i know you don't agree with the idea of term limits and maybe that's not the answer but there really is something to be said for having people in the government who haven't spent their entire lives in government and i don't know i think the trajectory of your career was very interesting and maybe we'd all be better served if
