## Transcript

[00:00:00] Well, let's talk about that that final thing. What is what is that what does that last 24 to 48 hours look like? So, the phrase we use is active dying to to distinguish it from the rest of living dying. And the body is, you know, is actively shutting down. So, system by system uh you know, you'll stop your kidneys will shut down. You're not making as much urine in part because you stopped drinking probably a few days ago because your body couldn't handle the fluids.

[00:00:28] So, and thanks to kidney shutting down, you get a buildup of toxic metabolites and and get a little intoxicated, a little dreamy, a little that may be the course of that may be the the mechanism of your delirium. Um, so you're not eating, you're not drinking as a general rule. You're probably a little fuzzy if and or entirely asleep. Um, breathing.

[00:00:51] So the sort of the two biggies, those can happen anywhere along the way, but the ones that tell you you're really close are when you have modeling of the skin, a sort of lacy bluish experience where your body's just not moving blood effectively and you'll see skin changes and especially at the extremities and breathing patterns um change. Um often times you get apnneic, so long periods of no breath at all. um you often hear something that's like a frightful phrase, but the death rattle um so which often is sort of a a um a gurgling sound with breathing.

[00:01:26] That's just because your your oral fairings is no longer the reflexes are dying out. So you're no longer moving fluids as they pull in the back of your throat, which is an important note there. If your if your reflexes are no longer functioning, you're not likely feeling it. So a death rattle sounds pretty gnarly. It's but it's generally probably harder for the audience than the person dying. But those are the things that you that are typically experienced in a body that's actively dying and that's only going to last a matter of days at most hours to to a day or two.

[00:01:59] I think the other thing that's happening is the experience for the people around that person, right? And um there's so much to say in that space. But I do think having you know counseledled a lot of people there is there's a feeling of preciousness right we don't know when that last breath is going to come we we you know maybe we really want to be there maybe we feel like we can't but um often for someone watching and waiting um it can be really hard to stay connected to our own experience. So like people won't get up and go to the bathroom because they don't want to miss that moment.

[00:02:37] They won't eat. They don't eat. Maybe their appetite is low anyways, which you know is fine, but it is a time to be thinking about really basic needs and basic comforts for everyone in the space. Um because that influences the space and the environment for for all. And most people feel like this is the dying person's experience. This is like all of the focus is there. We're watching every respiration. We're even matching their breathing. We're creating anxiety in our own bodies because of that. And if we can invite attention to everyone's experience and give permission to like, you need to take a walk, go take a walk.

[00:03:14] It may mean that they die when you're not in the room. And maybe that's okay. Um maybe they die in the one minute you're going to the bathroom for the first time in 6 hours. Like it may just be that way. That's a really really important point sort of like once you understand delirium and so you can contextualize what you're hearing from a loved one that point Bridget so is pointing to is such an important one a lot of loving families keep these vigils and don't sleep don't do anything so that they can be there for the death thinking that that's the most that's the high that's what it means to be there when someone dies is in that exact moment when they take their last breath and so to Bridget's point this is a lived experience for everyone so you got to keep doing you have to sleep, you know. Yes. And um it just I I don't think any of us could tell you why this is, but it is just a thing. You talk to anyone who worked in hospice for a while, it seems to be that a lot of people need to be alone for the final their final moments on the planet to really let go. And so it's almost it's I

[00:04:22] I can't tell you why, but it is a thing. So you going to the bathroom or taking a walk or stepping in the room may be exactly the thing that that person needs to finally let go. So the message is don't leave and therefore the person will never let go. You're just potentially can make it harder and harder for that person to actually finally let go. So go to the bathroom, take a walk, kiss the person goodbye, drink some water, and know that not only they may they may be gone when you come back, but that may be exactly what they needed to finally let go.
