In this episode, Tom Catena, a missionary physician who runs Mother of Mercy Hospital in the Nuba Mountains in Sudan, describes some of his extraordinary work as the only doctor in a remote, war-torn region of Africa. In terms of individual lives saved, you could argue that there is no other person on the front lines doing more than Tom. Additionally, we explore the manner in which the Nuba people die, which is in striking contrast to the ubiquity of chronic disease and self-harm in the West, despite the extreme poverty and unimaginable suffering experienced by the Nuba people. Lastly, we discuss the lessons to be gleaned from the Nuba people, who, despite their suffering, live so harmoniously, happily, and resiliently.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this powerful episode featuring Dr. Tom Catena:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Tom Catena, a missionary physician who has served in Sudan's Nuba Mountains since 2008, providing medical care to approximately 750,000-1,000,000 people. The discussion covers his experiences as the only surgeon in a war-torn region, dealing with casualties from bombings, managing a hospital with minimal resources, and the stark contrasts between life in Nuba versus developed nations. [00:02:00]

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Hospital serves 750,000-1,000,000 people in an area the size of Austria [00:48:11]
- Hepatitis B prevalence of ~20% in general population [00:48:25]
- HIV rate less than 1% in the region [01:43:08]
- Common diseases include malaria, tuberculosis, and trauma from warfare [01:30:42]
- Limited diagnostic capabilities - recently acquired X-ray machine, basic lab tests [01:30:11]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Focus on essential needs rather than material possessions [02:00:58]
- Maintain strong community bonds [00:57:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Immediate vaccination for Hepatitis B at birth for exposed infants [00:48:11]
- Treatment protocols adapted to minimal resources [01:30:42]

**4. Notable Quotes**:
"Preach always and sometimes use words" - attributed to St. Francis, referenced by Dr. Catena [02:06:35]

"When you're really gripped in this struggle to survive... your mind doesn't drift off to other things" [02:35:16]

**5. Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can modern technology be better leveraged to support remote medical care in conflict zones?
2. What systems could be developed to improve medical supply logistics in restricted areas?
3. How can the global medical community better support isolated physicians like Dr. Catena?

The episode provides a profound perspective on practicing medicine in extreme circumstances and the contrasts between healthcare delivery in developed versus developing regions. Dr. Catena's work exemplifies both the challenges and rewards of providing medical care in resource-limited settings.

[00:00:05] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA this podcast my website and My Weekly Newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness and we've established a great team of analysts to make this happen it is extremely important to me to provide all of this content without relying on paid ads to do this our work is made entirely possible by our members and in return we offer exclusive member only content and benefits above and beyond what is available for free if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription if you want to learn more about the benefits of our premium membership head over to Peter AA MD /s subscribe welcome to a special episode of the drive for this week's episode we're going to be rebroadcasting my conversation with Dr Tom Katana which was originally released in February of 2019 prior to interviewing Tom I had known about him for three years but this interview was the first time I met Tom in person and it's actually the first time in my life that I was ever nervous prior to meeting another human being of course this is incredibly ironic because when you meet Tom and this of course will come across in the episode he is quite simply the most humble person you can imagine but I see in Tom what I consider to be the greatest of any qualities or characteristics in a person and it really humbled me to meet him that day and to continue to get to know him better and better over the years since that time since about the year 2000 Tom has been a missionary physician in Africa initially working in Kenya and then in about 2008 he moved to a reg of

[00:02:00] South Sudan called The nuba Hills or the nuba mountains where he continues to take care of about 3/4 of a million to a million people at the time he was the only physician in the area and there's a single Hospital there it's hard to describe how few resources he has to run it this is something he'll explain in the podcast it's really nothing short of a miracle as an update to Tom's work after several years of relative calm

[00:02:24] Sudan is again besieged with conflict this time there is fighting between factions of the government this Civil War has inflicted widespread damage across the Sudanese health system however even with all of this Tom's hospital is still functioning and caring for the wounded not only that but the hospital now has its own clinical training school which has 19 physician assistant students and 30 Midwife students in 2008 when the hospital was founded there were 15 staff members including Tom and a few expatriate

[00:02:55] Catholic nuns and the local nuba were not formally trained at the the time as of today there are 270 staff and over 50 formally trained nuba health workers including nurses pharmacists laboratory technicians and anesthetists and the first woman doctor from the besieged area of the nuba mountains is now also working with Tom in my conversation with

[00:03:16] Tom we talk about a lot of things we cover some of the unimaginable suffering that he sees and how he himself copes with death and copes with being in a situation that I certainly don't think I could be in and I suspect many of you listening would relate to that we talk about a crisis of purpose I think it's easy to look at what Tom does and feel sorry for him or feel sorry for the people that he serves but I must admit I came away from this interview actually feeling more sorry for us in a way and

[00:03:41] Tom so eloquently without judgment explains some of the differences between people with all the privilege in the world like most of us listening to this and the people that he serves we also talk about the sense of community that exists in nuba and what you start to realize is that the way we die in this country and the way that we live in this country is so different from from the way that people live and die in other parts of the world it's not surprising that people there don't die from complications of type 2 diabetes but instead they die from infectious diseases and Trauma there's also a more subtle Point here which is that we are in many ways prisoners of our own world and our own mind and our own possessions

[00:04:16] Tom's work is so important to me that I want to be sure anybody listening to this can get access to all the notes that we're going to put together on this topic and as such for this episode the show notes will be free and available to everyone including those who are not subscribers lastly and perhaps most importantly if anyone is curious about how to support Tom and his amazing work we will have a link at the top of the page of the show notes where you can give directly to the work Tom does my wife and I have been giving to Tom for about six years now and I can say that it is unquestionably the highest Roi money that we contribute to any cause in other words for every dollar we give we really have a sense of how it's being used used and how it is changing lives so without further delay please enjoy or potentially re-enjoy my conversation with Dr Tom [Music]

[00:05:12] CA hey Tom thank you so much for making the time to come over here today sure Peter my pleasure few yeah there are a few people that would be giving up more that they deem important work than you so I I know I know your time is is tight how often do you come to the US well this is my first time out in more than three years so last time I was in the US was November 2015 I was here for about 5 days I was in my hometown of Amsterdam

[00:05:36] New York and it wasn't much of a trip I was you asked about malaria I was sick as a dog with malaria so I was like in bed with malaria the whole time the last day I felt a bit better just in time to go back to Africa so it's been it's been a long time since I've been back you grew up in Upstate New York yep your pedigree is like the star right you went to Brown you played football you went to

[00:05:56] Duke Medical School right at what point did you realize you wanted to do something a little different Visa working you know outside of the US for example this desire to do this kind of work really was planted in uh when I was in college when I was at Brown and I always wanted to do some kind of mission work and that term has several connotations but I you know I wanted to be a missionary whatever that meant I wasn't quite sure what meant at the time but I just had this idea I wanted to work in other cultures other Society do

[00:06:23] Mission work but I was as you a mechanical engineering major and that didn't really fit with do we Mission work this was in the 1980s and most of the jobs then were in the defense industry they were you know they were good jobs but I didn't really want to do that kind of work so I graduated college and kind of floating around for a while was offered a job by

[00:06:42] GE working with their were kind of nuclear submarine program it would have been a really good job but I just wasn't interested in that kind of work and I remember one day it was kind of odd I was coming back from my great ants funeral I was with my brother Felix and idea just kind of popped in my head I should go into to medicine because I could if I do that then I could do

[00:07:02] Mission work and you know I'd like the Sciences I could stay in the Sciences do Mission work help people just kind of that general idea and ended up going to medical school and kind of kept that desire to Mission work and that kind of evolved into wanting to work in Africa work with people that don't have a lot of options for healthcare you know 15 years later ended up in Sudan so you started out in Kenya is that right right so you know when I finished at medical school then I did five years in the US

[00:07:29] Navy I didn't have a scholarship for medical school so I had to pay that time back then went to my residency I did Family Practice in Tero Indiana now it was time to kind of be free and do what I want so I thought well let me just go and let me do this thing that's been kind of an itch for so many years so I uh teamed up with Catholic medical

[00:07:46] Mission board and I and they said okay we have an opening in Kenya at this Mission Hospital maybe go there I said okay I'll go for one year I'll see how it goes if I like it maybe I'll stay longer otherwise maybe I'll just come back and start a practice and went down the canyon and fell in love with the place and decided to stay what was the first thing that you remember when you got there as far as how different this was from the way you had trained because you did your residency in the United

[00:08:08] States right right did my residency in the US and I did Family Practice and the program I went to was kind of geared towards rural health so I thought okay if I want to do admission medicine I got to be doing more than just kind of outpatient office stuff I need to do something a little more a little more meat to it so you know a little bit of obstetrics we did a bit of surgery mostly just these sections so when I first got there I think what struck me was just the volume of patience I mean I was a resident and you know in clinic days we'd see like five or six patients you know and get all every little detail down in each one and now I'm in this rural Hospital in Kenya and I mean you're seeing 50 60 patients you know huge numbers the clinic the the wards are full you go do a ward round I was in charge of the adult Ward and there were you know at the time I thought it was a huge may like 30 40 patients there and I was responsible for all them it's just the sheer volume of patients you had to go through every day in the variety of diseases so not only the tropical stuff which I I didn't know much about I mean here's malaria TB leishmaniasis all this kind of stuff I had no idea about I had to learn about when I was there you know learned there were thank God some couple more senior doctors there that I could learn from but just a volume of patients and the variety of diseases you had to face so what year did you get to Kenya I arrived in Kenya uh January 17th 2000 that's so interesting I I arrived at NIH when I was in medical school on January 17th 2000 no way yeah yeah that was uh which was NIH being at NIH while I was in medical school was one of the sort of more formative parts of my experience so how long before you went to Sudan and what led to that transition I'm trying to think of my geography right Kenya is south of Sudan correct sort of south east of Sudan South right South and a bit east exactly okay and and much more stable right I mean Kenya's a a relatively safe place to be right Sudan is not right it's divided into these provinces and my the one that got all the attention was darur which is the furthest west correct correct exactly and that basically was a war zone right

[00:10:15] I mean a killing field right so Bashar was basically killing his own people there wasn't he right so to go from Kenya to Sudan what were you thinking I think maybe the the Modo Sanda in my life was always looking for what's the opposite of greener pastors I'm looking for Browner pastors when I was there in Kenya this was uh as I said I got there in January 2000 the Civil War in Sudan was really raging at that time and I was in Kenya learning a ton of stuff really enjoyed the work and I kept hearing about Sudan the Civil War in Sudan and how it's so terrible and the conditions there were were terrible and the you know there's such a lack of of any kind of Health

[00:10:52] Services I thought man I'd really like to get involved in that in that struggle just to go and and work with the Help the People there just cuz it was so Health Facilities were so limited I thought that's kind of the place I want to go to so I had this General thought this is 200 2001 2002 now this in June of 2002 I left my first posting which was in a rural place called motoma was there for two and a half years I went up to Northern Kenya place called turana I was at the Kaka Mission Hospital which is up in the K turana desert near the refugee camp a woman named Dedra burn so didy was her I think her first time up in tana and I was talking to her she's an American she was doing a kind of short-term Mission there she's a a surgeon and a family practice doctor she did both but doing primarly surgery and she said look there's a bishop I know who's Bishop M GIS who's building a hospital in Sudan I think he might be interested in going there and that like whoa that's exactly what I've been thinking about doing you know for the past couple years so back in 2002 so she said look he's got an office in Nairobi he's living there in Exile maybe you can make contact with his office because I was due to go to Nairobi and start working there anyway to make a long story short I ended up working in

[00:11:56] Nairobi linked up with his office and uh we started kind of making plans for the hospital and how to how would it run staff we would need all that kind of stuff and then took six years but six years later who funded the hospital it's all funded through the Catholic dasis I see so it's Catholic dasis of elade

[00:12:11] Bishop gasis was the bishop of the elade dasis and he and his office were able to get funding through the through the church mechanism to fund the hospital so now it's 0809 and and that's when you go right so I went to newba mountains arrived there March 10th 2008 was the day I landed there tell the listener a little bit about where nuba is I mean I know it's in the southern part of Sudan it's to the east of darur right but it's pretty rugged country isn't it right so uh Thea mountains is probably one of the most remote places in the world it's a region which for many years in Sudan was kind of kept off limits before when Sudan was a kind of a colony it was under the called the Anglo Egyptian condominium partly kind of admin administered by UK and by Britain and by by Egypt they decided to kind of keep the nuis separate they look these people have a unique culture are unique people they didn't really allow a lot of open tourism or or people to go in there was kind of a closed area so they really kind of have maintained this separateness and this isolation over over centuries it's difficult to reach it's semi-arid it's got It's got a distinct rainy season it's got a dry season but more Hills they aren't really high mountains but sort of uh you know 3,000 foot hills that kind of that kind of range my history is not great but I sort of remember that basically Sudan was granted sort of I forget the term but when you're given your Independence for lack of a better word that would have been in the 50s right right 566 yeah and and then what was the religious sort of map of Sudan and did that figure into how it was divided and was that partly why nuba was was it religiously diverse was it mostly Muslim mostly

[00:13:52] Christian yeah you know Sudan is a it's a very interesting place so you've got it was one country up until 2011 when they divided North and South now the religious makeup is in the north so north of nuba mountains it's primar Muslim almost all Muslim in the north the south is primarily Christian nuba is right in the middle and interestingly enough nuba is a mix it's about let's say half Christian half Muslim and everybody's an animist but half our

[00:14:17] Christian half are Muslim and the nuba are unique I think a unique tribe in the world where you have families which are mixed have nuba you have nuba Muslims and nuba Christians and they there's no conflict amongst them for instance my wife is is inba her father both her parents when they were born they were just followed the traditional religions the the Christianity and Islam had not been introduced yet into the area now as they got older her father became Muslim mother became Christian they married her father's a polygamist so two wives both wives are Christian their oldest son is a Muslim the rest of the children are

[00:14:52] Christian and nobody's really bothered by this that's in nuba now the country itself this difference between Muslim and Christian was was really a big issue in the previous Civil War you know we had sort of the Southern African people that were mostly Christian against the northern Arab people that were all

[00:15:09] Muslim fighting each other and there was very much a religious context to that previous Civil War and also in nuba mountains the nuba mountains the nuba people join the southerners they're all African in nuba they join the southerners fighting the northern sort of Arab Muslim people in the north and in the 1990s there was a Jihad against the nuba people so there was a real genocide in the 1990s against the who who issued this Jihad the ideologue behind this is a guy who just died last year his name is Hassan Al tabi and uh tabi was a member of the

[00:15:43] Muslim Brotherhood very bright guy went to sbone in Paris and was kind of intellectual but really kind of a kind of an evil genius if I can use that word he was a real idealogue in the Muslim Brotherhood and he managed to convince some of the imams in the North to sign off a fatwa to allow Jihad against the nuba and many imams rejected it they said you can't you can't do that it's you know even though he'd be killing

[00:16:06] Muslims within nuba right exactly his response to this was okay you can have a Jihad because the Christians are are fair game in the Jihad and then the Muslims are apostates from the religion because they associate with Christians some of them eat pork some of them drink bcal beer they're not real Muslims like this thing with the nuar very much communal and to have Muslims and

[00:16:25] Christians together at functions it was nothing but to him the fact we could have Christians and Muslims in the same family was a huge Scandal to him he just couldn't tolerate that kind of stuff so he said no these guys are also fair game because they're not real Muslims so what year was that fatwa issued that was in the I think in the early 9s would been 934 so Basher was already in power right his coup was like late 80s right he took power in ' 89 okay and this guy tabi helped him in this coup he was kind of the brains behind the coup and tab I mean he was you know he's he was kind of a power hungry guy he said okay his fig he figured if he helped Bashir get into

[00:17:04] Power Bashir was a military guy and he thought okay if I help Basher get in the power I'm much more intelligent than Bashir I'll just kind of find a way to get rid of him and I'll take over and Basher said look I'm the one in power you're not you're not taken over so he kind of always kept uh tabi at a distance and there always these he would always he was always throwing tabi in prison afterwards because tabi started speaking out against him so put him in a quote unquote prison maybe you know live in some luxury apartment in cartoon but they kind of were at odds with each other but tabi was the ideologue behind a lot of this movement he's the one that invited Osama Bin Laden to Sudan in the early 90s so Bin Laden lived in when Bin

[00:17:37] Laden was exiled from Saudi Arabia which yeah in the early 2000s right well that was before then he invited uh what's his name he invited Bin Laden to carum so he lived in Sudan for a while and a lot of you know alqaeda had a lot of training camps in the desert in the north of Sudan I had totally forgotten that fact that's the chapter of al-Qaeda that i' sort of

[00:17:55] Forgotten so you basically have a bunch of incredibly evil people who are deciding to kill their own citizens effectively right you got there in 08 you said or 09 08 so he arrived March 2008 so historically that was the interim peace period so since they got independence in 1956 Sudan's been a civil war various parts have been a civil war for almost the entire history that's you that's 60 that's how many years 62 63 years most of the history they've been at Civil War so this was one of the brief periods actually wasn't even PRI them because Dar for started 2003 Dar for Rebels started fighting against the government 2003 so this wasn't the whole country was not at peace at the time but the big war between the South and North the peace agreement was signed 2005 so when we arrived 2008 the peace agreement was still in effect and there was no active fighting and then we were kind of waiting for this referendum to take place the referendum the way the peace agreement was signed up was Southerners so South Sudan would have the choice for self-determination and that would be done by referendum so the people actually have a vote straight up vote if the majority vote to succeed they suceed majority vote to stay and stay as one country they stay now 2011 they have the vote and like 99.99% vote to secede from the north so

[00:19:15] South City in separates in the peace agreement I'm sorry is nuba considered south or north in this cessation right this is part of the problem because in the peace agreement nuba was separate okay and what they said was okay South Sudan will have a referendum the nuba mountains was not included as part of

[00:19:29] South Sudan nuba and Blue Nile were separate regions and they said in these two regions they're called the two areas they will have what's called a popular consultation which was a very vague system where there' be committees set up they would go and they would talk to the people in The Villages and kind of get their opinions on things and see what they want to do if they want to separate stay it was very vague and I think it was purposely vague because the government knew it was kind of a bargaining chip for the north to to to allow ow South Sudan to have this referendum they okay and because they knew in the end they would keep them mountains because this thing was too vague you know they would be able to manipulate it enough they will keep the newba on their side so South cityan separates there were elections in nuba mountains in 2011 in May the candidate for bashir's party of course wins the governorship in the parliament just as a side note before that election the guy's name is Ahmed Ahmed Haron who was running against the guy named Abdul aiz anyway Ahmed harun was the candidate for bashir's party National Congress party and before the election Basher said

[00:20:31] Ahmed harun is our candidate and he will win this election whether by The Ballot or by the bullet so going into it it doesn't look like it's going to be a free and fair election right and Basher at this point does he already have basically a warrant out for his arrest right so he's got the warrant for his arrest that was I think 2009 I think

[00:20:49] Ahmed harun also is indicted by the ICC for war crimes he was one of the The Architects of the genocide tfor so I'm going who is our governor is under is indicted by the ICC Basher is indicted by the ICC also was a defense minister was indicted by the ICC so I'm going here wins they go and say okay now our party is there in South couran State in mountains there are still Spa soldiers like Southern soldiers living in this region the northern Army came and said you know did a force disarmament of these Spa soldiers and that's when violence broke out so June 2011 June 6 2011 Civil War breaks out in newba mountains against the government now I've heard you speak about this in the past it was overnight that most most of the staff in your hospital left so prior to that leading up to that the referendum and that the breakout of

[00:21:41] War you've got this three-year period where you're in the hospital you're working there as far as nuba can be tranquil this is the greatest Tranquility you've seen the staff is what it's you it's what else right so this time you know we started the hospital March 2008 we went there with about about eight exp Patriots including myself so I was the only doctor we had a few nurses an athetist a lab person we had those eight expatriates they were mostly from they're all from Kenya or

[00:22:09] Uganda those eight expatriates myself and we had 15 local staff nuba and the nuba I think the most educated person had finished primary school they were not nurses they were just kind of local people that could read and write a bit of English and could speak English so they had to be taught everything when we first started they couldn't weigh a patient they couldn't take a temperature let alone give an injection or start an

[00:22:31] IV anyway with time we got these guys trained up a bit so they had some pretty good skills a lot most of that was done by these expatriate nurses now we we still kept the EXP Patriots but over time we added more and more on the job trained people we kept adding more primary school graduates or eventually we got a few Secondary School people started training them on the job we didn't have any trained numer nurses

[00:22:54] Numba nurses by the time the war started 2011 so now war starts June 6 2011 by June 16th this is 10 days into the fighting things are getting pretty hairy there's a lot of fighting within nuba AA bombardments all the time and the dasis and this is all from the north the north the north right fighting within newba mountains the resistance is posed by whom is it former Southern who have not seceded or are trying to basically are are the North and the South now fighting for nuba right so what happens is the

[00:23:25] South Sudan is totally separate okay so Within NABA mountains you've got a lot of soldiers that were Southern soldiers Spa soldiers a lot of whom were nuba most of them were nuba but you also had other Southern tribes in the mountains kind of left over from the previous conflict and they were there in the barracks so that all those uh kind of

[00:23:43] Trapped Spa soldiers are fighting the Sudan Army now they call themselves instead of spa they called Spa North okay so from that point forward these guys are called SP play North they have kind of a new identity as a separate military force from the spa which is in South Sudan so fighting is going on air bombardments June 16th the dasis says look we're having we're setting a plane in and this plane is going to come in to evacuate anybody who wants to get out of there okay because and the plane was going to go to Uganda or to Sudan the plane was flying into nuba mountains okay to pick up whoever wanted to get out and they would get out and leave now this was a bit dicey because at this time there were few flights coming into new mountains mostly getting people out but they have to change the air strip there are a few air strips around but they had a they would give the location the air strip the last moment and they would have like a code name for it because if there were a lot of spies around and if the north found out they would come with their bombers and come and bomb the airst strip they would try to bomb the plane on the ground or bomb the people that were trying to get in the plane to escape so all this stuff was top secret a plane comes in and they say look we come in we get we we land we have and we're taking off in 10 minutes you better be at the air strip waiting get your get your butts on the airplane we have to be out by in 10 minutes or else these guys will come and bomb they do this at night I'm assuming no they did it early early in the morning okay because you can't you know there's no lights or anything for the planes to land so it's it's all just by by sight so they would come in the morning land and they would get out so you know all of our expats that were there with us they had all the knowledge I mean our an athetist our lab person pharmacist the the nurses that were war in charges the ones that were doing most of the work and doing the leadership they all decided to leave now did you all sit down together and have this sort of heart tohe heart which is each of you had to make a very difficult decision which is you feel committed to this work you're doing but now your life is at exponentially greater danger right so yeah we met with everybody we had a group talk and we met individually and said look this plane is coming in this is the last plane that the dasis can send in this is it you know once once this plane comes and once it leaves you might never get out of here you know because you have no idea what's going to happen the next day you don't know if the the San arm is going to overrun us and this is the last chance how did you think about about that I mean was there a moment when you thought maybe I should leave and go back to Kenya or go to

[00:26:04] Uganda or go somewhere else I mean what what was that thought process like right so you know I was encouraged to leave by some different people say look why don't you come out you stay in Kenya for a while then when things blow over then you can go back when it's safer I thought and I thought gez you know first you have no IDE this is just total chaos you have no idea what's going to happen what I did know is that we were getting people wounded or B instructions whatever coming in all the time you know so I know if I leave it's not like they can go somewhere else there were no other Hospital of surgical capability okay there wasn't a single one there was another small hospital nearby run by a

[00:26:41] German group that could do some impatient stuff and outpatient and some minor stuff but really if somebody needed a C-section or something more serious they they would just die okay and that says nothing of the casualties that are going to start coming in as a result of this attack right so all these people that came in that were wounded would just would just die a miserable death and I knew that so for me it was a very easy decision I thought you know there's no way I can in good conscience leave this place and go out it was a very very Stark reality and to be honest with it was not a difficult decision I think the sisters that were there the two camboni sisters that stayed the

[00:27:16] Priestess day we all were of the same mind we all thought the same thing let's just stick it out we're here as missionaries let's do what we're supposed to do and take care of the people the best we can and come what may we have faith in God we'll see what happens and it wasn't you know we didn't feel like it was some big thing it was just like well now we can't go you know we got we got stuff to do here and and you know the other expats said look I've got a family I've got this I've got that and we said look we are we're not going to hold anything against anybody this has to be very individual decision if you guys want to go we'll find a way to keep going don't worry about it so we want to give them full latitude to leave in peace and not feel they were abandoning people there so I think everybody's pretty much at peace with the decision the xats left and I mean sure enough they left uh June 16th the morning of

[00:28:03] June 16th they left around 6:00 in the morning they had to get out there early because they had to get the you know get this planning just get out of the place and we had to keep everything secret so all of our staff didn't know these guys were leaving we had to keep it a secret from everybody and lay up and left and then the staff came to work at 7:30 and so you you had an anesthesiologist it was one of the people that left right so talk to me about 10 o'clock on that morning the first time or whenever the first surgical case comes in who's running anesthesia that was the biggest problem so these guys leave on six 8:00 casualties start rolling in people that were there was a there's a a bombing from one of the Sudan Air Force planes called an Antonoff that has Barrel bombs they bombed in a location near us maybe an hour a couple hours away we we hear these in the film The Heart of nuba right which we'll talk about in the in a few minutes but right so like two hours later all these mangled bodies start coming in yeah describe what this I mean so I did my training at in Baltimore in many ways trauma was a feature of the training program because if you're training in surgery you know one of my mentors said you know to be able to train in a place like Hopkins is a great honor because you really get to understand surgical anatomy in trauma and its penetrating trauma in the United

[00:29:15] States is mostly gunshot wound and stab wounds MH but I have no idea what you were seeing so what explain to me what things you actually saw what types of injuries are you seeing right so this was very Stark because when an off bombs there are huge shards of of metal I mean weighing you know 10 pounds I've got a bunch of the scraps I have them as a souvenir back in nuba so imagine a scrap of metal waste 10 PBS red hot just going through your body so it it slices off legs slices off arms cuts through people with just massive tissue loss and massive trauma so I Mar one young lady she was 16 her name was shalim which means Jerusalem in in the Arabic and and her arm was just totally mangled I mean just shattered she came in her cousin came in his hand was his whole hand was blown off by the Antonov shrapnel so these guys both need amputations the the girl we did a disarticulation from the shoulders so we had a couple of our on the drog trained nurses there and they had done some they've been taught how to do spinal anesthetic by the anesthetist they they couldn't do GA for The

[00:30:23] Listener GA general anesthetic meaning they couldn't intubate and put the patient fully to sleep and I I had never intubated a patient before I remember when I was in the military we intubated had intubate goats for as part of our atls training I think if I remember but I never done it either like what the heck so I'm I was so afraid I'm like God what do I do with these people you know so I remember reading the book we have a a book there kind of basic anesthesia book so I bring through the protocols okay first give some ketamine you knock them out with that they go to sleep give it latrine you give sual Coline to paralyze them intubate then you give pancuronium you you have health anesthesia put the tube in BL blah this how intubate like okay okay let's let's do it so we took some of these guys back and you know I I would go and give the drug I had a nurse there kind on okay give the ketamine he would push it in push the Su suine I would intubate and I guess I should explain for the person listening to this because we we use these terms so commonly so intubation is a very important step where if you screw this up you're going to kill a person literally you will kill them but you have to put a breathing tube into the endot tral uh face so this is now to allow a machine to breathe for someone while they're under anesthesia and we do these things in medical school we did them in residency a lot of our critical care training required that but I have to tell you and I was not trained as an anesthesiologist I never intubated somebody without being incredibly nervous because it's so easy to put that tube accidentally into the esophagus and you think you're doing it right and all of a sudden you you know you get the tube in you hook it up to the the ventilator you think everything's going well and by the time you realize you're providing oxygen to their stomach instead of their lungs it can be too late right and then of course the Panic that ensues is often what kills the patient right because you're you're getting you're getting nervous and then you can't do it you're starting to shake you know the problem is my like I said before my training was Family Practice I did an internal medicine internship you know did Family Practice I never intimated somebody I never did anesthesia rotation in medical school that was not part of our training at all so I was very with this so anyway by the grace of God managed to get the patient inated connected the we have a really primitive structure called an omv ox for miniature ventilator it's got a set of bellows it's like turn of the century kind of stuff turn of the 20th century so you know intubating so we have to you have do manual ventilation for the patient wait wait throughout the whole surgery yeah throughout the whole surgery yeah as long as they're paralyzed you got to you got to ventilate manually usually with the hell thing after you manually ventilate for about 20 minutes they can breathe on their own and it's a bit of of an art to try to keep them under enough or they can breathe on their own but they're not in pain so it's a big art to this kind of kind of work but it's all manual I just have to go off on a tangent for a moment which perhaps only the people listening to this who have medical training will appreciate what you're saying I'm guessing you don't have blood gases no okay so you can't measure a patient's pao2 or pac2 and yet your anesthetist has to figure out how to ventilate which again means how much oxygen the person needs and how much CO2 you take off and if you screw either of those two up you will kill someone right and if you told me to walk into Mass general or NYU or pick your favorite hospital and said Peter we're going to do everything for you we're going to intubate the patient we're going to do this all you have to do is be the guy that manually ventilates them I wouldn't be able to do that like I would I would overdo it or underdo it there's no way you'd hit that sweet spot yeah you'd cause an alkalosis you would just and then to be able to not have the laboratory tools to know when you're off the rails right yeah in those days we didn't have a p socks now at least we have a pck symmet which can measure the percent oy saturation blood that time we had no pul socks some of the stuff maybe ignorance is bliss because you can't measure it so you just hope and pray that things are going okay but managed to get the guy intubated I mean you couldn't do veterinary medicine like this in the United States right yeah you know it was pretty hairy we managed to get through and this one out we we got an anestis to come this was after about a month or two well in and in that month or two what types of casualties did you see oh I mean everything abdominal trauma lots of leg traum we did a number of General anesthetics during that time we had a baby that came in with

[00:34:41] Inception this was the worst case it was a 9-month old baby who came in who had an Inception which is kind of an intestinal obstruction explain what that looks like the telescoping part right so Inception is when the intestine telescopes on itself and basically causes a blockage of the intestine and then when the longer you delay that intestine can die and the person will die the baby will die from from infection anyway made the diagnosis and I'm just like oh God you know what we supposed to do with this kid you know so anyway we we take the baby to the operate we said we got to try something so uh I mean intubating an adult is hard a baby is is really really hard and we managed to get the kid intubated so I intiated the baby started on the ventilated heane went out scrubbed for the case came back we open the baby up did a b res section put it back together close the baby up and he did great he's uh how old is the baby now he's white baby he's 8 years old now 8 n years old he's cruising but that's kind of one of the many miracles uh and when these bits of shrapnel are going through people I mean you're seeing liver lacerations you're seeing bowel injuries right hemon numores head trauma I mean give me a sense of the mortality there are some cases that obviously just can't be saved right well you I'll tell you Peter I think what happens people say why do you have so many extremity traumas because they're the ones that make it in the ones survive yeah so you know the ones that get a really terrible SHP with the chest they they bleed out in the field because we're you know we're six hours sometimes these patients come a day we've had people with penetrating abdominal trauma with multiple holes in your intestines come three four days afterwards and survive so imagine that you're leaking you're leaking feces into the abdomen for three or four days so imagine how strong these people are and they come and it's just a mess and you open them up and and some of them pull through you know anemic dehydrated they haven't eaten in several days and these guys can survive so some of is the people are just tough as nails but we get a lot of penetrating I mean kidneys get torn to shreds liver LAX massive kidney trauma liver trauma I remember one guy had we counted he had 23 holes in his intestines that we had to you know resect here resect there Stitch this one it just took forever how how did you learn surgery right so you know I trained a family practice and when I went to Kenya we're doing a lot of you know tons of tropical medicine a lot of obstetrical care did a lot of C- selections but I realized a lot of the disease burden in Africa was surgically related a lot of it I mean a lot of it course is tropical medicine that you okay do all those things and uh said well a good seem like half of what we were saying was surgically related either just wound care miscarriages laparotomies imputations the run-ofthe-mill kind of surgical stuff there's a lot of it so I thought I really need to learn how to do this stuff if I'm going to stay here long term so luckily where I've been both rural Kenya and Nairobi I met up with people that were willing to teach me things so really was like doing another residency I mean I would was naobi had a whole day in the operating room and we would do tons of cases and there was an

[00:37:46] American missionary doctor there named Mike Johnson so Mike would just sit there and teach me stuff you know I would I would do just like he did in residency I would do the case he would assist me and just kind of walk me through it there was a Kenyan surgeon there Dr ruch was a fantastic he was like a magician he was not so

[00:38:02] Hands-On but if he was always he was there in the operating room so he would say go ahead and start the case after had a little bit of experience we say start the case they have problems call me so I'd start open up look around a bit say okay I'm stuck what I do you come in look around say I do this do that I do this and that and things would go ahead before you know it you're doing thyroids and laparotomies and reecting bowel and stitching liver and taking kidneys out doing amputations and I mean you know how it is you just kind of once you learn a few you you have a few skills you can add to the next case the next one the next one and I mean it took

[00:38:32] I was there for seven and a half years in Kenya it was like doing another residency I mean at some point though you have to be making mistakes that are harming patients because even in our and I say that not being critical right but just saying like that's the nature of medicine I mean I I think of every time

[00:38:47] I hurt somebody even you know I I remember once causing a hemon numa thorax in a patient when I put a central line in them it was my 500th central line so at this point you'd think I could do it blindfolded and yet to cause that complication which in my case I'm lucky enough to have an x-ray to see that I've caused this complication you don't even I mean you're missing so many of the basic tools that could act as sort of a safety net so what was that process like I think what I wanted to make sure of when I was in Kenya I think those whole seven and a half years I was in Kenya I always had either somebody assisting me in the case or somebody in the room or in the Next Room over so I I

[00:39:26] I think I was pretty well covered during that time and by the time I was finished 7 and half years I felt pretty confident I go out on my own and do and do surgery I think it's this concept you know better than I do about 10,000 hours you know and I think in residency you have to like a thousand cases supposed like a th cases at least like that's like a minimum yeah maybe 1,200 or something yeah so I Did You Know by the time I finished my time in Kenya I done but for you it's harder because you're doing a breadth of cases that like even if you took something as broad as general surgery I mean you still doing basically orthopedic surgery as well and obstetrics right tons of obstetrics a lot of Urology there's a mix and I think maybe the trade-off is the surgery in

[00:40:07] Africa is much broader but less depth like we don't have any laparoscopic stuff of course we have any of the The Da Vinci and all that and all this high-tech stuff you trade off kind of depth of of surgery for breath I felt after doing around 2,000 C selections and over a thousand other major cases I felt okay I think I can do whatever we're doing in Nairobi I can do that I think safely in Sudan I mean obviously you know we have complications and other problems and there are a lot of limitations in terms of going into the case so you tend to do more laparotomies because you you don't have a diagnosis you don't have a CT scanner right no CT scanner you don't know exactly what's going on to get a tissue diagnosis might take you six months so you say go okay let's do laparotomy and see what that thing is that's that's your CT scan in the end but that's about the best you can do so I think what I always what I try to do when I approach a case is you know the premium know know Cherry first

[00:41:03] Do no harm so if you think you'll make the patient worse by doing this like okay I'm not an expert at doing this case um and sometimes I say I'm not going to do it you know I won't I won't do an if I think I really cannot improve this patient's health I think okay this is too much of a risk some sometimes say look I just I'm not really comfortable doing this but usually I'll feel I say okay I think it's better if we try to do this operation I think we can the patient can improve and uh we'll go ahead and it works I normally works out pretty well I was talking with my wife and my daughter a couple days ago and about how we were going to be speaking today and they had so many questions you know we all watch the heart of nuba together and um one of the questions my wife had was how do you deal with exactly that type of situation you described which is what we would consider quote unquote end of life here in the United States or paliative care what do you do in a situation where somebody comes in and your judgment says this person is not an operative candidate but also by not operating they need to be pated I mean they're not going to they're not it's not you know they're going to walk home how do you deal with that and more importantly I guess than medically how you deal with that it's emotionally and how is that communicated to the community because you're still a foreigner right right right I'm still a foreigner and and will always be one so I would say when we first started 10 years ago people did not trust us and it was incredibly nerve-wracking something we just got not here people kind of have this because they've been these people have been traumatized and oppressed for so many years they're not going to trust some

[00:42:32] Foreigner showing up saying he's there to help them so you got to prove yourself so I'm thinking well you know we got doing these operations what if we have bad outcomes you know what happens so it was really nerve-wracking for all of us and you know thank God things went pretty well we went ahead so the issue with paliative care you know we try to just talk to the family talk to the patient say look think we can't do much uh for you and as if you go home we'll take care of the pain or other the things we can do one good thing there is the people their expectations are extremely are low and

[00:43:05] I'm not saying that in negative way I'm saying in a positive way they don't expect they don't really expect miracles they want to be treated as a human they want that human touch they want they want to talk to talk to you and say okay what what can we do if you tell them look I we we can't do much they're not they're not saying they're not like demand they're not very demanding saying no you got to get it send me to Nairobi for second opinion they're very accepting I think that's just because their lives are are are very hard they're not used to good outcomes so I think first off they're they're very accepting so when you tell them look I think there's not much we can do we often will talk to the relatives culturally usually relatives will say well just you know they don't they don't like telling the patient which is very different from here in the US so we just talk with relatives and they're usually very accepting they say okay we you know we see you've done what you can we'll we'll take them home we make them comfortable there they have some of their local traditional things they might try with the person at home but they're usually very accepting of negative outcomes or bad news when you're kind of at the edge of survival all the time when you get this kind of bad news it's not so shocking to you it's like well yeah that's what happens people die you know when people have bad outcomes bad things happen to you so it's not so unusual for them you know in the US we're kind of anesthetized that everything has to be perfect and we're not supposed to die we're supposed to you know have this kind of how look on life it's it's a very different way of doing things so they're fairly easy in that respect they understand this stuff you know most people have some level of Faith whether

[00:44:31] Christian or Muslim they can accept this stuff in in a a theological sense also it's not so difficult when you showed up how primitive was the extent to which people were receiving I don't know what how to describe the type of care but there must have been local traditions and Shaman and stuff like that right right and at some point you're showing up and you're coming from a place of science as sort of simple as you describe your work in medicine it is still grounded in the fundamental principles of Western medicine you use antibiotics for example you wash your hands before you operate what was the landscape like as far as the other types of medicine being practiced and are they still being practiced now yeah they're still being practiced so their scope of medicine you have kind of the local level in the home and what they'll do is almost any febal illness so some kids got a favor someone's got a favor they burn the person so everybody there my wife included they have burn marks they look like cigarette Burns they're not cigarettes but they take a round thing it's put in the fire and they burn on the back of the wrist back of the neck on the elbows there are certain points where they burn the burn the the person to try to release the the whatever it is the spirit or evil humors that are causing the problem and when they see that kind of smoke and they see the fat

[00:45:48] Under the Skin burning they feel relieved okay you know the thing is gone now I'm better so they burn they cut a lot of people have cut marks in their arms or abdomen where they think that they think that'll also release things they cut down to have cause some blood loss that'll relieve some of the relieve some of the problem and that's usually done in the home usually by the father or the mother or the grandparents will do that kind of thing that's kind of the local treatment that is still still practiced less so than when we came I would say I mean everybody all of our staff have burn marks from when they were kids now we still see patients come with the burn mark somebody comes with a with a simple malaria they've been at home 4 days and they've been roasting the kid it's like why you know just give us a chance anyway so burning cutting that's one level they do have some herbal remedies that don't seem that prevalent they were there I think traditionally some people still use those and I don't know you know some they they still swear by it if you use the neem tree or this Kayla this plant that they use for malaria they still swear that that thing works for the for that a lot of kind of local fruits and and vegetables they use for for GI problems or other things and uh those seem to work okay and the third level is the uh what's called the kour kour is um like a kind like a shaman and the kour is like the priest for the for the village the traditional legendary is ancestor kind of ancestor worship it's it's communion with the with the ancestors so if you're sick if you have a problem whether it's physical psychological whatever you go to the kour you have a little ceremony with the family all get together kour will talk with your ancestors and then kind of give your report back saying well your kid is sick because you your goats wandered on this guy's land and ate his crops so you need to make up with this guy you need to go and give him something and then you pay the kour something and then this thing is kind of lifted child should get better those three things were kind of traditional treatment the kour is still very very prevalent in the society and they still often go to the kour and they still will often delay treatment when they go to the kour so how many people does your hospital serve katchman area is roughly a million anywhere from 750,000 to a million people is in our catchman area area and the physical region is around the size of Austria somewhere in that in that uh range the people there I for example how many of the people that you serve would understand what you meant if you were going to New

[00:48:11] York like how big is their world well it's it's interesting you asked that I mean even the ones that have finished Secondary School wouldn't have an idea like if they ended up here or I mean it' be it would blow their mind maybe I'll give an example my mother-in-law is probably in her 70s so we went to talk to my wife is talking about writing a book actually she started writing her book and we went to my mother-in-law and we said let's go and interview your mother as part of your book you know you can write on about her life my wife my wife didn't actually know a lot of facts about her mother they don't have that you know mothers and daughters there are not like buddy buddy you know the girls are you know once they once they get wean from the breast they start working carrying water and firewood and everything else and cooking for the family so we went to talk to her mom and my wife asked her mother uh her mother only speaks the tribal language she doesn't speak Arabic or English or anything else so we talk she's talking on the tribal language saying do you know where Tom is from and she said she thought for a minute she says he's from

[00:49:09] Kenya and she said that that's the furthest place she can imagine right because she's heard of Kenya so in her mind anybody who's not from newba mountains must be from Kenya doesn't matter who you are you know so that's the outside world and we said well now he's from America you ever heard of America no she never heard of it had no concept of America have you ever you know what an ocean is no concept of an ocean no concept of a lake no concept of

[00:49:34] Africa she didn't know she was in Africa so what she knew was her local area it's just a few of the villages there she been to cartoon once she's my wife's mother has leprosy we've treated her for leprosy and they amputated I think all of her fingers at one point or another she's really quite disabled she gone the cartoon some years previously to get treatment there and ended up not getting treated but besides that brief trip to cartoon she never been out of that local area a lot of my wives siblings have never been out of this 15 square mile radius you can't imagine the worldview presumably your wife also hadn't experienced things outside of that until she met you and what was the first time she left or traveled with you or the first time given especially that you don't travel much right so the first time we traveled was after we meted was just this past June we went to Armenia so that was really her first time out of rural a afca she been she went nursing school but that was in South Sudan in W which is I mean for for South Sudanese they call it a city but it's it's a village you know it's a big Village so imagine we went from we went from uh Eed refugee camp down to Juba which is the capital I mean juba's more or less a city but it's really not very nice then we fly from Juba to Dubai and we were in the Dubai airport and I mean which which

[00:50:50] I was just there a month ago even for someone who's from the United States the Dubai airport is an overwhelming ing yeah it's I mean it's it's terrifyingly huge it's a city I mean it's it's a major city so we get there and her eyes are you know the size of saucers has she seen that much electricity in one place no I mean not even close not even close has she seen fresh water to that extent

[00:51:13] I mean no I mean I'm trying to think if she'd ever seen a tap no we had TAPS in the hospital we have a pump that pumps water up we have some some uh TAPS in the hospital but you know flush toilets were she never before all this stuff elevator elevator so that was one of the things we get in there we're at the airport we get in this you know press a button this door opens we get in this thing and pressing the button then the thing goes up and we get off she's like what was that so no Concept in elevator we got in the escalator and she's like falling over the place we got to get off the escalator she's like what it how's how's this thing moving I think when she was in nursing school in a wow I think they had one set of stairs there might have been a second floor but just the concept of walking upstairs is something strange little moving staircase so all these things were very new to her now we get to Armenia and I mean just being in a city I mean the aravan is a capital Armenia not like New

[00:52:03] York but very different experience for her now she came to the US for the first time just this past October and I mean she was in Time Square I mean saw the ocean for the first time she went to my brother lives in near Boston on the North Shore of Boston so that was the first place she went so first place she went to went to

[00:52:21] Boston and our hospital was getting an award by a group called medicines for Humanity which supports us and they were given us the award for the work that our Outreach team is doing so nobody could make it you know I couldn't go my you know other staff couldn't go so my wife went uh to accept the award on behalf of the staff so she lands in Boston and the first thing she does is goes to the

[00:52:41] Harvard Club to get this Ward it's very opulent place right goes to my brother's place he's up in Rockport Massachusetts and sees the ocean for the first time sees a train for the first time goes to malls to Walmart you know she loved the dollar store and you know my family just went went crazy with her they had so much fun being with her you know seeing all these things for the first time through her eyes and uh I mean she's very has a very kind of infectious joy to her and they really kind of tapped into that and uh it was really and the flip side of that is we can sit here and have this discussion and of course most of us would be thinking how amazing at all the things that they don't have but

[00:53:20] I'll I'll share with you a story that I suspect will resonate and you will understand it this past Christmas my daughter's school each grade picks something they're going to do and that grade decided that they were going to buy Christmas presents for all of the kids at the Sudanese Community Center in

[00:53:42] San Diego and so they're basically all refugees and this was very interesting because we had already watched the heart of nubo which was her first time even she didn't know what Sudan was and she certainly didn't understand why there would be refugees leaving this place so on the day that we take all the presents there and and the kids have done an amazing job right they've bought like four or five presents for each and every kid there and we spend the whole day there so we go it's it's my whole family so it's me and my wife three kids and our youngest is like a year and a half old so there's another little kid there a sudanes girl who's also about the same age so the two of them are playing together but you know you feel like you got to sort of keep an eye on them because they can off the stairs or hurt themselves so there's a woman that's holding the sudin girl and she's sort of keeping an eye on our son as well and so that gives us time to go and do these other things and see the other kids and do all the other stuff and about four or five hours later when we're leaving my wife goes over to the woman who has been holding this little sudin girl the whole time and says um you know what's your daughter's name and she says oh I I don't know this is not my daughter I don't I don't even know who's kid this is basically and and we couldn't stop talking about that right which was talk about a different sense of community yeah right there was nothing odd to this woman who was probably 20 to just say hey there's like this little 18-month-old running around I'm going to take care of her and and by the way like she's taking care of our kid too right and and so for as many things as they lack right they have something we don't have right that that types into Peter something you always hear about the negative side of places like Sudan people think of Sudan what are the images War poverty disease starving kids the positive side is not shown and some things that always stick in my mind one is we'll have patients that come to us that it's a seven or eight day walk to reach us and on the way like they'll start their journey and start walking now nighttime comes in the society there you can stop in somebody's Hut and knock you know just kind of knock on the whatever or just show up and say look look I'm going you know I've got a long journey uh which mind if I if I kind of spend the night with you I don't know in we stay so that family would take this person in total stranger give him place to sleep give him food get some water for them to wash take care of him that night the next day he'll continue on his journey next day stop at another total stranger's place that stranger will take this person in give him some food hang out this next day same thing until they reach the hospital and this is the normal way of doing things there the concept of community and what stuff belongs to you what is a stranger totally different than our outlook here so when you're there like well gez who's really really has it all you who's doing the right thing which society is on the right track you know it's really it's really mind-blowing well especially for you because I guess it's one thing to know nothing that but but you've seen both worlds and I've read enough about you to know I've seen enough interviews to know I mean correct me if I'm wrong but you've descri Des cribed being more at home there than anywhere else right which I have to admit you know Tom when

[00:57:00] I watch the videos of that the first thought that comes to my mind is not I wish I was there I realize that probably just speaks to me being sort of a vapid shallow person but if if I'm going to be brutally honest right I don't look at that and think I want to be there right I I think I would never want to give up my family I would never want to give up my comfort my safety my whatever you couldn't fake it I mean so it's it's obviously so genuine for you and and any you know the other people like John who are serving as missionaries there I know that on some level you'll say the answer is Faith but there must be more to it than than simply your faith well you know some of it Peter I think is just I think everybody is kind of geared a bit differently so you know we grew up in a big family and you know my brothers could never could never be there but at the same time I could not do what they're doing so I think I think all of us are really were kind of wired a bit differently even people in the same family so I think I'm very comfortable there but I couldn't maybe fit working in New York you know but I think the good thing is I don't attach a value to all this stff because everybody has something to contribute I really I really believe that it's not just kind of blowing smoke my thing is is being there to the mountains you know it's a it's part of the puzzle somebody else might be in New York but you're doing a podcast you're helping us in nuba tremendously by getting help get the message out you know if you're in Sudan doing the same work I'm doing we don't have this you know so I think everybody has something to offer and if we try to get in this thinking like gosh I'm not doing what he's doing I should be doing what he's doing I think we missed the point we miss out on our shared abilities you've got unbelievable talents and a brain twice the size of mind and you're using it in an area that you are comfortable with that is probably maximizing your ability

[00:58:55] I think it's good to be aware of what's going on in the world and everybody should think about their brothers and sisters elsewhere and contribute and do something to help other people at the same time don't don't spend too much time stressing that you're not doing enough you're not doing anything do something but it shouldn't be something which is agonizingly painful you know I think just the way I'm geared that kind of life is a pretty comfortable fit for me you know so I don't see it yeah it's a sacrifice it is and uh I miss the family like crazy and I miss a lot not being with my it's been more than three years since I've come here missing my parents my nieces and nephews my brothers my sister I do I miss all that stuff but I'm pretty comfortable in that in that weird remote setting in mountains so I learned about you through my really dear friend Rick Gerson his brother Mark Gerson and ultimately met

[00:59:48] John and and and I think they learned about you through a piece that Nick Kristoff wrote In The New York Times in 2015 mhm how did Nick come to find you because that story we're going to link to that story the story is amazing right it leads off with about a 10-minute video that I watched over and over and over again and I came home and I made my family watch it and I sent it to my family back home and there's a part in it that just says everything about it I mean first of all I think Kristoff did an amazing job framing the story and he was there which is an end of itself I want to actually understand how someone actually gets there CU that's that's that strikes me as quite a challenge logistically but he he ends the article with a story of a Muslim man who proclaims that you are Jesus Christ and

[01:00:39] I always that's the title of the article if I'm not mistaken he's Jesus Christ which coming from a Muslim man also speaks to the religious Harmony that you've described right and for people like me who aren't especially religious it makes you think well I guess that's what relig religion should be about right it shouldn't be about most of what we think of religion as religion has has its tabos here but I think the point

[01:01:03] Kristoff makes and makes it beautifully is if you want to be critical of all of the religious hypocrisy by all means do so but you can't then fail to acknowledge the times when in the name of religion people are doing these incredible things in the name of all religions by the way it's not just your religion I mean as you know it's it's people of of all faith that are doing these things but in many ways I think think that story brought amazing attention to your work that it breaks my heart to think are there other Toms out there whose stories are not being told so how did Kristoff find you or how did you guys find each other he has an interest in Sudan I think he's had it for a number of years and I think for him he saw this what Bashir was doing as such an egregious affront to humanity that he felt obligated to go and see firsthand what was happening so he made a couple trips into the mountains he could fly into Juba then he got a flight up to the refugee camp in Ida and then managed to come into the mountains you know you don't come in with official permission of the Sudan government so you're sneaking into the country basically sneaking in you get a permit from the uh Rebel government and they allow you to come in and I think he just has an interest in that in that part of the world and and really wanted to do something that shed light on the situation there against Basher and he' been to nuba I think one previous time and heard about the hospital want they come and see us there and and see what kind of work we're doing to see for himself and was there for for a few days he's he's a I mean he's a really

[01:02:24] Intrepid traveler an incredible journalist I mean he's unbelievable and what I respect about him the most is he can disagree with you like you know whether whatever religiously politically not agree with your beliefs but he can realize what you're doing has benefit he can look at it objectively and say okay you know I don't believe in this religion but I I see what these guys are doing and highlight that you know not many people are willing to do that I thought it was very elegant how he framed that in in that piece in the New

[01:02:51] York Times and that video though it's only about 10 minutes that was really my first introduction to you uh oh God it's about three and a half years ago now right so the world's a better place certainly the newba mountains are a better place because of Nicholas's work right and he he tends to highlight people that are kind of not not well known and there are others that are out there that's actually part of what we're trying to do now with Aurora Aurora's focus is on is on highlighting what they say is unsung heroes but people that are kind of operating in the weeds that nobody knows about so shine a bit of

[01:03:23] Spotlight on them not so much for publicity but to help them both in their in their work and to raise by raising their profile you raise the issues that they're involved with so tell people a little bit about what the Aurora prize is and what it means for you to now be you're the 2018 recipient is that right 2017 2017 recipient so what is the

[01:03:42] Aurora prize I know it's based on I know a few things about it so I'll fill in the little bits that I know it's a prize that has a finite life correct it was began in 2015 or 16 and it will run till about 2022 23 and that duration if I recall is meant to commemorate the length of the Armenian genocide in 1911 is 1915 well it's 100 years onward the genocide went on for about eight years 1915 to 1923 so this is 100 years henceforth those eight years that's the those eight years the RO prize will be given out yes and it's a it's a substantial prize you were selected and my understanding is first of all takes an active Congress to get you out of nuba to be doing this other work but it speaks to I think your understanding of how valuable this will be to the broader mission that you're serving right what I saw was I'm I'm very comfortable being in nuba and doing the everyday medical work and I definitely want to go back to that environment longer term and get involved more with teaching the local people and when these guys once these guys come back from medical school that we have out there really working with them to get their skills up but I thought um maybe using Aura as a vehicle it was time to come out to kind of see what was out there with Aurora to try to expand the model that we have in newu mountains so find a way to bridge the gap between say big donors or people that have resources and small organizations small people on the ground that are kind of doing a lot of the

[01:05:13] Grassroots work and doing it very efficiently because I think there are a lot of other people that are doing the work nobody knows about and there should be a way to try to connect them to resources so through Aurora that's one of my main goals I wanted to come out and try to expand what we're doing I felt that was we're in newba doing our thing but maybe a little bit pigeon hold how do we expand that and get outside of Noba get into South Sudan to Central African Republic to Chad to niir other places which are really neglected parts of the world hopefully into some conflict zones that was my main thinking coming out and my time now

[01:05:47] I've got three months out of mountains I'm traveling all over the place speaking on behalf of Aurora kind of doing some basically some promotion for them but also meeting a lot of people and trying to formulate which direction we need to go in Aurora so I'll be physically out for these three months it'll be three months later in the year from September through November besides those two three Monon periods I'll be back into new mountains do my usual work at the hospital what does more money solve in this problem I remember recently Mark sent us an update about sort of where the dollars were going and it was sort of hard to believe that so much could be done with so little and I

[01:06:22] I don't think the stats are I think they're so overwhelming that it's almost hard to put it in context but it's worth trying for about a million dollars is as an annual budget what what have you been able to do in the in the past year a million dollars is is pretty generous that's probably more than we need for the basic work but let's say it it's a million dollars we can we can see about 130,000 outpatients 130,000 130,000 out patients do close to 2,000 operations see maybe 5 6,000 inpatients I mean vaccinate tens of thousands of children see I got I'm not sure what numbers of maternity antio Clinic patients but a lot several thousand maternity patients for that a lot of that million dollars I mean most of that would gosh I think it's I the number that comes that I use is about 750,000 but somewhere between 750,000 and a million if I'm be conservative if if someone gave us a million bucks we could easily run the hospital for a year and probably expand expand quite a bit what we're already doing that'd be very a very generous amount of money for us for one year which is very interesting anyone listening to this who has some understanding of the economics of the US

[01:07:33] Healthcare System would find everything you just said to be sort of comical because of just the costs here are so artificial and so inflated and so ridiculous yeah now when you think about where those dollars go I mean how do you get these supplies how I mean where do these things come from I I remember once asking I I knew somebody who was I think on the board of Doctors Without Borders and I said hey how come you guys aren't in Sudan you know cuz I remember once reading you guys couldn't even get certain vaccines and antibiotics you just physically couldn't get the supplies right so you're really doing the work that nobody else can do here yeah it's It's Tricky I mean our number one problem when people say what's your biggest problem there I always say

[01:08:17] Logistics it's the hardest thing because you don't have infrastructure infrastructure is not there and if we want anything you want chemotherapy drugs you want antibiotics you want a roll of gauze you've got to buy that in Nairobi Nairobi is two countries away it's South Sudan and Kenia so it's got to come from Nairobi like this past shipment of drugs came from Nairobi by by truck up to actually through Uganda up to the border with South Sudan where they just harassed the heck out of the out of the drivers and all kinds of you have to bribe the guards you got to bribe the guards and they give you a hard time and they won't they don't want you going through and they say no it's they're always changing the rules you know so oh no there's a duty you got to have all this paperwork I mean just reams of paperwork to get this stuff through so we've got some people that are uh in juba that don't actually work for us but work for the church that help us through all this process to get this truck through now from there there are I don't know 30 or 40 checkpoints from the border of Uganda in South Sudan up to the refugee camp in Ida and it takes a few weeks takes about 3 weeks to get up there just because of the checkpoints and the delays and everything else it can take 3 weeks to get up to this

[01:09:23] Refuge camp in Eda that from there it's offloaded we've got to go and and pick it up we got to find a way to get it from AA up to our place wait not you personally no not me personally but we've got to get some trucks or something to go down there and pick it up or find someone that can carry it up carry it for us from and that's that's about six that's about six hours it's not really a road it's a dirt track I mean there are roads there this these terrible dirt tracks you get from me up to where we are that's about 6 hours in the best day just during the dry season so rain season which runs from about

[01:09:58] June through October you can't go with the trucks you can't really even go with a um like a Land Cruiser usually we don't we don't move at all if you really had to get in or out at that time you got to go with a quad bike and that can usually get you in or out but sometimes even then if it's a flash if it's a heavy rainfall you have a flash flooding these um Dry River beds that fills up with water you got to wait maybe have to wait a day a few hours so in the hospital on on any given day how much do you have in terms of IV fluids gauze antibiotics soap right I mean things that we just we can't even imagine not taking for granted in an American

[01:10:36] Hospital right I mean if we have if this truck makes it through because we make our order and we make a fairly generous order just because we know it's so difficult to get stuff out there if that stuff makes it all through we're in pretty good shape for how long for a year so we try to make it one full year on that supply that gets sent in and the problem problem comes because sometimes you order stuff in Nairobi and it's not in stock and you know you just can't you can't order oneoff things there's no there's no system to get stuff up to us so it's really hard if you can't load everything on that truck for this one go we're a bit stuck you got to really be creative trying to get these other small things up is there like a chief

[01:11:13] Logistics officer that is in charge of the ordering and the procurement and the management of this because that sounds like a I mean that's a that's a bottleneck right yeah it's a it's a terrible job so John Fielder through F commission Healthcare has a woman who's in his he's got an office small office in naobi they got a few staff so she did all of our procurement so we sent her the list of things we needed I mean it's it's it's a lot of items um a lot so she just to go out and Source all this stuff and get it in Nairobi from a few different vendors get the trucks order all that stuff get it through uh we've got a couple people in juba that help us with Logistics that are not employees of ours they're just kind of there helping us out just kind of random people and they can help Shepherd that stuff through but it's it's it's really really difficult it's a lot of work for those people what does the pattern of mortality look like in newba my guess is infant mortality must still be quite high right how much of that is due to challenges with prenatal care versus the actual deliveries and and postnatal care

[01:12:16] I think a lot of the neonatal deaths are just from difficult deliveries you know they're baby get is fixated baby's born born and dies there is it still born or dies soon after birth and there are very few deliveries done I mean 99% of women there still deliver at home to deliver in a clinic with maybe a traditional birth attendant is rare let alone in a hospital so I think a lot of it is just due to you know most of those people probably would end up in a c with a C-section if they were at a hospital in the US or even in

[01:12:46] Kenya if they had access to care or they would have the C-section we you know we have one place doing C-sections or actually two now that do c how many babies do you deliver in a typical year I think there are May 3 or 400 in our Hospital somewhere around there I came the exact number so it's it's you know it's really it's not it's a very small number compared to the number of deliveries so Mo the vast majority of women still deliver at home and but you're doing presumably more of the high-risk ones I mean if if if a child is breached is there can you deliver a breach baby at home that's I me the risk would be enormous right make it out but a lot of those babies are going to die because they just get they get stuck they get fixated and the baby dies so I mean when we do our anti-al

[01:13:31] Clinic you know these women will come and they the Midwife there fills the card out for them so okay they've had 10 deliveries and four living children you know this one died at Birth this one died at Birth this one died from diarrhea this one died from fever you know this kind of thing so there a lot of and what about the mothers what what what is the maternal mortality like I don't know and that's something I really wish I could have a grip on because you hear occasionally you know we don't it's not it's not that often we hear about it but once I hear oh yeah this woman died from she bled a death you know after giving birth to the baby at some remote

[01:13:59] Village there's not really it's so remote and people are so spread out there's not really a system to collect that kind of information so I don't really know it's got to be it's got to happen because you know we have a lot of women that we end up doing C-sections on that would have died without that yeah you know they've you know how many times a baby is stuck the mother's already septic and you know we have to do a

[01:14:20] C-section or something and this say nothing of preac CIA and all of the other things that would just show up even under the most normal you know circumstance right and getting wom withy clamps is not uncommon so if they get clampy at home especially young you know most of them are are primips that are very young they're not going to survive when they start convulsing and to get to us is a chore it's really hard to reach us what are the patterns of diseases like there I mean when when we're watching and again I I keep mentioning this because it's just such an important film The Heart of nuba you see these things that you're doing Tom that just I mean they blow my mind and maybe because

[01:14:57] I know enough about medicine that I can watch what you're doing and appreciate you know the partial nephrectomies you're doing on kids with you know tumors in their kidneys and like how did you even learn to do that operation even within the realm of surgery that's not a trivial operation to do on a child that size yeah i' done some nephrectomies before total nephrectomies on for tumors or for trauma for whatever so meaning remove the whole kidney the whole kidney so I wasn't so worried about that but I was worried about was the other the other kidney it's harder to take part of the kidney out because you have to be able to preserve the blood flow to the part that remains right and you you know the K can bleeded that so if it if it was just say a tumor was partially involved in the kidney and say you're doing the operation and you can't stop the bleeding your backup is just to take the whole thing out but you couldn't do that in this case because this child had one kidney that had to fully come out and then there was a partial so you basically this kid would die if you couldn't save half of the remaining kidney right exactly so it was a lower the tumor was in a lower Pole the kidneys so it had take out half the half the kidney so there was a visiting actually visiting as a friend of M who was visiting he's a family practice doctor Corey Chapman was there and we're talking about this case and going back and forth and he said let's look on

[01:16:04] YouTube if there's something because I I read reading about it and everything I was reading was talking about all these fancy things you know there's some kind of a slush like an ice slush that you have to bathe the kidney in to get the Met metabolism we down so you can do the operation just different things we didn't have so we looked on YouTube and

[01:16:22] I'm just when I think about it now I wonder how we did it because normally we can't watch YouTube there because we have Internet we have a satellite dis internet but the speed is very very slow so normally we can't watch any videos because it's just too it's just too slow but for some reason you were able to see this video and it was this group of

[01:16:38] Polish surgeons that were doing the partial infomate and with a fairly low Tech approach so we watched that we said okay I think I think I can do it following with these guys are are advising we kind of followed their system managed to put these um sort of buttresses like on the on the lower pole the kidney to kind of stch the bleeding and it it worked and the child did very well that was helped by YouTube I mean I think that really helped us out in that case like the KH Academy of surgery right how long do you just spend rounding I mean how many inpatient beds do you have in this hospital it it's 435 beds and and what's your typical capacity I mean your typical utilization how many patients are in there I mean it's it's about 100% occupancy it's it's a bit less now than it was say the peak of the fighting the peak of the fighting it was crazy be five 500 people there 550 so were you know several children's

[01:17:27] War several to a bed we have wounded all over the place I mean not even in beds just wherever we could we could fit them it looks like when you see movies in war zones yeah and you see the tents that are serving as you know hospitals and you just see amputation nose completely missing you know sort of the most gruesome things that's what it looks like you're in I mean you are literally in a war zone I'm thinking back to residency if we had to round on 20 patients in the morning we were moaning and groaning like it was going to be the end of the oh my God I'm not going to have time for breakfast today before the O I'm going to round on 24 patients yeah so you're rounding on 300 patients I mean how how don't even know how you do that now probably 300 those days was more I mean

[01:18:18] I remember one time we had this measles epidemic and just on children's Ward we had 220 patients so 100 normal cases malarious B obstructions H you don't have vaccines I'm guessing is that the reason the kids all get the measles we with the first three years of the fighting we didn't have them so the usual provider stopped providing them the usual big organization that provides them stopped providing the vaccines have any just logistically couldn't get them in logistically and they we were in Rebel held territory and a lot of these people big organizations don't want to violate the sovereignity of the of the host government by providing as something as simples vaccines this is just how it is which really shocked me the sovereignty of a government that kills its own people needs to be respected it's the theater of the Absurd say it's crazy so yeah me RS were just they would take hours I me start at 7:30 in the morning and 2 o'clock I'd be finishing up and just try to get through all those people but then you're aren't you being interrupted every hour by some trauma that comes in because right there's stuff coming in there's stuff there's other emergencies I mean the other stuff was still coming I mean somebody comes in woman comes in who say a miscarriage was bleeding we have to break into do a

[01:19:25] C-section on somebody who can't deliver so all this stuff was still going on it was it was pretty crazy I mean it was you really had to just go as fast as you could it was a lot of just putting out fires and we weren't we weren't able to spend a lot of time with these patient obviously it was really had to go pretty rapid fire through all those cases it was exhausting psychologically it was it was rough one of the other questions my daughter wanted me to ask you is what's the most afraid you've ever been there you know she was sort of taken aback and we told her before the movie I I said look Olivia this is uh this isn't a

[01:19:59] Disney movie you're going to see people getting killed you're going to see bombs dropping on innocent people and it's not a movie it's real right so are there times when you are just afraid for your own safety yeah you know I think every time they bomb the hospital twice and they bombed our our local region kind of within a half kilometer several times so the first time the area was bombed we were at church and the church was just Outdoors it's not really a church it's kind of an outdoors thing and we were finishing up and the the catechist was up there talking to people and we heard the airplane overhead we were used to it because every day the airplane came overhead but we' never been our immediate vicinity had never had never been bombed so we just got all the airplanes over head it's going to bomb somewhere and and is that because you had this belief that said even these people as wicked as they are wouldn't actually bomb a hospital is there some sort of view of we'll respect at least one sanctity of Life yeah so that was that was bit in the back of our minds and we hadn't been bombed yet this was this was a couple years into it or we hadn't been bombed directly there weren't commercial flights so anytime you heard an airplane it was going to bomb somewhere and then we hear the we hear the airplane then invariably a few hours later wounded would show up they bomb somewhere and people were wounded and wound did show up this day it was a bit different we he the airplane overhead and the mass was over kind of we standing there also somebody says everybody get down so we we just dive on the ground they was lying flat and I heard airplane drone over had you this anten off sound then I heard the the pitch changed was high pitched like a

[01:21:27] Waring sound almost like a jet engine noise and then boom this incredibly loud explosion it felt like it was 2 feet away I mean it was like half a kilometer away it wasn't right but it was so loud and it circled again then then I realized that what that Waring sound was was the sound of the bomb falling through the air so then I now so now I know what that sounds like then this happened six they bombed six times you kept hearing thing comes around again bombs and you're lying there terrified thinking you just you feel like you want to burrow yourself into the ground and disappear you know you're just lying flat exposed thinking what you know what happens and the thinking is not even so much being killed but what if what if my you know what if my leg is blown off or my arm gets blown off you have no control over this you're totally at the at the mercy of these people and you feel like you're you feel like you're just an like a hunted animal that's the that's what I felt like I feel like I'm

[01:22:24] I'm a hunted animal and at that time since we hadn't been bombed we didn't have the the fox holes dug around so immediately after that we went and we dug fox holes all over the hospital grounds and that's what you see in the film there actually one point when you're being interviewed and the bombs start coming and you guys have to jump into these foxholes right right then another time we were bombed I was in the hospital and just down on the on the floor of the hospital you know and you're thinking well you know we just you're just thinking this this might be it this thing might you can't tell where it's going to fall you hear that Waring sound and when you hear that woring sound you don't know if that's going to fall on top of you if it's going to fall right next to you and and and just then shatter your body you have no idea so it's really it's it's really terrifying

[01:23:09] I mean there's no other way to describe it and I mean you know when you see this stuff that's that happened in Syria people living in these cities I mean you you can imagine what that is like and the kids that were in that situation that's something never they'll never outgrow that fear and that feeling of of being bombed you really you feel like you're a hunted animal I think it's the closest thing I can not that I've ever been hunted I'm an animal but you just feel like I remember thinking to myself we were down this is after this is a few bombings later down in the

[01:23:41] Foxhole and there was a a suco 24 jet going overhead suco 24 is a supersonic jet bomber you know bombing Villages you know Huts thinking what of these people doing and we're thinking to these guys say how can they bomb us don't they know there are people down here that's what I felt you know like go some exercise where they made a mistake and of course they knew exactly there are people down there that's why they're bombing you know but I I really hope someday I will meet these Pilots not that I don't even feel any animosity towards them the feeling is never as strange you don't feel anger you don't feel animosity towards these people just kind of wondering like what are they doing like why are they doing this so I would love to meet these guys someday and say what what were you thinking you know what what did they tell you before you did your mission you know I was a flight surgeon in in the Navy so I know you have a briefing before the pilots fly out they discussed the mission today we're going to fly here we're going to bomb this target this is our objective what were you told in the briefing room they say okay today guys are going to the Bama Hospital there a bunch of civilians there I mean presumably if you're if you're trying to put your psychology hat on you have to believe that they are being told that the people that they are bombing are somehow a threat to them or their sovereignty and supporting rebel I mean you you'd have to concoct a story that's so orthogonal to the truth right maybe that might be it because I mean after one of the times the H was bombed one of our staff heard a a radio broadcast from elade which is a city in the north and um the way they portrayed it on this radio was they admitted they bombed hospital they said we bombed an American Church hospital in CA which is the kind of capital of the Rebel held territory Hospital taking care of the Rebel soldiers that's how it's portrayed so you're an American

[01:25:33] Hospital in America of course is a great enemy is a Christian Hospital therefore they're no good and it's taking care of rebels taking care of rebels so you're you're justified in this in this act and my guess would be that's what these guys were fed who knows that the pilots were True Believers I know worked with a lot of pilots in the US mil military and they would they would not go along with the mission if they said you're going to the Bama hospital with civilians they wouldn't do it would say look man we're not doing this I know these guys they were not uh these guys they love the fly and they loved the country but they were not interested in killing civilians and uh I still hope someday I can meet these guys and just have a talk with them and uh just to know what they were thinking and what what went on in their brains like what did they know this how' they feel about it I'm just interested what they would what they would say how did you cope with what I could only imagine is Stress and Anxiety aren't the right words but just sort of the gravity of it like you know when you describe a day in your life you know getting up at 5:30 in the morning making rounds at 7

[01:26:37] Operating if you said Peter you got to go do this for a month I mean first of all I could provide no assistance to you that's the unfortunate reality of it right despite my medical training I I would I mean I could you know put IVs in patients and that's about I mean I I don't think I could provide any benefit but let's assume I could even magically provide benefit I can't imagine how physically but more so emotionally exhausted I would be at the end of 30 days right even thinking back to my training where you know you'd have every other night call but on one of the nights in between you didn't get to go home and so you've been in the hospital for three and a half days and it's been one trauma after another like even that feel is just as physically tired as you are there's something different going on which is just an emotional depletion right so to imagine that you're now eight no more you're coming up to 11 years into this and this is just in Sudan right I don't understand how you can do that I think you hit hit the nail in the head I think probably the emotional trauma and upset is probably worse than the physical degradation your body takes by just always being on call and just even when you're not cold at night it's hard to sleep you know always there's a lot of kind of fear and worry about things but there's always that less so now because they not bombing but there's always that sense of worry about being physical danger but even when you're out of that when the physical the risk of physical danger is not there it's just the the psychological thought of always been responsible for the for the patients and not having a psychological rest like I can't refer these people somewhere there are other colleagues we can talk to or get an advice on or have somebody else see the patients it is very draining and um I don't know I just you know a couple things is one of course is I do draw on my faith all the time and I think that does help me keep centered a lot you know I go to church every day and and that's I think helps put things in a bit of perspective that's just how it is and besides that I think you see the people there they see the strength and resilience of the uba people you say well okay if they can put up in this environment and and keep functioning keep going ahead let me just try to keep taking care of them as best I can so I definitely get a lot of strength from the people there and their attitudes they've been in this for their whole lives and they're they're not giving up they're pushing ahead with things so let me see if I can also just keep going it's not easy by any stretch both physically and mentally and emotionally it's it's it's very very draining but I don't know it's weird I mean you get up in the morning and you you know have this huge number of patients to get through and you kind of say man not sure if I can so I'm tired already the you kind of see the first

[01:29:26] View and then you before you know it you're finished with the children's Ward take a deep breath okay I got through all the children now we go to the female Ward you get through there you pick up pace a bit you get to the male Ward you go through them see the maternity patients now it's 1:00 you're okay I finished the rounds we go to clinic you go to clinic and there's a big line of people how many patients would you see in clinic typically uh maybe 4050 again I don't even know know what that means I mean I think most us

[01:29:54] Physicians would have a hard time seeing that many patients in a week in clinic do you have any blood tests you can do can you do cbc's or uas even I mean what what's the extent to your diagnostic toolkit so until recently you had nothing I mean now you have an ultrasound right we've had the ultrasound from the from the beginning

[01:30:11] Okay so we've had it the whole time that's been hugely helpful you don't have an x-ray machine x-ray we do now okay so we just got that about a year ago so you can do a chest x-ray at least if you want some assistance with does this person have pneumonia or Puma thorax or something like that right so prior to a year ago we we didn't have the X-ray now we do and it's it's been a help lab has been difficult we can do a urine you can check a stool we can do a hemoglobin sometimes we can do a CBC but the the machine always seems to be broken you know get a new machine work it for a while then it just stops working can't do a

[01:30:42] CBC chemistry tests we can sometimes do a cening but then that machine breaks and you know you can't do a cening sometimes you can do alt St Machine brakes can't do anything but would those things matter in other words if if if if someone's listening to this and says well gosh if it's $50,000 to buy a new lab piece of laboratory equipment can we have one of those you know brought in with next year's supplies would that change would that make life easier for the care you guys provide it would help and you know like there's a just saw this chemistry analyzer is called a piccolo which is supposed to be kind of built for these remote locations it's pretty doctor proof I mean you kind of have this thing that's pretty Hardy you slip in a disc you put a drop of blood on it and it gives you result so our guys in the lab could do that not our our guys in lab can do the test but the machines are just very it's less about the human it's more about the you need a robust machine you need very robust machine so this is kind of a a thing and that's about 14 Grand if we had one of those in some of the the discs which have the reagents kind of embedded in them so if you had a year supply of of test strips or reagent discs and then the machine right you could do a CBC in a chem7 or a metabolic panel of some sort right that would yeah that would definitely help we're pretty limited we can do a periperal blood film so Tak a blood you know guys can do the film we can look at that so you're a pathologist now too yeah and a very you're a hematologist I'm terrible at it but I I can pick up like a chronic leukemia chronic myologist chronic ltic or an acute leukemia those are if it's pretty obvious we can pick those up but a lot of blood films I'm baffled and when you have a child that has leukemia I assume you send them to Kenya it's impossible why it's too far it's too expensive it's too difficult like just the administrative stuff to get them there and the Chance in Kenya of them being I mean maybe at a higher end hospital they could get decent care but they just we just can't do it so what do you can you treat with chemotherapy at child not with leukemia if a child is Leukemia we often will give steroids to try to you know a bit paliative care yeah for leukemias for chronic leukemias these are again are usually adults if it's a chronic lioc leukemia we'll treat them with cyos we don't have tablets we'll give periodic injections and that can kind of whight them a bit CML chronic myo leukemia we don't have treatment for

[01:33:00] I would like to have at least at least some hydroxyurea which is kind of an older drug for it you know this drug gleevac yeah I just about to say gleevac would cure most cases of CML right I mean it's a very expensive drug in the United States of course that's the problem so with gleevac I was so excited like a month or two ago I'm reading that

[01:33:16] GAC is now in generic like oh my God maybe we can buy GAC because we get a few a year we don't get a huge number of C patient we need a few think man we wouldn't need a huge amount you know so so I look it up and it's okay gle's G on generic so the price went from 8,000 a month to 7,000 a month yeah this this is another one of these ridiculous systems you know problems which is a lot of times when drugs go from being branded to generic there's virtually no change in price right we just can't do that you know there a lot of things that are just beyond our scope of being able to pay for it that's something that to me is it's really difficult to consider I mean if there you know we can be as critical as we want of the US healthc care system for all of its buffoonery but in large part it's because we can be buffoons right right it's because we have infinite resources though we don't right but right in the short term we have infinite resources and so we never have to ask the question of what are we optimizing for and how do we triage expenses on the other hand you're faced with that decision every single day right so you would look at a patient with CML and say we're not going to spend $80,000 a year to save this person's life because as much as we believe every life is equal we sort of know that $80,000 can save a hundred lives in another way and are you the one that has to make that decision by yourself yeah it's agonizing it's absolutely agonizing that's that's that's just one example of many I've got a woman that comes all the time with CML and she's got a huge spleen that hurts she's anemic and uh she got a bunch of kids I got to talk to her in clinic and and try to figure something out with her she walks I don't know how long how far she walks to reach us I mean it's absolutely agonizing I cannot send her anywhere this just it's totally impossible just can't do it so if we had we wouldn't need mountains of

[01:35:12] GAC I mean a small amount would be enough to at least get her through a year there are few people that have CML it's a few it's not a huge number if someone's listening to this and they say I'm going to tell you a story in a moment called the starfish story but I want to save one starfish that's that's

[01:35:26] I'll tell you the story logistically would it even be possible for someone to provide one year's worth of gleevac to a patient in your hospital is that something that they could do through the American uh the African Mission how would someone even logistically go about providing specific or project-based funding to your mission if they can get the drug say they had access to the physical drug here in the US maybe if they sent it to say Catholic medical mission board which is my sponsoring lay sending agency and they also help us a lot with Logistics and with they're the overall managing the hospital they might be able to find a way to get it down to us at least get it to Juba and then we could figure out a way to get it up to us if they can get the physical drug there was a program when I was in

[01:36:08] Armenia the time before last we met some guys and there's there supposedly some leack program that you can register like the patient can register and they can get drugs at either low cost or no cost so went through all thing contact the person she said okay all you have to do is take have fill out these forms have the patient go to Cartoon get the drugs that's absolutely impossible we can't get to cartoom that's in the other side of the Enemy Lines and uh you just can't reach there so which gets back to your point of providing the money is half the battle but the logistics of actually getting it in there and I mean just spitballing you can't have these things air dropped or air lifted in because the enemy Fighters will obliterate anything that's trying to it's not like you can fly the Cessna in there to stuff in there there's been no non- bombing aircraft in our airspace for it's been since November 2011 so so even foundations like the gates foundations which do a ton of great stuff in Africa I mean Sudan's basically off limits you know say they were able to provide money for a bunch of gleevac one of the problems and one of the problems I've I've decided to go with aora is a lot of these funds are are kind of unsalable if you're like I'm an individual or even a small organization that's trying to apply to one of these big organizations they just get through that application process to get funds and then to account for it and do monitoring evaluation and followup it's a very daunting task you need you need people who are training this area of writing proposals and moning evaluation all that sort of stuff to really follow through with all this it's very difficult to access some of these big funds and big organizations you know a lot of these bigger groups are set up to do that kind of work and their administrative size has grown exponentially because in order to get these this funding you need a big administrative staff to apply for the funds and followup and accountability and accounting and all that kind of stuff right and you I mean you've got tons of extra time I'm sure to do that right I just can't I just can't do it I just can't do it unless it can be made fairly simple where someone's okay if I got the drug I'll send it to Catholic medical Mission board and then Catholic medic Mission board will send it down and we get the drug you know at least as far as Juba then we can try to figure out a way to get it up but it's just it's really there's a problem with access and just getting through the administrative things you have to do to get some of this stuff there's um so there there are several kind of different levels of of difficulty so going back to the sort of state of diseases you see if a person makes it out of their sort of the young life right if a person's sort of your age or my age what are they going to die from middle-aged people we have a lot of therosis liver Cancers and that's there's a huge Hepatitis bastis B yeah huge like we do we screen all of our pregnant women for hepb do you guys have a hepb vaccination program we do we do um the reason we started screening the the pregnant women is just to get an idea about the basic rate and it's about close to 20% Hepatitis B positive just in general population is are people who are not sick they're pregnant with children so what we're doing is we encourage a mother when the baby's born we give the baby hepatitis B vaccine immediately after birth and we hope with that that will stop prevent this baby from get hepatit b as it get older and prevent all the complications from that we haven't really scaled up to the point where we have so many heavy positive people and can you only vaccinate the women who are coming in for deliveries or are you able to get the vaccine into the community for the women who are still delivering at home no we haven't we haven't reached that point yet so you're only scratching the surface then because the majority of these birds are outside of your hospital right exactly I mean eventually we' like to have kind of midwives these places and have the testing capability to test all these people for Hepatitis B or if people delivered in these clinics you look we can't do the testing but we just give the vaccine we'll assume the kid has

[01:40:01] Hepatitis B give the vaccine because they get he b anyway as part of the pentavalent series so after that first shot we continue with pentalon which is DPT theosis tetanus Hepatitis B and um mous influenza B I've heard that kids actually can get dip theia in in Africa yeah has there been a case of dip theia in the United States since the 40s no I think that I think I don't even know what defuria is I mean like I it sounds stupid to say that but I remember learning about it in medical school and

[01:40:27] I know we all get the vaccine for it what what is the disease what does how does it manifest we've only had from what I remember one case and I think she had theor it was in an adult but it's a gry bacterium thei and it's a bacterial infection it affects the throat and they get like a it looks almost like a a thick scab that forms in the throat they kind of die from Airway problems you know just thing is thick and they can't really swallow they can't really breathe well and they can die from Airway problems it's a horrible really a terrible disease and you mentioned your mother-in-law has leprosy right again

[01:41:01] I've never seen that in my life it's a bacteria as well it's is it in the tuberculosis family or something exactly it's microbacterium lepry it's a microbacterium and it's transmitted by respiratory droplets oh it's not by touch I thought leprosy was sort of contagious through touch yeah that's that's is that a wife's tail yeah it's really transmitted by respiratory droplets and it should be prolonged close contact so somewhat similar to TB it's not a real it's a very slow growing organism but prolonged close contact respiratory droplets you can affect it affects the nerves in the skin and but that nerve U infection people lose sensation they they get Cuts or wounds they don't take care of things they burn themselves they don't pay attention to it gets infected bone gets infected you have to amputate the digit are these people prior to your arrival that were kind of outcast and they would be not touched or anything like that yeah there was definitely discrimination against them they didn't have like separate places where they would make them outcasts but people would kind of avoid them like my mother-in-law still I think a lot of it was the people themselves would kind of withdraw due to shame and due to the fear of of giving it to somebody else like my mother-in-law kind of withdrew she stays by herself she doesn't eat with the other family they keep telling her look come and eat with us is okay but she will not come and eat with other people she always insists to kind of eat on by herself she does it herself she's kind of a self-isolation from society she's pulled herself out so she'll talk to you in chat interact with you but then with eating and with more social interactions she'll kind of pull back and eat by herself and how prevalent is tuberculosis very very prevalent and for our place our HIV rate is quite low which is what it's less than much less than 1% maybe point something maybe 0.1% and is that an artifact of where you are geographically or is that as part of the benefit of some of the aid relief that made its way in the early part of 2000s yeah I I I think the main reason is our isolation is there drug use there prostitution I mean which I assume would be the two most dominant modes of transmission now prostitution is not really part of that

[01:43:08] Society drug IV drug use is is unheard of it's all through like with most of Africa is through heterosexual transmission and I think just the it's starting to get a little bit of a tow hold in nuba but still a rate is very low I'm worried that if if peace comes and the place opens up and you got more movement of people in and out the rat's going to Skyrocket that's what happened in South Sudan the nidus is there because we have a lot of STDs gar is very common syphilis I me we do you see tertiary syphilis and really advanced cases or I don't think so but maybe some of the stuff we're saying is just undiagnosed tertiary syis I don't know I

[01:43:45] I don't think we see it what I see is cus is we have we do vdrl test and we have a lot of vdrl positives which are not you know it's not a very accurate test have a lot of false positives we have a lot of vdrl or rpr positive people we do that um screening we're screening now with the pregnant mothers for vdrl and we have a lot of positivity we don't see the

[01:44:19] shankersinh 60s 70s that's in heart failure and it's like bacterial or I remember there was some bacteria like shagas something or rather that would weaken the heart muscle is it that type of a heart failure yeah no we don't have shagas disease in our area it's just old age but do you think it's atherosclerotic in origin I don't think so I've never seen anybody that could say I think this person had an MI just not a single one in 10 and a half years some is hypertension just kind of untreated hypertension and we let people come in with blood pressure of 250 over 180 really yeah how prevalent is obesity overweight type 2 diabetes obesity about 0.00001% almost almost non-existent an occasional person is a bit overweight but really really rare and how often do you see type two diabetes we'll see it not so prevalent but it's it's definitely there some see older you know older people come in and just new diagnos of diabetes maybe somebody his 40s or 50s do you ever see fatty liver like when you're operating on a p do you ever see that the liver is fatty and no no I think no never I can't remember a single case when I've I've seen fatty liver what kind of cancers I mean you do so much cancer surgery especially in children but they cancers we don't see that much here right what types of cancers do the people in nuba get versus basically not get I mean in the United

[01:45:43] States of course you'd have lung breast colon prostate are the Lion Share of cancers followed by pancreas so those are the big five how prevalent are those cancers in nuba not so I mean like in if we go to kids first our burkus lymphoma is fairly common that's an EBV related if I recall right epin bar virus is epin bar virus and you only you really just see that in malaria holoendemic regions so we're in that it's called a burket

[01:46:11] Zone and that's a great cancer because it's curable with with just cyop fosmid six course is cycop fosmid and you cure a cancer it's great forus satisfying but it's rare to have a cancer you can cure obviously for adults liver cancer is probably probably most common and that's all I think all hepatocellular carcinoma cellular carcinoma and probably all related to Hepatitis B positivity they drink a fair bit this local local beer they make from sorghum but the alcohol content is not very very high it's fa weak so hey related cancer with liver we have a fair bit of cancer of the cervix so for females probably cancer of the cervix is the most common and can you screen for HPV you're the local gynecologist as well right can you do a papsmear no papsmear would be a little bit impractical we have to do the swab and get that sent off and do it high level you know get it off to a pathologist or is there any way I mean again if someone were listening to this and said oh my God like if I could have an impact on eradicating cervical cancer for these women right is that even feasible to have the equipment there to after you do the swab assess for HPV no for cancer makes two approaches one would be this gardisil the HPV vaccine were made available either at very low cost or just giving us part of I think it's I actually just heard today as part of the who package so they can be integrated into the system where HPV is given to young girls even young boys but then we're back to the logistics problem right is how do how even if the who or any of the foundations came along and said we want to provide HPV vaccination on mass to Africa you're still somewhat excluded right we give other vaccines if they can be lumped into your annual supplies right and just do it to get stuff out there but if you do it in one big push yeah get it out there it's got to be all cold chain it's really it's really hard but it's doable get the stuff out there one big push that would make a huge difference so start with that to treat cancer the surfice treat earlier versions they call it a see and treat technique I've not done it but it's notef there's probably a YouTube video on it there probably is I think I think there is actually you paint the cervix with with something I can't remember if it's iodine or some substance and you look for irregularities in the cervix and then you freeze it you have the little Nic nitrogen cylinder with some probes put that in the cervix and you freeze it make a nice ball out of the cervix that you you you kill those pre-cancerous cells and hopefully those people will not go on to develop invasive cancer the cervix you would need some Personnel for that because that would be pretty labor intensive that's more of a preventive medicine thing would come in examine them because you're not you're not treating people with the cancers you want to get the precancerous lesions so you have to screen them do a lot of these screening things we paint the cervix with some substance look and see you don't even appar you don't even need a culos scope it's something even more simple than that and I know they're doing it in

[01:49:05] Uganda and they have this equipment so that might be kind of an in between thing before gardisil becomes available at least we do a screening of young women check the cervix see what what it looks like when you paint the stuff and then treat with liquid nitrogen we don't have the equipment like none that stff is there nor the knowledge to to do it what about breast cancer how prevalent is that it's definitely there the problem with breast cancer is by the time we we diagnose it they only we only diagnose it when you can feel a lump no one's getting a mamogram right no mammograms or we don't you know do other stuff the the diagnosis of Miz may we have women present with a palpable mass that they're feeling and they show up right so usually they come with a palpable mess and they already have nose and exilla so so you in that situation you still do modified radical mastectomies we do we used do a modified radical mastectomy and then follow with adriam pyos myo and do that sort of every month for about six cycles and I mean it's still the results are are pretty dismal I mean usually they they get a couple years but two years on two and a half years on they come back and they've got another lump they got lump in the axilla there's another tumor in the in the chest so it's the chemotherapy almost assuredly isn't helping is it no I I really don't think it's doing much so it's it's really frustrating would getting a mamogram machine add value I mean of course there's all the futility and the controversy around mamography per se but

[01:50:28] I'm just sort of thinking of like what are some finite resources that could be added to I mean you're serving a million people basically that live in a world we can't even imagine as far as even the simplest acts of prevention right the problem with that to to do the screening to scale up to that level yeah you need a whole new staff to get people through through right and the same thing with with cancer Sur screening it's may be possible so it's not just a matter of supplying the machine you need the radio you need someone who's dedicated to reading mammograms all day long or I mean I guess the other option is I mean

[01:51:03] AI should actually make mamography this is probably one of the most important applications of machine learning is actually reading X-rays and you don't you wouldn't even need a radiologist at some point you know there will be a day when you could run a million women through a mammogram in a year and there's a machine that's reading it and basically giving you the answer and then now you still need the logistics of a person taking the patients through the machine and operating the machine but anyway we got to think big Tom we got to we got to think of these other ideas I think these are areas where technology and medicine and developing were there's not always a good marriage but there are some areas where you have technological leaps like for instance our x-ray machine part of it the reason we waited eight years to get one first of all they were expensive as heck how much did it does it I I don't even know how much how much an xra machine would cost this one cost 33,000 which of course in the

[01:51:53] United States that's the cost of like getting your gallbladder removed right I mean literally that's about the cost of a colos cystectomy yeah so it was I mean for us was a big expense but we do a lot quite a few x-rays now our operating the guys actually taken or X-ray techs are the operating room guys like the guys in the operating room that my lab my assistant in the operating room are the ones we taught how to take X-rays and they do a pretty good job we waited that long because we wanted a model that we could use was very small lightweight simple where we didn't have to use the chemicals and developers and all that sort of stuff and we just waited and now we have a model where is it digital it's digital so it's a tiny little device mounted on this little thing and gosh it's like the size of a small like a tiny box that has the X-ray tube in it and it's a laptop and the screen is a operates by bluetooth between x-ray machine and the computer take the X-ray that shows up on the computer screen and it's all there and you can take that

[01:52:52] X-ray and adjust you can darken it lighten it you can focus in on certain areas I mean it's it takes a beautiful X-ray and you can just play around with it so you really get a nice picture and there's very little variable cost at this point it's it's it's all a fixed cost that you've covered and now it you can the more you use it the better you're getting more absolutely and it's you know the the power is also the other thing was the power needed because we're on 100% on solar we've got a backup generator it's 12 half kilow how long does 12 and half kilowatts last the hospital if the panels were to go out we could run things on it the problem with the rate limiting factor there is the fuel like right now I think we I think we're left with maybe oh so you if you have enough fuel for the generator you could run indefinitely off it if you needed to yeah but I mean we have to give probably big breaks of time you know it's it's a pretty it's a fairly good size thing and the hospital is the only thing that has electricity like you don't have electricity in your home no there's no grid so it's just just the hospital has power that's you know we we run on on the solar I mean pretty much 24/7 we really don't need the as long as the batteries are there and everything's functioning we don't need the generator at all and uh we try to we try to find the time when it's these batteries are going to order a new set and new panels whever we need to reup that so we're I think three years into this set of batteries what about colon cancer do you see that pretty rare we've had what maybe two or three cases in 10 years I mean it's really really rare the folks who are the the most elderly within the community live to what age I mean what is considered old there you know nobody there knows their age you know they don't have any birth records even my wife doesn't know her age she's somewhere in her 30s probably so they don't really know their exact age but I would guess they're probably in other person there are probably be in the 70s and his or her 70s I don't think they they live much beyond that and do you see cognitive impairment in that population really rare you rarely get somebody who say I think this person has

[01:54:46] Alzheimer's really really rare to see that I mean I think they should die of something else before they reach that stage you just don't see it the point you just made that reminds me there's a m movie which you may have seen it's I think it's called a good lie yes it stars Reese Witherspoon it's a beautiful story yes after we saw the heart of nubo we watched that because I wanted my daughter to sort of understand the history of the Sudanese refugees and that that's one of the points from the movie that I remember being very sort of moved by they were all assigned the same birth because nobody knew their birthday like even something like that that we would take for granted do they celebrate birthdays no nobody does I mean you know my wife we kind of invented a birthday or she invented one on November 21st so when that day comes around we'll usually do something and she's always surprised she like what what's what are you doing oh so she doesn't give me a hard time for not buying flowers if we could buy flowers so it's pretty it's it's pretty easy to be married to a new lady it's you know she doesn't expectations are very low how has your life changed since you've been married I mean do you have a greater sense of obligation to not die to put it bluntly yeah I would yeah definitely so I'm like you know you can't be so cavier with things because now I've got a wife and I wanted to kind of look after her and make sure she's okay there's been a little bit of a change in perspective with that and I think if and when we get children I think that'll change another degree up for sure do you think you could do what you do if you had children I think we could stay there and if things got really hairy we'd have to see how to proceed but just in terms of I mean your wife is a nurse so you have the luxury of working together so as focused as you are on your work she is there with you right when you have children they will not work with you for for quite some time I just wonder would it be challenging to sort of now be torn between two obligations that for many years will not overlap at all it'll be difficult you know I think one thing and one thing I I I remind my wife of is that you know I I finish work late and

[01:56:56] I'm always you know often preoccupied with things and things with the hospital and all that sort of stuff but at least I'm there every evening the weekends we have a little bit of time on a Sunday to be together and even though the work is is is very much all-encompassing there's no commute and then no distractions you know we don't have there's no TV there's no radio we don't have other things that kind of occupy our minds so when we when we're together at home we really can be present to each other and I would hope that if we have children I'll be able to use that to really spend time with the kids and not be always you work you know if life continues like that in newba there's not any travel involved I'm I'm just there you know I'm a stone it's funny when you say it that way it's actually you may actually spend more time with your kids than many of us do right here because of our distractions and our travel and our this and our that yeah life here is is much more hectic I mean it's it seems almost ironic to say do you feel out of place here even though you grew up here

[01:57:54] I mean when you walk down Park Avenue or Madison Avenue are you sort of like what in the hell is this place yeah I do I do feel a bit out of place in a sense I do enjoy it like I I've never even when I was I grew up in Upstate New York I never spent time in New York City so this is really kind of it's it's exciting I like it but I don't think I could I could stay longterm I mean a lot of people I'm sure say they about New

[01:58:16] York but I do feel much more at home in the m where it's it's very quiet and kind of sedate and your time is your own when you're off what possessions do you value I mean I I I know you have some textbooks and things but I mean your home is very modest obviously by the standards of someone living in the

[01:58:34] United States it would not really you wouldn't even really call it a home in the same way right but you don't give the impression that you're wanting no I really don't I think that was been my character since I was a kid I'm very much I think I'm very much a minimalist since I was born all these clothes you see me wearing the from the well the socks the trousers both these shirts I bought when

[01:58:57] I came out of nuba last month so I have scrubs I had scrubs I had one pair of trousers I had a suit a few t-shirts and that was it and they're like hey look you got to go and meet people you can't be wearing your scrubs around so I had a b this scrab when I came out it was painful for me to buy clothes like I don't I just don't like it when I go back I said look when I go back to mountains all this these winter coats and this stuff I'm not taking this stuff back with me I'll keep it in Armenia let someone there use it I don't I don't want it my suit I do have one suit that

[01:59:28] I wore to the ceremony in Armenia the world prize ceremony but I bought that suit in 1985 so I haven't bought one since then probably when you were interviewing for medical school or something well I was interviewing for jobs like for engineering jobs that's the reason I bought it so it was the one I same one I used for interviewing for for medical school and then uh I've used it when I come out for the Sor price ceremony I'll take it out and or do with a blue shirt and a tie thought a ball of crap in 1985 and I know that you it's absolutely against your nature to sort of be critical of anyone but do you spend any time thinking about the way the world works here and how most of us are somewhat attached to our possessions yeah and the more possessions we have the more complicated Our Lives get I mean you certainly hear people talk about minimalism few people can apply it to the extent that you can of course but I mean what have you learned about this and how how could you speak to somebody like me who you know loves his possessions as much as the next person and can't imagine giving up these

[02:00:35] Comforts I mean help me understand because you don't look like you're miserable no and you look even happier in these videos in nuba I'm sure that this is about the hardest thing you've had to do all year yeah slep around New York and talk to idiots like me no you know I'll tell you Peter I really do believe that the more detached you become not like in this Buddhist kind of

[02:00:58] Nirvana sense but the more detached you are from from things the easier life is it just simplifies your life I mean for me I look at at all a lot of possessions and things and attachments as just adding more complications you know life becomes so complicated it's much harder here in the US I see my sister and how she's interacting with the kids you know there's a reason why advertisers are good at what they do you know what they want to do is convince you to buy something you really don't need and they're very good at it why does

[02:01:26] Medicine Avenue exist why is there huge bildings in Madison Avenue these guys are very good with what they what they do they're convincing they've managed to convince all of us to get things we really don't need and convince us that we'll be only happy and fulfilled and satisfied if we have those things so you got all this tsunami pushing against you for me I think just because I'm in in a place where you can't have anything that kind of realize well geez I don't have any of this stuff and I I kind of like it it's it just makes things much easier for me I've always been a bit of a minimalist even when I was when I was younger but I've come to kind of feel that that's really I do feel better with less and I think everybody is looking for some kind of meaning in life you know uh this book this man search for meeting this uh Victor Frankle Victor

[02:02:11] Frank that was some that was one of my is one of my favorite books and this idea of logo therapy but we all really do need a sense of meaning in our lives that's extremely important for our psychiatric makeup whatever that is it's different for every age person whether it's kids whether it's your pets whether it's your job but to try to get something in your life that's meaningful and if you're looking for it this will be philosophizing it certainly I think if you're looking for in material possessions I don't think you'll find it there so if I can make a bit of an aside something I talked about earlier with a talk with the Catholic medical

[02:02:45] Mission board volunteers my favorite Bible passage I can't remember the the book and the verses but the basic story is there's a guy the guy's a very wealthy young man and he goes to Jesus they says they try to justify himself and says look what do I have to do to get eternal life and Jesus says well follow the prophets you've got all the stuff there follow the ten commandments follow the laws of the prophets and you'll you'll be okay and the guy says well I do all those things what do I need to do to really become perfect and Christ said you know sell everything you have pick your cross and follow me and it says something very which I think is very beautiful it says the man went away very sad because he had many possessions he couldn't do it he couldn't he wanted to I think he wanted to justify himself say I'm I'm doing I'm good I'm doing all all the things I need to do I should be okay and

[02:03:36] Christ kind of turned that on his head and said okay if you want to be perfect sell everything you have and come and follow me and I think I think what he's saying is look if you really want to be perfect really want to be happy you know get rid of I mean it's a bit of pine in the sky stuff in a way and not practical for for people but in some way get rid of your baggage and come and follow yeah because it could be metaphorically get rid of your stuff right I don't think it's necessarily literal right right it doesn't mean throw your couches out but it's be it means don't be wed to these things the way that I think we are exactly and the theological meaning is exactly that it's not that you can't have things but what's your attachment to those things you know is this thing where you put your values you know is your value in the car you drive and the what kind of beer you drink or whatever or is your value more in people and what you're doing and how you're helping people there is a a bit of values in that and I think I'm sure some people can do it very well they're very wealthy they have a lot of stuff but they're they do have a sense of Detachment from that I just think it's more difficult you it talks about this passage about it's more difficult for rich man to enter the Comm of Heaven than it is for a camel to go through the eye of the needle that's kind of something you say eye of the needle it's supposed to where the camels were and to keep them out of the out of the city that thing looked like an eye of an needle and the cam going go through there it's not saying being rich is bad or rich people are bad people that's totally that's I think that's missing the point it's just very difficult because it's very difficult to be detached from things when you have a lot of possessions you know I'm trying to say that without coming across as being judgmental I I don't mean that but certainly for me feel much better having less I really I really think that well it's funny at the outset you talked about this idea that even in college you were sort of struck by this idea if you wanted to be a missionary and you even said something to the effect of whatever that meant and it's sort of funny like if you say to me Peter picture a missionary I don't actually picture you

[02:05:29] I picture someone going into a remote part of the world and hitting people with Bibles right like that's sort of the image we have of a missionary but in the reality of it I think what you're doing is far more aligned with in as much as One Believes In in sort of religious values I I guess I think what people like you do that is regardless of one's religious views they can't help but respect it is you're not preaching to anybody you're not hitting anybody over the head with the Bible you're just sort of saying look I'm I'm here to serve you and your example is what's actually doing the talking as opposed to your words whereas I think most of us myself included are far too quick to use our words to speak as opposed to our actions well you're you're tapping into my favorite quote which has been attributed to St Francis I don't know if he St Francis is like many people he's my favorite Saint Francis bisi who lived in the 12 early 1200s he said preach always and sometimes use words and I think that's that's exactly what I think we try to do a mission show the love of

[02:06:35] Christ by who you are and what you're doing colus and don't don't get too wrapped around the axle about how it's going to play out remember if you're there as a missionary you know God is the one that changes Hearts not not me I'm not smart enough to do that I don't have the I'm not a guy that's going to have just the right thing to say and to you know School somebody on something I can't do that you know but I can do my best to show the love of Christ to these people and that's what I feel comfortable with you know if you ask me why I'm a Christian I can I can talk to you about it and even my words might be a bit jumbled and Goofy but preach always and sometimes use words are there any cases of suicide in nuba we had one guy who was the husband of one of our staff and uh yeah he he shot himself and that really shocked everybody he he seemed to have some kind of psychiatric problem he was kind of acting a bit strange a few days they didn't tell us but he he'd been in one of the in one of the refugee camps was acting a bit odd there came back to nuba and was acting a bit odd at home and then the night he was acting a bit odd he went and he shot himself as the only case I know of it's it's extremely rare extremely rare I mean to me there are so many amazing contrasts between nuba and America right I mean they're so obvious they're not worth stating it's these subtle ones that to me are interesting right there must be a different sense of fulfillment contentment happiness sense of purpose there versus here I mean as you know I'm sure you're not paying close attention to statistics in the United States but suicide is among the top 10 causes of death in every I may be incorrect on this but I'm not far off in every age demographic except for 0 to 10 so once you get above you know 10 to 20 20 to 30 suicide is always in the top 10 as a cause of a disease and that doesn't include that's what we call fast suicide right when you kill yourself immediately with a clear but then you have all the slow suicide so the alcohol related you know basically people that kill themselves with alcohol and drugs so when you include all of those I've heard analyses that would suggest that self harm would be sort of top five causes of death across the board what does that say to you given that you live in a world that has 1,000th of the privilege and for all intents and purposes like shouldn't everybody be killing themselves in nuba So to avoid being a you know ripped apart by shrapnel yeah it's very interesting and you know my the initial thought that comes to me is the people are when you're really gripped in this struggle to survive so your your life is based on you know every day is you're you're just trying to survive when you have that sort of Primal Instinct of survival you don't your mind doesn't Drift Off to other things you don't think about so much about your life is hard your life is this your life is miserable so I think you become less inward-looking suicide is so inward-looking so focused on your own misery that you can't come out of it I mean it's such a miserable thing I mean it breaks my heart when I hear about these things it really does because I think man to to get to that point when you just life is so miserable for you and you are so miserable you kill yourself it for me is heartbreaking does that break your heart more than the tragedy that you see every day I mean not to compare miseries but like what you see breaks my heart maybe I'm numb I mean and it's not to say that I'm not heartbroken by anybody who hurts thems but what you see is so staggering do you see this as an even greater source of tragedy for me I would I would equate that with the 5-year-old girl who's got the shrapnel ripping her arm off I would

[02:10:21] I I I would see I would feel the same sense of of pain and heartbreak with that suicide has a similar effect where you know if a child dies from this kind of thing the effect you have on the whole family is devastating the grief suicide the grief you leave behind I think that's really tough and that really really breaks my heart not only for the person who was so miserable that they decid to take their own life but for the people oh gosh and that's terrible man I would just never wish that on anybody and yet it's almost impossible in the United States to not have your life touched by Suicide I think it would be very rare that someone listening to this in America wouldn't know somebody first or secondhand who hasn't taken their life either clearly and deliberately or sort of slowly and maybe less deliberately yeah I think it's wrapped up in that struggle for survival there is a will you know a natural will to survive and when you're in this kind of daily grip even when there's when there's not fighting just to survive there the amount of work it takes to get up in the morning to you know make food to cultivate crops to keep the animals out of your garden I mean it's it's a it's a tremendous struggle there's a book I think the book is called trib Sebastian younger have you heard of yes I've heard of it I would love to read I can give you a copy actually I have a copy here so I'll give it to you as one more possession to have right um but he writes about how post 911 suicide rates went down in New York and he talks much more eloquently about this than I ever could but I guess it speaks to what you're saying which is when there's a real struggle when there's something and something that can bring people together in a common goal or or something that unites people it can presumably distract from some of that pain that can otherwise hurt us right and it's interesting because I fairly recently was hearing about this

[02:12:07] PTSD and and I mean how many veterans have killed themselves it's it's that's another heartbreaking thing somebody's fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan they survival that they come back back home they get desponded they kill themselves what kept them alive during the fighting was a sense of camaraderie togetherness fighting for you know for a common goal

[02:12:27] I mean no matter what you think about Warfare and the horrible things that happened in Warfare at least they have some kind of a common Bond they come back home to the US and people are indifferent to them nobody pays attention to them they've lost their the common bond with their with their comrades and friends and what ensues is despondency and before you know it we have this huge rate of suicide amongst veterans that come back not So Much from the trauma they had during the fighting you it wasn't like flashbacks to horrible things that happened there but the sense of loss of any bonds that human contact with other people that sense of purpose is gone so I found that quite interesting that that thought that's what it just makes you wonder if there was if there is a way to you know we have these dating apps here in the

[02:13:09] United States right you probably don't have a lot of them in newba well dating dating is is totally illegal there the word dating doesn't even exist in the well how did you meet your wife well we have what what she calls secret love that's not like in a in a scandalous sense for anybody but you know there you can't openly date somebody you know if if somebody like I I could never be alone with her somewhere like just chatting out in the public people would tell her brothers hey this guy is talking to your sister what are you going to do about it they come and they beat me up they'll beat her up and then this big Scandal and they say oh co you know either you guys going to get married or what's going on here just can't you can't be doing this so you have to do it we did it very quietly you know it's got It's it's difficult we got to know each other kind of on the side and are marriages normally arranged is that why this dating process is unnecessary yeah traditionally they were arranged now they're not so much arranged but the families will meet together somebody you know someone might show interest in somebody else then they have to approach the family but there's not really a dating they can't go through a public dating thing if you if you're interested in marrying a girl you've got to go and approach the family right away and say look I want to marry this woman then they have to start negotiations with do and all that all that sort of stuff you can't be seen together in public sphere it's just just totally not allowed so not so much AR range there there's some attraction between the two but they they have to really make the move fairly early so they don't you know one of the problems you don't really get to know the other person very well it's it's really difficult you know they're good and their bad points because you you're not really allowed to go through that that that process of dating it they know somebody and all that sort of thing and know the family all right so there's definitely no nuba version of Tinder um so so I think where I was going with that was in the same way that we have these dating apps it's which are basically trying to pair people right with similar interests at a meta level it's it would be interesting if if there would be a way to pair a void that exists here in this country and and for much of the Civilized world right the a void of Purpose with a part of the world where purpose is not lacking but resources are lacking and in many ways I think that's what philanthropy sort of tries to do but of course the question is it's more than just that right I mean

[02:15:14] I don't think it's just giving I think there's more to it right I mean I I and I was sort of thinking about this knowing we were going to speak today that because my daughter asked me another question she said you know she said well can you ask Dr Tom like what could a 10-year-old girl in San Diego do to help a 10-year-old girl in nuba MH and I thought and I thought and I thought and I was like I don't know MH cuz it's not like you going there is going to you know be a practical solution and or even provide value I mean even me even if I decided Tom please I'm going to come for a year and work at your side I would slow you down

[02:15:52] I mean I would be a waste of like you'd spend a year just teaching me how to get out of my own way so H how can people help I mean giving is of course the most obvious You' you've outlined so many clear tangible examples of where even modest Resources by the standards of our health care System would have profound step function changes there is there something else people can do to help yeah first of all never underestimate the value of a donation to to someone you trust or a group you trust or an organization you trust the amount the the impact that has it's tremendous we can't do anything in our work without

[02:16:30] Financial Resources beyond that I think one is just becoming aware of the situations somehow in this environment trying to understand how these people how they live what their lives are like that these really are individuals that have their own thoughts and as Inspirations and everything else trying to get into their skulls a bit and understand what their life is like and who they are if you have kind of a knack for advocacy or work through governments and this kind of thing be aware of the political situations there Advocate on behalf of some of these people that are oppressed or having difficult lives whether it's working in issues of poverty or poor health poor education I think people have a have a voice to offer and people do have an influence over governments so government policies

[02:17:19] Government funding is a reflection of the constituents and I just came to realize this full well in this trip because some of these people say well the government funding a lot of these administrative requirements these beneficiary organizations have become more stringent and more difficult because governments require these things because they're accountable to their constituents their constituents are saying why you sending so much money to

[02:17:42] Africa they're wasting it or it's a waste of money so to give the money out the constituents are holding the politicians feet to the fire if the constituents were a little more open said look Let's help out let's let's be aware what's going on and try to help some of these people get out of their misery so they can eventually help themselves through education Better

[02:18:02] Health all these sort of things that would free the politicians up a but a bit to allow more resources to go out into more more Aid and other things more benefit to get them I mean the goal in all this stuff is eventually let these people who are beneficiaries now stand on their own two feet maybe in the next gener ation next go around this cycle of

[02:18:20] Aid I mean everybody knows a cycle of Aid in dependency is is is a bad thing great but how do you get out of that so what are some creative ways we can do that but you can't do anything without some help at this point but geared towards getting these people to stand in own two feed talk to me about food I heard a funny story once that is there a word for food in huba like it it's like it gumo so you know nuba has uh I don't like 99 different languages amongst the inba people so but does everybody speak

[02:18:52] Arabic pretty much most speak Arabic you speak Arabic yeah I speak IA yeaha the da of my uh wife's language is Tia and this came from her the local word for food is gumo and you I say what did you have for supper last night and she said well I had food I said what kind of food she you know food what what are you talking about I ha food I said what kind said well I had AA you know AA is the kind of the it's like cake made out of sorghum kind of ground sorghum boiled just totally tasteless she loves it you I have to have my my ACA so for them the word food in in the C is synonymous the so little variety and so little variety of foods so what do you eat first of all what did you weigh cuz you were a nose guard in college I've seen pictures of you you were huge yeah what did you weigh in college in college

[02:19:44] I was 230 and this was 198 five by way 230 what did yeah what did you weigh when you arrived in Kenya in 2000 probably around 190 I would guess and what did you weigh by the time you got to nuba oh 08 then maybe 170 and I got down I was down about 150 up until recently now when I've come out for the past month I think I've gained about 20 pounds I was down about you gain 20 pounds in the United States in a month yeah so you were down to 150 pounds a month ago yeah talk to me about what you eat well that's the thing I I I eat but my wife makes the food there so it's this food which is the what did you eat before you got married then I was living on the hospital compound so we'd have a lot of um they would send them food in from Kenya normally like once a year they would send food in so usually rice uh kidney beans some kind of lentils so we'd have that every day once while we have chicken but usually it was just kind of rice and beans kind of stuff so now when I got married and moved off the compound my wife makes CA and she some sauce on top of it so the main sauce is this okra okra grows pretty well they take okra they dry it and they pulverize it into the powder they mix that in with water and some other stuff and it makes like a really slimy sauce that you pour over the the Sorghum paste and it tastes about as good as it sounds I mean it's really pretty bland where is the protein you know I think the Sorghum actually has a high protein level I think it's a grain and

[02:21:14] I'm saying that because the people are are pretty are pretty muscular like that's what they eat they eat that and they'll have maybe some sorum porridge in the morning and that's pretty much it for the day and I mean a few peanuts they have peanuts too but not huge numbers of peanuts what about fruits or other vegetables for fruits there are seasonal so you can get mangoes for maybe two or three months out of the year you know mango season is there there're tons of mangoes then they when they're gone they're gone you don't see a mango for several more months than there there two seasons for mangoes usually but they it varies quite a bit year to year so mangoes are there periodically lemons you can get for fruits that's about it oranges are not there you know pineapples are there tomatoes and tomatoes are there for a couple months sort of towards the end of the rainy season you can get tomatoes and you can get some some greens they grow a few kind of greens there and they'll put that on top of the like even the tomatoes will kind of cook up a bit and then make the uh okra slime to it and put that over the aeda that's not bad actually we'll have that quite a bit or the other thing we'll have during the rainy season is milk also milk is only there for a couple months the cows will only give birth during the rainy season and that therefore they're only lactating during the rainy season so they get milk sort of towards the end the rainy season those last couple months and since there's no Refrigeration most times we'll have it sour sour milk so get get milk out let it sit for a while and become sour that'll also decontaminate it a bit there's a lot of brucelosis there and you take the sour milk which is kind of curdled and you know I think people have had sour milk before and you pour that over the ACA over the Sorghum paste that just doesn't sound tasty it's not very good it's really it's you kind of eat it you're like oh man you know the problem is you eat it you're kind of hungry a bit but there's no way you're going back for a second like okay that was enough just got to go to bed you know or go back to work it's like okay guess I'm finished my wife really she does a great job cooking with what limited resources we have but it's pretty Stark is there is there a food that you particularly looked forward to having when you knew you were coming to the United States yeah like

[02:23:25] Italian right yeah so Pizza eggplant Parmesan is my favorite food in the world so my sister made that when I was down there hamburgers I just crave cheeseburger like just a good sandwich you know with some chicken sandwich or something is just really nice with a good bread you know this kind of stuff you've been sick when you're there I mean how many times have you had malaria well I've been there 10 and a half years so I've gotten malaria every year except for 2018 how bad is malaria it sounds awful it's pretty bad I mean you sometimes you're wishing somebody comes in and just shoots you and puts you out of your misery it's you're you're pretty sick with it it's worse than influenza right yeah an influenza anybody who's actually had the flu will attest that's 10 days of really bad living yeah

[02:24:08] Larry's pretty miserable I mean real bad headache nausea vomiting you can't sleep just high fevers body aches terrible body aches and sometimes you get a bit lucky you take medicine you're you're over it in a few days but you know a lot of times it'll drag on for a month but you don't take prophylaxis throughout the year just or during the rainy season which

[02:24:27] I'm assuming is when it's endemic right I don't I don't take prophylaxis just because of the cost and yeah I just don't want to take the drug I just want to say okay let me just not take it and if I take it once you get right once I get it sometimes it'll drag on a bit longer I mean sometimes you get just for a month you take the medicine you feel a bit better for a couple days then next evening you start feeling a CH chills and shaking and the headache comes again and it's like oh gosh still with me it can really drag on for a long time so every year you've got it every year I was in a coma a few years ago just uh

[02:24:59] God it was a strange night or I started feeling sick the night before is on a Tuesday night and started taking I took some oral drugs I think kartum which is um Arin and derivative took that at night I went to bed just kind of had a kind of fitful sleep and then I woke up the next morning and all these staff in my room I have an IV in my arm and I'm

[02:25:19] IV quinning like what what's going on here the doctor needed treatment that's right but I was really out of it it was like 11 o'clock when I woke up and I was really you know they tried to get me up in the morning some of the staff because I was in the operating room day on Wednesday and our guy that's our assistant there I didn't show up I know for the I was he was on there by 7:30 and I didn't show up so he came up to the room he tried to wake me up and I I couldn't get up like I didn't respond to him so he thought I was dead he was like hey El dead people came running in anyway I had die so I just uh that was out of it for quite a while but then I recovered pretty quickly I can't even imagine I just I when you think back Tom about all of the people you've taken care of in the last 10 or 11 years so just even just limiting it to to the time in nuba is there any one particular patient that just stays with you that haunts you one case one story one child one adult I mean I have those stories I've got one or two three probably three stories that have stayed with me from my training right that if I even think about these patients I'll tear up I mean just you know they unfortunately they're all bad outcomes as the ones that but they're also they're not like the only bad outcomes I've seen but there's just some there was some emotional connection that happened and then it's maybe it's sometimes you're projecting what's happening there onto your own life or something but do you have those cases yeah probably like you the ones you really remember are the ones that have bad outcomes or ones that didn't go well gosh we had one kid I remember he he came in on a Sunday morning and he had been the anof bombed in the shrap the went in his face and just tore his face to shreds and he went to some Clinic somewhere and they they put a few stitches in it like chromic stitches and it came a couple days after that and his face was just mangled so he took the stitches out and it was all just puss and dirt coming out I mean just they didn't but clean the wound out so we took all these stitches out clean the wound out well put them in some antibiotics a couple days later we go in he's got high fever and he can't swallow I'm like oh crap he's got he's got tetanus so we kick his tetanus

[02:27:23] I remember well the day before then I remember the anten off came overhead the anten off is the airplane that bombs and we saw the kid he was like a maybe 10 years old he was standing against the wall just shivering when he heard the airplane just shaking like this he was so traumatized so traumatized he was shaking like this then like the next day he gets a real high fever he can't swallow put him in isolation put NG tube down to feed him and he just died from tetus like overnight he died from ten this and I remember this kid's face and how and I say what the heck was a 10-year-old kid with this thing we had another kid this childood this a few years ago he was he was bombed he and his aunt and it was an incendiary bomb from the Antonov and I don't know what they had Napal or whatever but it bombed him it just he had I don't know he had 30 degree burns on probably 60 70% of his body and he Liv that's is that even survivable no he lived like two months with this and both he and his Z were the same and I mean we tried everything with these kids the amount of work the nurses did every day just to try to address him and the agony he went through before he died remember you know this his aun would have these scabs and I remember they were there were her eye was was burned with this thing and I remember there there were maggots coming out of her eye you know I think what what the heck are we doing you know it's just crazy what what who are the these are civilians burn to death you know there were other six other their kids that were in an area that was being shelled so the sedan Army would shell their Village like all night and then they would bomb during the day so they were at night time they would sleep in the foxholes for protection so right next to them was a straw Ruba kind of a straw little structure so the artillery shell fired and hit the Ruba thing burst Ruba is just like a kind of lean to with made of grass and wood it set this thing on fire and it fell into the

[02:29:14] Foxhole and there were I think people in the Foxhole all sleeping three were burned to death immediately six of them came to the hospital with VAR degrees of of burns I a couple were just like 80% full thickness Burns I mean just they lived for quite a while before they died two of them one girl started improving they developed tetus and die from the tetus so these are ones that really kind of stick out maybe one of the soldiers I remember best is a guy that he was a guy

[02:29:43] I think I told you before he he had 23 or four holes in his intestines we open him up and we just I mean we hours we operated in this guy posttop he was doing great I mean it was cruising started feeding him he set up in bed the next time called down to see him he's changed condition as they say and I went down there he's already dead he was he was a he was a a Dar fori who was fighting with the nuba rebels and I just remember thinking you know what what would this like for his like this guy's got a family you know he's fighting in this place his family somewhere in darur what's happening they have any idea with happening here so many terrible things you know there was a young one young kid he was about 16 and he the Sudan Army was encroaching in our area so the rebels ran out there to to kind of repulse them and then people just kind of jumped on vehicles to go out and fight you know so this kid just jumped on the vehicle he didn't have a gun weapon anything he just he was a civilian he goes out there he gets shot in the head with with you know machine gun or something he comes in with with you know part of his skull missing and and this brain tissue kind of pulsating out I mean he survived for two or three weeks like that we having steroids and different things antibiotics try to calm things down and ended up just kind of going south and dying so these are all all people will never forget and there are many many many beyond that if people want to get involved in any way shape or form where would you recommend they they look to as as a resource I think that like an Afric Mission Healthcare

[02:31:11] Foundation there was something on their website about the hospital that's one source to go to Catholic and their website is sf. Us www.

[02:31:33] amf.pw nuba movie which was made by my friend Ken Carlson which I I recommend everybody watch it I I think it's a um I'm sure it was done in a shoestring budget but it's so well done yeah you know it just sort of speaks for itself so anything raised through them goes to Afric Mission Healthcare which comes to us without anything taken out Catholic medical Mission board is another good source that's my they're my sponsoring organization they're here in New York they've been here for I think over 100 years and their cb.org I think is their website these are probably the main sources for our work in nuba you know

[02:32:06] I'll close with a story Tom that I think in many ways kind of defines you I remember um when I decided I wanted to go to medical school I was applying for this scholarship and in the end I didn't get the scholarship but I remember during the interview this guy asked me a question he said you know what do you want to be and at the time when I went to medical school I wanted to be a pediatric oncologist and uh I know what the guy was doing in retrospect I mean I think he was just trying to push me and he basically said like why would you want to do that you can't possibly make a difference you know without dedicating your life to research you're not going to have a difference saving one kid's life at a time etc etc and you know I remember thinking of a story after which in many ways exemplifies you to an extent that probably no one else which is you know in medicine you can do two things right you can you can do something very scalable through research you know you can devote yourself to to working on you know treatments for cancer or developing a new drug to treat this disease or that disease or you can be on the front lines trying to save one life at a time so the story is there's these two guys walking down the beach and it's after a really high tide and the beach is covered in starfish and the starfish are going to die pretty soon if they don't get back in the water which means they're pretty much all going to die the two guys are walking and every few steps one of the guys bends down as he picks up a starfish and he throws it back in the water five steps later he does it again and again and again after like the 10th one the one guy says to him he goes what are you doing and he says well you know if these starfish don't get back in the water you know they're going to die and he goes have you looked and seen how many of them there are here you can't possibly make a difference yeah and he throws another one in the water and he says well it made a difference to that one right and I think for doctors that don't have the privilege of being able to affect the larger through research or or policy changes whatever for people on the front lines I I don't think there's a human being on this planet who throws more starfish back in the water than you in the end medicine is individual it's the beauty of our profession and it's a huge privilege to have the the opportunity to affect one person and in the end you close the door and it's you and the patient whether you're in nuba mountains whether you're here in New York and that's an incredible privilege and I think if we keep that Focus just one person at a time I think people can kind of relax a bit you can see that what you're doing for that one person you know I think people look at Africa and say you know what you're doing is a drop in the ocean

[02:34:42] I really like that story because when you're there you don't see a drop in the ocean you see a person you see a life one at time you see a life and you see somebody that that can laugh and can cry and can play and can you know has aspirations and as a living breathing human being you think man we helped this one person that's a huge thing you know and I think that helps to Stave off some of the burnout and the cynicism the fact that you are this is a very individual thing so one person is really a big deal it's everything to that one person to that one person's family and uh

[02:35:16] I think we really have to keep that in mind especially with this growing realm of cynicism and sort of negativity that we see now Tom I have been wanting to meet you for three years I didn't know that I'd ever get a chance to so it's it's sort of Beyond a privilege and I know that for you being outside of nuba is the toughest thing imaginable which is of course the irony sitting here in the plush New York City and yet all you're doing is pining to go go back to a place where your own life is in danger but you know I remember thinking

[02:35:51] God I really just I'd love to be able to interview Tom and I remember thinking there's no way he could justify making the time to do this when his time in the US is so short so when I asked Rick and Mark and John and and they said that Tom would be happy to sit down I I just I couldn't believe it and and I might make the case that of all the interviews I've ever done or will do this is the one I feel most privileged to so thank you thank you so much yeah thanks Peter this has been a real privilege for me to be here with you and thanks for giving us the platform to spread the word a bit thank you so much thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive it's extremely important to me to provide all of this content without relying on paid ads to do this our work is made entirely possible by our members and in return we offer exclusive member only content and benefits above and beyond what is available for free so if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level it's our goal to ensure members get back much much more than the price of the subscription premium membership includes several benefits first comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic paper person and thing that we discuss in each episode and the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival hours second monthly ask me anything or AMA episodes these episodes are comprised of detailed responses to subscriber questions typically focused on a single topic and are designed to offer a great deal of clarity and detail on topics of special interest to our members you'll also get access to the show notes for these episodes of course third delivery of our premium newsletter which is put together by our dedicated team of research analysts this newsletter covers a wide range of topics related to longevity and provides much more detail than our free
