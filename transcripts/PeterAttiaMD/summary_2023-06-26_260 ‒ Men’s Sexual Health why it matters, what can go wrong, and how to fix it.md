Mohit Khera is a urologist with expertise in sexual medicine. In this episode, he provides an overview of male sexual health. He first goes in-depth on erectile dysfunction, shedding light on its prevalence across different age groups, diagnostic methods, and its intriguing connection to cardiovascular disease. He then ventures into Peyronie's disease, penile fractures, penile enlargement treatments, prolonged erections, premature ejaculation, and anorgasmia. Mohit then delves into the intricate workings of testosterone, DHT, and estrogen, emphasizing their physiological significance and interplay. He explains blood tests for diagnosing low T, the correlation between symptoms and blood levels in cases of low T, and the various methods for increasing testosterone. He concludes with a conversation about the role of testosterone in patients with prostate cancer and addresses concerns surrounding DHT, finasteride, and post-finasteride syndrome.
