## Transcript

[00:00:00] Let's talk a little bit about a brain computer interface. >> There's this large and growing field that we call neuroengineering that is really trying to use computers uh sensors chips in order to interpret eavesdrop on how the neurons are signaling to each other regardless of their you know pathology or the biology but just what are they saying to one another. Can we eaves drop on that? Can we interpret it? Can we decode it?

[00:00:34] And then more importantly, can we use that information actually to guide you know sort of more normal signaling? Uh why this is potentially important is that at the end of the day, the function is from that electrical activity. It's the propagation of those action potential by neurons which gives rise to our thoughts, our ability to communicate, our ability to walk, move our arm. um without that it's not there.

[00:01:00] So um I would say neuroengineering as a complement to the biological or pharmaceutical approaches. >> How would you explain this to somebody at a party if they said but what you know that that that sounds pretty high-tech but what is it? >> Okay. Um well um okay so let's just break apart the terms. Uh brain refers to really any kind of thing that interfaces with the cortex or the deeper structures. Uh the computer is a digital device on the outside. Um a lot of people now call this BCI, brain computer interface for short. Um it's a very messy term um because it could mean a lot of different things but I think in a nutshell what it means is for most people a system that is recording from the brain whether it's non-invasive from the scalp or something that's fully invasive like within the brain itself and connecting those signals to a computer that analyzes the signal and then does something with it. In many cases of uh BCI research, the application is uh for example to remove a computer cursor or uh in the research that we've done is to replace speech words for someone who's severely paralyzed and unable to talk anymore.

[00:02:24] And so it's about interpreting brain signals >> and then using a computer to um interpret those signals and then um transform them into a form that's useful to us. >> So in that example you gave, you're describing a patient with aphasia who can't speak. >> Um let me be very specific about that. So a lot of the work that we've done is on people that have a severe form of paralysis. and ephasia we typically I see >> refer to as someone who's got let's say a stroke >> y >> um in the language centers of the brain where we've focused recently is on patients that have a severe form paralysis like ALS so there the problem is they have largely normal language but they can't get those >> can't get the motor signal out >> can't get the motor signal out to the vocal tract the lips the tongue the jaw the larynx those descending fibers are severely affected by ALS they degenerate. >> Y >> and that's why people progressively become paralyzed and lose ability to speak. >> And an important part of that is that they lose ability to speak but they still have full cognition. >> Yeah.

[00:03:34] And for that individual, by attaching a computer to their brain, you're able to hopefully extract in written cursive text, you know, whatever across the computer screen what they're wishing to say. >> That's right. >> Okay. Let's talk about how that could possibly be done. Um, you mentioned earlier there are two at least two broadly, you know, two broad ways to extract that information. A non-invasive way where presumably you're putting electrodes all over a head that's as well shorn as mine. Um, alternatively, a very invasive way where you actually remove the scalp and you lay these things on the cortex itself. Correct. >> Yeah. So the range would be EEG which is where sensors are placed on the scalp directly recording non-invasively. You can remove them at any time. And then the far other extreme is uh electrodes that are actually placed into the brain.

[00:04:37] The most >> ECOG >> um ecog would be electrodes that are on the brain surface. That's short for electrocorticography. And that's where we've done the vast majority of our work in my lab. Um >> and that's just placed on the surface of the cortex under the dura on the cortex. >> That's absolutely correct. Yeah. So what's nice about that is that you don't have um the injury to the brain itself from the insertion of the electrodes. >> Um it's a stable recording over time. We now use ECOG devices to essentially help people with seizures, for example, where you can basically have a pacemaker now that records from the brain service and then stimulates to help stop the seizures. Um, >> and this is a fully implanted device. >> Um, it's moving towards that. So, the work that we've done in our clinical trial is using an array that's surgically placed but connected through uh a port. We call it a perccutaneous board because it's actually physically attached uh and anchored to the skull.

[00:05:36] It's an array on the brain. It comes out the dura and is anchored in the skull. Um and then exit the body >> uh right on the top of the scalp. >> How do you prevent infection with such a close? >> Yeah, it's a really good question and that's what the main problem with this early prototype um BCI and it's our group. There's other groups around the world that are using similar things primarily to show if you know it's possible actually to decode brain activity for uh useful purposes. So what's happening right now >> in the field is a lot of these technologies are now going to become wireless over time. But you're absolutely right. One of the main reasons is that we want to move away from the perccutaneous. We want to move away from the ports which are infection risks uh on top of other problems and uh move to things that are fully implantable uh fully wireless. >> How long do you feel you're away from that? >> Um basically about a year. >> Okay. >> Yeah, >> we've been working on it for uh for quite some time. And so, um, it's a really interesting time where we're seeing a convergence of like what's possible with electrical engineering, you know, high bandwidth wireless processor way beyond what we can do with

[00:06:53] Bluetooth. Um, uh, advanced electronics that now allow us to print some of these sensors on a substrate that is thinner than a piece of paper, really, really small, and on a substrate that can conform to the convolutions. um you know the different u peaks and valleys of of the you know human cortical surface. >> So what is the trade-off between ECOG and sensors inserted directly in the brain? >> Yeah. >> What's the resolution difference? >> Um well that's a very important question that we and many other people are trying to figure out right now. Um most of the time when people are putting an electrode into the brain um there has to be some gain for that and usually that's for recording a higher resolution usually trying to record the activity of single neurons a single cell. >> H how how can you isolate a single cell? >> Yeah. Really small electrodes.

[00:07:56] Super small electrodes. Um and that's we we do a lot of work with this in our research. The challenge for the field um has just been that it's very hard to stably record from single cells more than a couple of hours or days. So that's one challenge. The other pro challenge is that when you put the electrodes into the brain, it can create a reaction. um those gal cells that we talked about at the very beginning, those support cells, they actually have immune function as well, they detect that there is a foreign body and they'll activate and they'll react to it, create a scar around the electrodes. So the advantage of having electrodes in the brain to do this very microscopic kind of recording is that you can get a finer signal from single cells. The disadvantage is that it can create a reaction that reduces the fidelity of those signals over time.

[00:08:53] One of the reasons we've been most interested in using these sensors on the brain cortex is that we've learned over time that if you don't have the electrodes penetrating through the peel surface of the cortex, that's the outermost um very thin membrane that's covering the cortex. If you don't have anything going through that, you can avoid a lot of those immune reactions, avoid a lot of that scarring, preserve the function uh that's underlying. But this is something that we're actively trying to understand. So just to give me a sense of magnitude if

[00:09:27] EEG on the surface is one one unit of resolution what would ECOG be and what would uh implanted electrode be is it 1 10 100 what what's the scale at which you're thinking of resolution >> well I would say uh from the scalp let's say we just arbitrarily call that one >> y >> you know and then you think about what you could do with the CECOG

[00:09:53] I think we're really talking about let's say you know a thousand times better resolution. We've been a able to answer very fundamental questions actually about how the brain works using those kind of surface recordings in a way that's impossible with surface uh scalp electrodes. >> Wow. >> And then once you go take that further to single neurons then you've got another resolution probably six to five uh five 5,000. So there is a benefit.

[00:10:20] The big jump is just going from an EEG to an ECOG >> directly. That's a three log change, whereas you're a 5x change going deeper. >> And so, um, one of the reasons for that is >> the skull and the scalp, >> uh, are a major loss of signal. >> Yeah. >> Um, the signals are small to begin with, so once you're trying to interpret them through the scholar scalp, they're basically gone and very diffuse, too. So trying to understand like where they came from in any precise way is almost impossible. Um when you're recording directly on the surface you're basically at the source itself. Um the cellular level the single cell recordings are terrific for trying to understand that ultra fine resolution primarily uh in in the case that we use them for is for research primarily to understand you know what's happening at those units. But still to this day, there's really no way that you can chronically and stably record from the same cells, you know, over uh days >> because of the immune reaction. >> Um also because of how fine uh of a problem it is, like how um precise it has to be. Um we're talking about a single cell, you know, a couple of microns. Yeah. >> In uh diameter, and you've got an electrode. any microotion at all, anything changes that. And so typically what we see with a lot of those systems that record from those is that there's a lot of turnover from day to day or hour to hour. >> Meaning you're drifting between which neuron you're recording in? >> That's exactly right. >> Okay. >> Yes. >> Does that imply then that I mean just taking a step back, you said 82 billion neurons in our brain. So you put the probe into one and it moves over to the next one and the next one and the next one. One like me would naively assume they're all the same. Like you know th those are like three row homes that are basically all identical on the upper west side. Like that's we're not talking about Tribeca here. >> Does it really matter if the probe moves between those three? >> Um >> sounds like the answer is yes, but I'm curious as to why. >> The answer is yes. Um, and because we we now know that, you know, cells that are right next to each other can have some very different information. Now, that being said, when you go through a column of the cortex, a column is this vertical organization.

[00:12:50] Um, typically what we we're thinking about when we look at is the two dimension of the surface, but there's a third dimension of information processing, which is the different layers of the cortex we call the lamina. And typically in some of the sensory areas, for example, if you put an electrode, it's primarily going to be tuned to the same information across those different neurons across that depth. So you're right, in certain areas, you may have neurons that are tuned to the exact identical thing. And for decoding purposes, that may actually not be a big deal to have it not, you know, not very stationary over time. In other instances where you're trying to code from areas where it's a lot more intermix, it could have really profound implications where you have to recalibrate the algorithms that the machine is doing to interpret the signals, you know, every couple of hours or days. >> So when you do ecog, how do you direct the sensor at the part of the brain you want to go to? Because

[00:13:49] I assume it has to be far more nuanced than just where you slap it on the cortex. >> Yeah. Um, we're definitely getting into details and I love that Peter you um you're not afraid of getting into the details and so um this is one of the actually the um alludes to one of the things we were talking about earlier.

[00:14:10] The part of my brain and the part of your brain that is responsible for speaking especially in the motor control part is largely the same. It's in the same ballpark. Um there's a lot of variation when we come down to the details. the micro geography, but it's in the same it's like largely in the same city if we're talking about geography. Um, where your house is versus my house, etc., that's going to be a little bit varied within that. Um, one of the nice features about using ECOG or electrocortography is that you can put an array over that entire area safely and you can sample very very densely across the other, you know, across the entire city, let's say. And so it doesn't really matter actually at the end of the day if one person's there and the others. Um, >> that seems to actually be a feature, not a bug, right? Right. I mean, the bug is you give up the resolution at what's happening in the kitchen of that house, but you now get to look at all the houses. >> Exactly. And you get to do it in a way that's very safe and scalable. >> And you're only I mean, the biggest thing you give up is 20. You give up 80% of the resolution roughly. But yeah, so with ECOG, tell me how many words per minute you could capture from a patient with ALS.
