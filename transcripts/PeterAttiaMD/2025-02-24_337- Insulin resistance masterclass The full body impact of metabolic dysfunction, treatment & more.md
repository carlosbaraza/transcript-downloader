## Transcript

[00:00:00] talk a little bit about what insulin resistance is basically every time you eat a meal you're going to release insulin there are many processes that insulin control so one of the challenges with the term insulin resistance is as you said it's a vague term and it's non-specific there two problems in diabetes one is you don't make enough insulin the other is your insulin resistant type two diabetes you're knocking on death's door correct you're going to go blind y you're going to have your toes amputated you're not ever going to have an erection again and you're going to die of cardiovascular disease or kidney disease or Alzheimer's disease quickly some people say that Alzheimer's disease is you know Diabetes Type 3 I'm not sure I brain diabetes yes you are obese when you're 4 years of age you're going to be obese when you're adult and your life expectancy will be significantly shorter and your quality of life will be significantly reduced what has changed so much in the last 30 years that has created this epidemic hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:08] AA Ralph thank you so much for coming down to I guess up to Austin from San Antonio um very excited to sit down with you and talk about uh you know potentially one of the most important subject matters in all of Health uh people who listen to me all the time here and are familiar with me talking about these four horsemen right cardio uh cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease cancer uh neurodegenerative and dementing diseases and then there's this fourth Horseman that I talk about and it's in many ways the squishiest because it's not the one that shows up on the most death certificates um but in many ways it's the foundational one that is amplifying the risk of all of those other causes of death and I refer to it as you know sort of metabolic disease spanning the

[00:01:55] Spectrum from hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance to fatty liver disease all the way out to type 2 diabetes um so given how much I speak about that it seems very important that we should have a really uh thorough discussion of that foundational metabolic disease and no one better than you to have that discussion so let's start a little bit with just kind of telling folks briefly about you know what you're doing at UT San Antonio and why you've spent the last 40 plus almost 50 years now working on this problem so for me I actually have been sort of in this field of metabolic disease for a long time um I I think I'm the longest consecutively funded 53 years niddk uh investigator uh and uh I actually started even long before that uh when I was a medical student uh in at Harvard I had this fantastic teacher Professor

[00:02:55] Cahill who gave us all of the lectures on intermediary metabolism and I decided this is what I wanted to do uh and I worked each summer with professor kahill and uh you know sometimes in life you meet the right person the right opportunity it changes everything you do and basically what I do now I contribute the directly to

[00:03:16] George and you know when I gave the Banting lecture in 2008 people usually you know put a picture of their mother and father and children and I love my mother and father and children but I only showed one picture and that was professor kill because he's really the person who's ended up sort of directing me to where I am today you know people who are listening who are particularly astute Might Recall um I've referenced a number of kah Hill's uh papers but one of the more interesting studies he did which it's possible he did while you were even a student there was the 40-day starvation study um now you might have not been quite at Harvard yet because this was if I recall in the mid-60s

[00:03:58] Maybe 6667 where and it was probably a group of medical students that actually volunteered if not medical students undergrads and they they they did a water only fast for 40 days and the study basically just followed all of the metabolites what happened to glucose levels obviously insulin beta hydroxy butter aceta acetate anyway it was very fascinating stuff one of the things that was most interesting to me in that study was even under a period of such extreme starvation the brain never gave up its dependency on glucose so even though Ketone bodies began to um service the brain by about day 7 to 10 as the majority of the fuel even at three and four weeks of starvation glucose was if my memory serves me correctly still providing about a third of the brain's energy your memory is very good the brain did switch over to

[00:04:50] Ketone metabolism and believe it or not I didn't do the 40-day fast but I was one of the people who fasted for 5 to 7 days uh and if you fasted for 3 Days uh you could get paid $50 and I thought I was the richest guy in the world uh from this study so I can assure you that the physical specimens in this study were phenomenal uh what did the 40-day fasting students get uh I don't know but

[00:05:20] I'm sure he paid them a lot of money that's amazing in order to do that and the interesting thing about that is you realize that we have so much energy stored in the human body who would have thought that you know you're a lean type person you can you know fast for 40 days but the real problem is at some point you start to break down muscle and then if you start to break down cardiac muscle then prolonged fasting at that point becomes a problem but you have a lot of energy stored in fat and uh you can uh starve for a long time and obese people easily can go for 3 four months uh with all the reserves that are in the body well let's maybe talk a little bit about um what insulin resistance is um I we'll get into what causes it um but but let's just maybe Define for people this term that gets thrown around constantly and and let's you know explain what it is from a technical standpoint Yeah so basically every time you eat a meal uh and your blood sugar level goes up you're going to release insulin and insulin is sort of a master regulator for all uh biochemical processes in the body so one of the things that insulin is going to do is going to talk to your muscles and going to say take up glucose and uh burn that uh glucose uh so what we need to know is in a normal person when to infuse insulin uh how much uh of the glucose is taken up by the muscle and then we could look at someone who is say overweight or we could look at someone who's diabetic and I actually developed the gold standard technique which is the insen clamp technique to look at this so we could take an obese person or a diabetic or a normal person we raised the insulin and then I'm using muscle as an example how much uh glucose is taken up disposed of by the muscle and then I can compare if you're overweight compared to the lean person well obese people are very insulin resistant in terms of muscle glucose uptake I could look at the diabetic they're even more insulin uh resistant but there are many processes that insulin control so insulin regulates uh how much uh fat is uh released from your fat cells and obese people unfortunately insulin keeps the fat in your fat cell but in obese people insulin doesn't work so well so instead of keeping the fat in the fat cell even though your insulin is high you're breaking down the fat so you have to look at each individual process that insulin is controlling and so for that process we know this is what a normal person should respond like this is what a diabetic responds like and the diabetic is much much more insulin resistant they're not responding uh so it's in a certain way it's a general term because insulin controls so many uh things protein metabolism insulin is very important in helping you to build protein uh so I could Infuse insulin and we've done this using carbon labeled

[00:08:25] Lucine and we can Define how insulin promotes protein metabolism in a normal healthy person and then I could do the same kind of study in an obese person and we know that the obese people don't respond to the insulin as well in terms of aggregating protein metabolism uh so it's kind of a general term and does that translate not just to structural proteins such as enzymes uh or cellular structural proteins but also macro structural proteins such as muscle uh absolutely so uh I I can look at specific enzymes within the cell I can look at certain genes within the cell that are turned on or off or I can look at muscle in terms of muscle as a bulk uh so uh there are many as I said many ways in which you could Define insulin resistance but basically whatever the particular process you're looking at you're comparing what would be the normal response uh in a normal healthy person compared to what might happen in a diabetic person or an obese uh individual so one of the challenges with the term insulin resistance is as you said it's a vague term and it's nonspecific because the actions of insulin are so many it has an action in the liver it has an action in the muscles it has an action with response to glucose it has an action with response to amino acids and it has an action with response to Fat both in the liberation of fat uh lipolysis and presumably in response to oxidation absolutely and we'll go through all of these but let's Maybe start with um how the euglycemic clamp test is done and uh let's assume that I'm a healthy enough individual that we can use me as a proxy

[00:10:10] I come into your clinic um what are we going to do how do you run this test yeah so let me bring you back in time when I was a fellow because at that time we didn't really have a good measure of insulin sensitivity so what people would do is you do an oral glucose tolerance test yes and the insulin level would go up and so then some people would say

[00:10:32] I'll look at how much insulin comes out compared to the rise in glucose and that's a measure of beta cell function and then someone would just turn it around and say look I'm going to see how much the rise in glucose was per insulin and that's a measure of insulin resistance and it was very clear to me well this is insane you can't take two variables and then just depending upon how you want to look at them switch uh denominator numerator so I said need to develop something uh that is really more specific and just to be clear Ralph I mean unfortunately we as clinicians are not able to do ug glycemic clamps correct so we are still looking at Oral glycemic uh tolerance tests we are still giving people you know oral glucose and sampling glucose and Insulin every 30 minutes and trying to impute what we can which I'd love to come back and talk about interpretation but carry on with the with the limitation we could do that because we actually have done a lot of work on how you interpret that so what we said is why don't we develop a serious way and so we developed the technique where I could take 100 people and I would Infuse insulin initially as a priming dose and then just clamp the insulin level so I give a prime continuous insulin infusion I can take a 100 people and all 100 people I can raise your insulin level uh by 100 micro units per ml uh and I can do that for two hours and now I know that the stimulus the insulin stimulus whether you're lean whether you're obese or whether you're diabetic the whatever particular process that I want to look at so maybe I wanted to look at how insulin shut down a p of glucose production and actually we were the first people to ever use radioisotopes to trace this and show that in normal people insulin shut down glucose production by the liver very quickly but obese people and diabetics were very very resistant to the insulin then we said we wanted to know look everybody now has got the same insulin level uh how effectively does that insulin uh stimulate muscle glucose uptake and again what we showed and these actually were the very first unequivocal demonstration that uh diabetic people type two were insulin uh resistant before this there was a lot of controversy you know Dr Ren who's sort of the father of insulin resistance I like to think I'm the the son of Dr he's a a great Idol of mine uh he really was one of the very first people uh to insinuate that diabetics were insulin resistant now with the insulin clamp we showed this very definitively and we also know uh we use the labeled uh glycerol and free fatty acids and we could show the ability of insulin to shut down release of uh lipid from uh the fat cell was markedly uh impaired uh so three of the major organs all of this work originally was done by us when

[00:13:35] I was back at Yale so let's summarize those again we're talking about this in an insulin sensitive person right out of the gate insulin is going to shut down hepatic glucose output absolutely so it's which again all of this kind of makes sense if you think through the pathway our liver is constantly putting glucose into circulation because the muscles can't put glucose into circulation so something has to feed the brain yes absolutely if insulin is high it suggests glucose is already sufficiently high so let's not create more glucose toxicity let's shut that yeah the second thing it's going to do is it's going to take that excess glucose and put it in the place where we have the largest capacity to store it which is muscle absolutely so point two is we increase muscle uptake of glucose and then point three you said was it's going to shut down lipolysis yes it's going to shut down the release of triglycerides Andor free fatty acids from the adapost tissue Y and that's very critical and we also when we did these studies we would put a catheter in the TIC vein and in a femal artery in

[00:14:41] Emeral vein so we could look at the individual tissues and what we showed is that when you infuse insulin say 80 or 90% of the glucose is going to be taken up in muscle only 10% is going to be taken up in the atpa site and stored and how much in the liver uh basically none under ug glycemic conditions and we were the first to show this conclusively as well there's no glucose uptake in the liver by insulin just explain to people what a ug glycemic condition means ug glycemic means your fasting glucose when you wake up in the morning is 80 uh now you're ug glycemic uh that means when we do the studies we keep you fasting glucose of 80 we don't let the glucose change all we're going to do is raise the insulin and that means you're giving glucose of course because we didn't give glucose then your blood sugar level would drop and then you'd release cortisol you release epinephrine yeah so

[00:15:36] I just want to make sure people understand that I was going to come back to that but I wanted to not I wanted you to finish that point so let's let's make sure we go back to the test because it's very counterintuitive so I've got a catheter in each arm I walk in off the street I've been fasting uh my my blood sugar is 80 or 90 whatever milligrams per deciliter it is you are going to have to infu infuse both insulin and glucose into each of my arms and the reason is when you said a moment ago you're going to steadily increase my insulin and take it to a steady state of 100 IU per micro per per that's a staggeringly high insulin level not so high in your ey after a meal would be maybe 60 obese people very commonly get to 100 sure for a healthy person they would never see an insulin level that high and if you were not simultaneously running glucose into them you would kill them within minutes hopefully not yeah but but but just to to get to the point of they would become so profoundly hypoglycemic that they would cease to exist and it should be obvious that if you're very sensitive to insulin I have to infuse a lot of glucose but the other beauty of it as I said uh when when I was a young guy at Yale there was a physician uh in New York Dr Al Shuler he was the first one to use treated glucose to trace metabolic pathways and I said oh this is astounding so I actually went to visit Dr aler and learned how he did it and so all of the insulin clamp studies that we did we were the first people to use trated glucose in humans uh and to show that the ability of insulin to shut down the release of glucose from the liver was markedly impaired and this is s just again sorry to interrupt but just to make sure the people are following us the reason you wanted to use trated glucose there was not to quantify the total amount of glucose disposal you could do that on mass balance you wanted to determine the ultimate fate of glucose how much became hepatic glycogen if any sounds like the answer is none how much became muscle glycogen sounds like you said about 90% and how much ultimately got converted through denova lipogenesis into atoy free fatty acid sounds like that's about 10% under the ug glycemic condition is that correct yeah in general that's correct except in the muscle remember some of of the glucose is going to be oxidized so if you look at the glucose once it gets into the cell oneir would go through the glycolytic pathway and be oxidized right away uh yes and and the other 2/3 would be stored as uh glycogen now what if the person is I mean presumably you're doing this test and a person is sedentary yes so how is the and muscle is it is muscle that metabolically active at rest I guess it is yes yeah so that's really interesting does that mean you're increasing energy expenditure under these condition I well of course uh in a certain way you are but it's not like when you go out and you exercise and you run a mile or two uh so uh you know uh there it's a I I would say uh you are turning on a number of Cycles which are of course going to increase energy expenditure you're generating ATP uh so there is a certain increase in energy expenditure but if I really want to increase energy expenditure I'd get you to go jog 5 miles or so because exercise is really the thing that really increases energy expenditure and Ralph just for a sense of amount if you're doing this in say somebody my size who's insulin sensitive how many actual grams of glucose would you be able to get into the person within the hour while whilst keeping insulin clamped yeah so uh I'm going to do it first in terms of rates the way we express it and then I'll translate that so it's uh under basil conditions you wake up in the morning and your liver is producing and your tissues are taking up about 2 milligram per kilogram body weight per minute okay uh so I say that again liver is producing that's atic glucose output that's a glucose out part 2 mgram per kilogram body weight per minute and we were the first to actually show this many years ago and this is humanss mice are very very different totally different and that's why extrapolating from mice to humanss can be a problem let's just reflect on that for a second this this people who listen to this podcast are probably sick of me saying this but I'm sorry I just can't stop saying it the liver never ceases to amaze me right like I mean it's an incredible organ it's an unbelievable organ and again I come back to this idea it's the only major organ for which we don't have extracoporeal support right interesting yeah if your heart if you went into cardiogenic shock and we felt we could you know reverse it in time we could put an intra aortic balloon pump in you we could put an iabp in you um we could we could put a a left ventricular advice device in you to to to stem you over until we get you out of there if your kidneys are destroyed we can transiently di dilize you even if your brain is experiencing swelling we can you know put enough steroids in you or decompress your skull to give you uh the time to recover and keep you alive otherwise you go through all the major organs if your spleen is dinged take it out right um even if you lost your small bowel we could at least transiently keep you alive with you know uh tpn or something like that none of this is true with the liver you know in the old days um they actually used to use pig liver profusion

[00:21:15] I know uh but that was in the old days we don't do that uh anymore uh so in baboon as well in baboons yeah so so again the the fact that the liver can titrate this amount is remarkable so 2 Mill per kilogram per minute so you take an individual who weighs 100 kilog you're putting 200 mg per minute of glucose into circulation then you can multiply that by however minutes you want to look so so that's a gram every 5 minutes that's 12 G of glucose every hour that the liver is putting out but now when I do an insulin clamp depending on how much I raise the insulin and over the years we've done the dose response uh curve and I can come back to this because your fat is exquisitly sensitive to insulin if I raise the insulin just by 10 microts per ml the uh fat stops producing uh free fatty acids and glycerol you inhibit lipolysis literally uh uh completely uh the liver you need to get uh the insulin up to about 50 micro units per ml to really get it shut down so and the fat you had to get how high 10 a rise of 10 a rise of and and tell me these people when they come in and healthy they're at what they're at 5 to 10 faster they're at 5 to 10 so I'm going to raise them from 5 to 10 to maybe 15 or 20 and that's going to in large part shut down lipolysis okay uh and in fact all of this sort of work was work that we originally did many many years ago uh now at the level of the liver you really need to get up to about 50 micro units per ml so maybe I'm at 10

[00:22:57] I'm going to bring you up to 50 and that's in large part going to shut off glucose production by the liver now that's critical because you know you wake up in the morning and your liver is producing glucose now if you eat a meal glucose is coming in from the gastrointestinal tract you can't have glucose coming in from the liver at the same time otherwise you get very hypoglycemic so when you eat a meal and that insulin comes out it really needs to shut down a p of glucose production now what's replacing the liver is what's coming from the meal but then after you absorbed all of the meal the liver needs to turn back on so understanding how the liver is responding to insulin is really very important and then if I want to look at what's going on in the muscle the reason why we go to 100 micro per ml which is it's above physiologic but it's still within the physiologic range uh and uh you really need to get if you really want to stimulate muscle glucose uptake completely in a normal healthy person you'd probably have to get the plasma insulin to about 200 micro units per ml but in reality I'm sorry at 200 what happens mic you you have now maximized muscle glucose uptake but in reality even in an insulin sensitive person ye yes and just to make sure I understand what you're saying you're saying that if you took an insulin sensitive individual at 100 units of insulin versus 200 you will actually drive more glucose uptake you haven't saturated the glute for transporter at 100 yeah probably about 20 or 25% more uptake as you go from 100 to 200 wow and these are all early studies that uh we did uh uh so when we talk about insulin resistance that's why

[00:24:43] I said you need to know which tissue you're talking about and which metabolic pathway and if you want to talk about enzymes you need to talk at what specific enzyme because uh insulin resistance needs to be related to the tissue you're talking about in the process within the tissue that you're talking about so insulin resistance is a very important concept uh but you all have to be a little bit more specific about what aspect you you want to address so you can have insulin resistance in the fat cell you can have insulin resistance in the liver you can have insulin uh resistance in the muscle and then something that's now pretty exciting you may have insulin resistance in the brain and the suggestions now and there are many insulin receptors in the brain Jesse Roth you know very famous diabetes person you know maybe 50 or 60 years ago was the first to describe ins some receptors in the brain and this is an area that's now starting to unfold it may have some relationship to neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer's disease you know some people say that

[00:25:47] Alzheimer's disease is you know Diabetes Type 3 I'm not sure I diabetes yes so that that insulin resistance is a very important concept and unfortunate and I would say in in in the let's say we're going to talk about diabetes the even though there's an ominous octet that I develop that's used everywhere in the world for the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes if we really wanted to take and solid solidify it and say what are the two big Concepts insulin resistance would be here on the other hand would be impaired beta cell function okay so if you are insulin resistant and your beta cell work well they know how to read the insulin resistance they'll make enough insulin you won't become diabetic the hyperinsulinemia can damage you in other ways but you won't become diabetic but what happens is if you're insulin resistant and particularly if you have a genetic predisposition if your beta cells have to continuously pour out insulin they start to exhaust uh and so insulin resistance is a disaster for someone who has a genetic predisposition it's going to bring out uh the diabetes insulin resistance in my opinion is intimately related to cardiovascular disease that is why when you you see a diabetic patient 10% of them you walk in you have diabetes first time I see you 10% 15% of the people already have clinically significant cardiovascular disease and if you look carefully virtually 100% of them do and sorry

[00:27:21] Ralph do you think that that is a result of the hyperinsulinemia or the untreated or poorly treated hyperglycemia all of the above but more importantly what we showed and we were again the first people to show this H and the cardiologist they're kind of hemodynamically oriented they're looking at you know vessels strally colling but if you look at the insulin signaling pathway insulin has got a bind to its receptor and then there's a siging pathway I can tell you all the molecules in there which I'm not and then glucose gets transported in the cell we were the first people show in humans that that pathway doesn't work normally insulin will bind to the receptor it will activate the receptor but the next molecule irs1 pi3 kinus all those molecules don't get activated so glucose doesn't get into the cell that's diabetes that same pathway activates nitric oxide synthase and that generates nitric oxide nitric oxide is the most potent vasod dilator in the human body it's the most potent anti enic molecule in the human body so this defect that's in muscle uh and it's in cardiac muscle and it's in skeletal muscle this all human data that I'm I'm talking about not animal data when you get a defect in that insulin siging pathway that's going to cause diabetes and it's going to promote cardiovascular disease and that is why you can never separate cardiovascular disease uh from diabetes now as you pointed out right from so you know I believe that high levels of insulin are also aerogenic now I don't want people saying Dr defano said you shouldn't be giving insulin to people who need it of course uh if people need insulin you need to give them insulin but our beta cells make 35 units of insulin per day if you're a type 1 diabetic and again true what what do you mean uh so you during the you're going to have your breakfast you're going to have your lunch you're going to have your dinner and if I were to add sorry 35 units I thought you meant micro units got it yeah course of 35 units of insulin so we showed this many years ago when I actually was at Yale that if you were to take a type 1 patient and they were lean they would only need 35 or 40 units of insulin to get their uh glucose controlled assuming you gave the doses at the right time but we have a lot of people who are taking a 100 units of insulin both type ones and type twos so 3x physiologic yes that kind of hyperinsulinemia I think there's evidence to support that's atherogenic but now we have a problem okay can you have the glucose remain high yeah it's a question of do you want to die quickly or or slowly because we have really good drug yes yes but if you were only doing this with insulin be a problem it's an awful trade-off it's you're going to die very quickly from hyperglycemia if you're left untreated but if we overdo it with insulin to maintain normal glycemia we're going to kill you slowly you're stuck you have to treat but you also know that when you're giving these big doses of insulin there may be some side effects this is something Ralph I don't think that has been necessarily appreciated by the medical community has it oh absolutely not yeah there has generally been an ethos of when I've talked to patients with type two diabetes um that what they've been told is I'm told to cover with as much insulin as is necessary to maintain my glucose levels uh in this range and it means I can eat whatever I want it's okay if I have all the pasta and bread and sugar in the world because as long as I'm covering it with insulin I'm okay and then you find out wow you're taking 150 units of insulin a day in all of its forms the short acting the long acting

[00:31:17] Etc but but I didn't actually realize that that what we would consider physiologic is 35 I I may have known that at one point and I've since forgotten but that's a great reference so basically if there's a person with type 2 diabetes listening to us today and they're taking 75 units of insulin the one of the takeaways should be what do I need to do with my nutrition and other pharmacological activities plus exercise plus everything that's under my control to maybe get that down to 35 where I would be at a physiologic level absolutely there are things as you already insinuated weight loss if you can get people to do it exercise and then we can add medications uh in combination with insulin uh insulin sensitizers or some drugs to help you lose weight that will all uh also allow you to get that dose uh of uh insulin uh you know uh reduced the other thing we showed in this study Dr Del pra who's past president of the European Diabetes

[00:32:19] Association we took normal healthy lean kids 18 25 years of age and we uh gave them we put them on the clinical Research Center uh for uh 3 days and we gave them a very very low dose uh of insulin infusion and we raised their fasting insulin from eight which is what a normal person would be to 20 which is really quite low and within 48 to 72 hours they were as insulin resistant as a type 2 diabetic patient so hyperinsulinemia induces insulin resistance this is wait a second why is that the case so what insulin does is it downregulates the insulin signaling transduction system so that insulin when it binds to its receptor and then it activates irs1 and pi3 kinas and akt that system is down regulated by hyper insonia all of this that I'm telling you about it's all published these are all uh studies done in in in in humans and this also been shown in in rodent models uh as as well so this is another reason why we don't want people to be hyperinsulinemic you have to explain that to me again Ralph that is mind-boggling to me I would never I would never have predicted that so let me say it back to you because I'm I feel like I missed it when I was writing something down you took normal volunteers y who had a fasting insulin of eight yep and they're lean healthy okay and you simply infused insulin in them presumably with glucose oh yes of course on the clinical research center where we can monitor keep the glucose perfectly constant we're not letting the glucose change so person shows up insulin eight glucose is 90 you do a ug glycemic clamp where you bring insulin up only by one and a half per one and a half X much less than would be when you eat a meal exactly not even a post pral bump but now it's constitutively sitting there at 20 yeah and you've obviously had to bring glucose you had to infuse glucose to maintain ug glycemia correct did you say that in 4 days 48 to 72 hours these people are as insulin resistant as type two diabetics okay again very very counterintuitive because if our if our model is that insulin resistance which is the Hallmark Factor contributing to type 2 diabetes in the combination of beta cell fatigue is driven by lipotoxicity which we're going to come to that's an important one these people didn't have any of that no these people didn't have any of the intramyocellular lipid that we talked about with your colleague

[00:34:59] Jerry Ren as a predisposing factor it's the direct effect of insulin down regulating the insulin signaling system and probably other distal metabolic within the cell uh as well uh okay so then when you turn the clamps off SE let's just say we ran this for 72 hours we've made them functionally diabetic turn the clamps off how many hours or days do that what would you predict I would predict uh probably within 24 to 48 hours they would return to normal cuz we did this acutely now if we were able to do this for several months uh then I would anticipate that the insulin resistance would remain for a long period of time uh and remember when we treat type 1 diabetics we're always giving the insulin into the periphery uh and you or I when uh you ingest the meal where does the insulin go It Go goes into the portal vein so the liver is seeing a high level of insulin that's good it says stop making glucose but now it removes half of the insulin so how much insulin gets into the periphery half of what you secreted why because is we don't want the insulin in the periphery over

[00:36:24] insulinization insulin into the portal circulation liver sees the Insulin good stop making glucose but it also takes up half of the insulin so less insulin get enough to nourish the muscle okay enough to shut down the fat producing free fatty acids but not enough to hyper

[00:36:52] insulinization insulin it's kind of working against you because it's a reverse verting system that's making the insulin resistance aggravated so one of the big things that we've forgotten is that insulin I told you there are two problems in diabetes one is you don't make enough insulin the other is you're insulin resistant you need to attack both problems uh and the paper that I recently published which is a perspective in Lancet Diabetes

[00:37:21] Endocrinology was to bring people back to look we we're focusing on Obesity and weight loss and we should but we need to remember that we still have a genetic cause for the insulin resistance you know you go back to 1950 you know the incidence of diabetes was 2% I I've seen even data that says it was 1% as as as as as recent as 1970 it's very low y but these people were all lean and they're insulin resistant so there's a genetic cause of the insulin resistance and you think Ralph that the the greater genetic effect is on the insulin resistance side or on the beta cell fatigue side in other words both okay so let's tackle each and since you started with insulin resistance let's go there yeah um let's talk about what we know about the genetics of insulin resistance that's easy nothing truly nothing no I I I joke uh but if you uh let's say 20 years ago we got involved in one of the biggest genetic studies called the Vegas study uh veterans ad Administration genetic epidemiologic study uh and we were convinced that we would do a g we were one of the people to do the first gwa studies that we would define all the genes that are responsible well we were not very successful we even if you took the subset of people with type 2 diabetes who were lean Y and you compared them to people who were lean and non-diabetic versus obese and diabetic a GW was was not able to ident ify a signal in those three cohorts we identify several and remember their associations they're and they're in non-coding regions uh so like the tcf7 lt2 gene that uh we found that but that had already been described by Dr Michael

[00:39:14] Stern San Antonio uh many years before so we repeated what Michael showed and other people have shown that so there are a number of associations and again if you ask me how many how many genes have we truly established that are really important in terms of causing type 2 diabetes I would say very very few I know the genetics people out there probably hate this and they'll say that we can put together a genetic score but you know when they talk about a genetic score it's not that they've causely Associated a gene with di an association it's an association we have a whole different approach that will if you want I can tell you what we're doing uh that may give some uh insight and then people have started to think about rare diseases uh uh that maybe the problem is in one family you have this particular genetic mutation another family you have a different genetic mutation a third family a different genetic mutation and then when you do the gwa study you got this mixture of individual genes what about what about the phenotype Ralph so

[00:40:23] I've I've taken care of I've taken care of a couple of patients with typ diabetes who are very lean including one patient whose body fat by dexa was about 8% so for people listening that is insanely lean very lean so you take an individual whose body fat is 8% and yet they have type 2 diabetes y the first thing that comes to my mind is a lipo distrophy is this an individual who's at aost tissue is the problem in other words they're not able to assimilate enough excess nutrient I.E glucose into the fat cell and so they're undergoing the toxicity associated with an insufficient

[00:41:13] Reservoir is that what could be the the causal not that I can tell you what's causing the Lipo distrophy but is the Lipodrops that's driving the the diabetes here the answer to that is it it's very clear that lipo distrophy can cause diabetes okay this a I would say a very very rare and unusual cause but well established but that's but you're saying that's not what would explain 1% of diabetics that's two okay and Jerry shman uh has done some beautiful work in this area so it's unequivocal that lipo distopic people because their fat cells can't take up the fat it ends up in your myocardium cause heart disease ends up end up in the beta cells end your beta cell the muscle but that's a very very very small percentage uh so the the basic genetic ideology of the insulin resistance the number the par par gamma

[00:42:08] Gene has been Associated there are about seven or eight genes there's a recent study uh I think it's in nature genetics by Brown where they've identified uh eight and again they're associations except I would say the P par gamma Gene that is is pretty clear that's a c did Mitch Lazar do some of this work pardon

[00:42:29] Mitch Lazar do some of this work he's worked in this area but again the number of uh in my opinion it's a long list of folks at this point well yes the number of genes that have been described so one of the and and the other PE the other thing people said well maybe there are 20 genes involved each giving a small component and that's why it's so difficult well all of these hypotheses have been difficult to approve prove and the simple fact is we don't understand the genetic basis in part because diabetes in my opinion is a very poor phenotype diabetes is a very heterogeneous disease so when we talk about diabetes if that's your phenotype it's not surprising to me that it's going to be difficult to Define genes that are related to diabetes uh so what I'm going to tell you about I don't want to take the credit uh for this okay okay uh so one of the people in my division Dr Luke

[00:43:30] Norton uh working with Steve Parker at Michigan I'm involved cuz I'm doing the insulin clamp studies we're taking as a phenotype muscle insulin resistance this is a very very specific phenotype okay this is not diabetes the ominous octet my pathophysiology that's eight problems okay this is muscle insulin resistance

[00:43:56] I'm going to do an insulin clamp now and then I'm going to do a muscle biopsy before I do the insulin clamp and I'm going to do a muscle biopsy at the end of the insulin clamp and what happens okay well during the insulin clamp I know exactly how sensitive or resistant you are to insulin I've got the most definitive phenotype in the world no one get this kind of phenotype and now what do I see an enormous amount of Chromatin opens up this is the epigenetic component genes in uh uh chromatin areia that you're never ever going to see in the basil State and that's why we think this is a hypothesis now that why it's been so difficult uh to with all of these gwa studies to identify genes that are associated with diabetes and now we're starting to see in diabetic people in non-diabetic people we're starting to see some associations which we think now are causal and we can relate to the insulin resistance with the clamp so the first paper along these lines let's just pause there for a second Ral I want to make sure everybody's following what you're saying you're saying look one of the challenges of having a disease that isn't perfectly perfectly clearly defined where every single member of the class that has the disease looks exactly the same the word for that is heterogeneous correct um so let's take an example where the disease is very heterogeneous sickle cell anemia correct every everybody who has sickle cell anemia from a pathophysiology standpoint is identical correct and guess what there's a single mutation that defines the disease so because you have a single

[00:45:39] Gene that defines the disease one gene mutated produces one change in one base pair that changes one amino acid that changes the uh property of the hemoglobin molecule and everybody looks the same but you're saying Peter it's totally different with type 2 diabetes we have some people that are thin some people that are fat some people that have lots of insulin resistance in the muscle some people that don't seem to have much but it's all in the liver we're going to go through I want to hear

[00:46:04] I want to make sure we Define the octet the ominous octet yeah but if that's the case why would you ever expect to find a simple genetic answer definition it's going to be a mess absolutely yeah and so if you don't have a very definitive phenotype it's going to be difficult to Def the implication by the way is any physician who approaches a patient with type 2 diabetes as a single entity is going to be providing suboptimal care yes and you know I've been fighting for 20 years to convince people you need to start with combination therapy from the beginning finally 2022 the American Diabetes

[00:46:42] Association has made a comment and for the first time uh suggest that you should consider starting with combination therapy we can talk about therapy later we're going to talk about the Therapies in detail but yes it's a you have to take a Precision medicine approach to type diabetes which Begins by trying to identify which phenotype your patient is before we C I just want to make sure that everybody understands it's Luke Norton and and Steve Parker and they're the you know the brain child you know of course I'm involved I understand the disease we're doing the insulin clamps we're giving them the phenotype and they're doing single cell and it turns out like there are 10 12 different types of cells within the muscle so we we tend to think the muscle oh this a myosite that's the problem but it's probably sells also talking to each other making it even more complex so we're at an early stage in the development uh but we're we're enthusiastic we think this is I mean we really have not discovered these genes so we think that epigenetics are important and and this is part of the epigenetic phenomena we'll see where it where it takes us uh but we're pretty excited about these findings let's go back to the ominous octet make sure I have that defined and all our listeners do yeah so in 20 eight at the Banting lecture at the American Diabetes

[00:47:59] Association uh I the title of the Banting lecture was from the trium rate to the ominous octet so what was the triber I got the young investigator award the Lily award from the Ada 1987 so the trium rate was very simple the beta cell it fails insulin resistance in the muscle when you uh ingested a meal the muscle didn't take up the glucose cuz you're insulin resistant and insulin resistance in the liver when you ate a meal insulin didn't shut down uh the liver so that was the Triumph rate so from the Triumph rate to the ominous octet we needed to add five more players so who were the new five players uh so number four on the list was the fat cell uh and a very deserving guy uh so the fat cell is your friend initially you overeat you take in excess calories you store them in the fat cell that can't hurt you there but if you keep expanding those fat cells the fat cells become very very resistant to the anti- lipoic effects of insulin and now you start to pour fat out into the bloodstream we've shown this as a big interested very counterintuitive counterintuitive but very very well do do you have a do you not that we should mire ourselves in teic things do you have a sense of why yeah so the insulin signaling system in multiple early steps uh become severely impaired uh and when you get insulin resistance in the glucose metabolic pathway there are changes uh that alter the cell metabolism so you become very resistant to insulin's anti-lipolytic effect and so now if you look at people who are obese or people who have type 2 diabetes their plasma FFA levels are very very high and those FFA levels uh and this is lipotoxicity and we've got a long history of studying this High uh FFA levels impair insulin secretion uh High FFA levels cause insulin resistance in the muscle High

[00:50:07] FFA uh levels cause insulin resistance uh in the liver High FFA levels impair the insulin signaling transduction system uh and in fact one of my previous fellows who's now back with me here in ut Dr Belford was the first author on this paper showing that uh just physiologic rises in the plasma FFA literally obliterate the insulin signal transduction system which is the first step in glucose metabolism I I always thought that the reason we saw High free fatty acids in people with type 2 diabetes was not because the fat cells were undergoing more lipolysis but because the fat cells were themselves becoming resistant to insulin and not able to take up fat so it's same net effect but

[00:51:04] I was kind of drawing the arrow of causality in the other direction no the the the arrow is more in the other side the fat is pouring out fat yeah and you can show that the lipolytic enzymes are all resistant to insulin they don't uh We've shown this other people shown yeah uh so these elevated FFA levels are a disaster so the fat cell initially he's your friend he's your friend and goes to fo then it becomes bad guy okay so that's number four uh number five is the gastrointestinal tract uh and of course we'll I'm sure talk more about this when we talk about treatment but when you eat a meal you release two incretin hormones uh gp1 and Gip uh glucon like peptide one and glucose dependent insulin trophic polypeptide those two incretin hormones when you eat a meal account for about 70% of the insulin that's released in resp response to the meal so now what is the problem is the problem that you don't release enough glp1 in Gip or is it that your beta cell is refractory to the glp1 in Gip well it's the later just let's say that again Ral I want to make sure people understand this and the reason it's important is obviously everybody listening to us right now is very familiar with drugs like semaglutide and tepati but I want people to understand why those drugs were were developed and of course semaglutide is already probably what the third generation of it anyway so when we go back in time we'll understand why people try to develop these drugs but just say that again so you eat your meal yep Gip glp1 are increased and they come out normally yep that's not the problem and they're telling the beta cell hey make more insulin beta cell's deaf not listening is resistant to the glp1 and

[00:52:49] Gip and he should be responding to 70% of his input should come from that signal 70% of the insulin that's going to come out is in response depend on that glp1 and Gip so you can imagine that that's a huge problem at the level of the beta cell in terms of the defect and Insulin secretion and tell me why is it mechanistically that that the beta cell becomes deaf to glp1 and Gip I don't know that we know the answer uh to that so it's just another horrible piece of this puzzle where everything starts to work against the patient so this is an area of of course intense investig but the clinical counterpart of this is you've already mentioned the the drugs that are out there the glp1 receptor

[00:53:32] Agonist what I'm doing is I'm giving you a pharmacological dose of glp1 and I'm overcoming the resistance at the level of the beta cell now I there's another component to this that we'll get to and that's glucotoxicity so uh and these were studies that were done by Yen Holtz and the group in Denmark that they took people and they uh Infuse Gip we're talking about Gip and you don't respond to the Gip these are type 2 diabetics and then they intensively treated them with insulin and lowered their glucose and then when they come back with the

[00:54:09] Gip you re a normal amount of insulin so this is a gluco Toxic effect okay so you ask me mechanism okay so we know that at least for the Gip that glucotoxicity is impairing the ability the beta cell to response to the Gip but not necessarily glp1 no no it and and that doesn't correct the GP one problem uh so there's true resistance still even though I normalized the glucose in terms of GL uh p uh one so this incretin axis the gut is a very important endocrine organ and that's number five uh in the ominous octet number six uh in the ominous octat uh is uh the uh Alpha cell and sort of the I would say the the father of you know hypergluc gemia this is Dr Roger rer in Dallas and you know he was one of the very first people to show that diabetics had very high glucon levels and glucagon drives tell people what glucagon does yeah glucon is it drives a petag glucose production so if your glucose gets too low your alpha cells will release glucagon so the alpha cell can sense the glucose and so if you're hypoglycemic this is a important defense mechanism you release glucagon that stimulat your liver and uh and the glucose production goes up it returns your glucose uh to normal but a diabetic already has a high glucose we don't want high glucon levels so paradoxically there's very high glucon levels in uh the diabetic and those high gluton levels are very important contributor to the hepatic insulin resistance because they're driving the liver to make glucose and sorry just to make sure because I'm embarrassed to say I forget this from biochemistry is it driving the liver to make glucose out of for example glycerol amino acids orogenic pathway in glycogenolysis y but on a a more chronic acutely so if I acutely give you glucagon the first thing that happens you break down glycogen but very quickly you get rid of all the glycogen that's in the liver and so chronically now you're running on glucan Genesis but gluc gun stimulates both Pathways and does it also Drive hepatic glucose output or does it just drive the creation of glucose no no no in absolute terms it increases hepatic glucose output as well as glucogenesis yes and that's a important reason why you have fasting hypoglycemia so when you wake up in the morning yeah and your blood sugar is 110 milligrams per deci that's the liver and part of that is because your liver is intrinsically resistant to insulin part of it is because the liver is now responding to the glucagon and producing an excess amount uh of uh glucose both through glucogenesis and through glycogenolysis although I would say the major contributor is the glucogenic pathway now uh that glucogenic pathway is also turned on because fat is coming from the fat cell remember I told you the FFA is I yes cherol is coming from the fat cell so and then Jerry you know we talked about some of the work that Jerry did this is

[00:57:29] Jerry's work uh showing that glycerol coming from the fat cell is an important driver of glucan neogenesis and then uh hepatic fatty ail COA levels are up because you have all this fat pouring in and that's activating the enzymes pyrovate carboxilate that are driving the glucogenic pathway so the metabolic the GL the actual Pathways I think are very well worked out so glue gun Alpha cell bad guy okay so is the alpha cell over producing glucagon in this state yes absolutely absolutely and this is really Roger rer and Dallas's and again why is it overproducing it why is it doing something that doesn't make any sense in the context of what's happening in a certain way this is also insulin resistance because hyper insonia shuts down uh glucagon and we have very high fasting insulin levels in the diabetic okay now what is it what's the sensing mechanism within it's counterintuitive us usually when things go wrong they get attenuated right like it makes sense that the beta cell eventually fatigues because that's an attenuation of doing something that it's getting tired of doing the the the alpha cell ramping up is a little less intuitive you're going to see it gets even worse when we talk about the kidney which is number seven on the list all right let's go to number seven okay so uh people don't know I'm uh you also board certified in nefrology uh so in in in the old days I trained as a mic punctures I used to sit with a microscope I I would draw my little pipets out the night before and and I would put the little micro pipet in the tubules and I collect tubular fluid and what I was interested in uh and this is when I was a a renal fellow at

[00:59:13] University of Pennsylvania I was interested in glucose and phosphate transport and I published the series I'd say they pretty elegant papers in the jci looking at how glucose and what regulated glucose in phosphate transport and I knew that there was a molecule called Florin that blocked glucose transport uh in the kidney and so I took this molecule called Florin and it blocks the uh glucose Transporters there are two Transporters in the kidney sglt2 and sglt1 sglt2 takes back 90% of the glucose if it does its job sglt1 takes back the other 10% and then in your I even even though we filter 180 gram of glucose per day no glucose appears in the urine but what I showed is that

[01:00:03] Florin it blocked both sglt2 and sglt1 it blocked glucose transport uh and it also blocked phosphate transport and I showed that glucose and phosphate transport were cold coupled but when I was doing these studies even though I was a nephology fellow uh I had previous done my endocrine fellowship at the NIH in Baltimore City hospitals so I I had an interest in diabetes and I said this would be a great way to treat diabetes so in the old days you know we did things for science and I published a series of four papers in the jci and uh

[01:00:42] I never even thought of to be honest with you of patenting this okay and uh I have a significant other who said to me one day she said Ralph you're one of the smartest guys I ever met and I said yeah I know that and she said you know you're probably the stupidest guy I ever met I said why she said you could have patented this drug and so I actually worked uh with Bristol my squib and then uh uh astroica and that eventually led to the uh dly floen coming to the market but what we showed and this is human bio which was the first sglt2 inhibitor that's correct yes brand name on that one uh fora for right yeah and so kega floen was NE igly flows in uh yeah then canag Flows In ugly flows and we have a bunch of them and they all B they're all very good basically do the same thing but what we showed was the sglt2 transporter was marketly upregulated in the kidney okay and uh the original studies that we did hang on let's just let's just wrap our heads around that this again this is so counterintuitive I know okay this does not make any sense so you take a let's I I want to just bring it back to people listening so they understand what we're talking about here the kidney is this massive filtration another remarkable organ not no offense to the nephologist not as remarkable as the liver but every bit is remarkable in terms of I think it's more remarkable than the than the liver guy so that's okay all right all right so so so everything that's floating through our plasma is you know our our our kidneys by the way repres what they take 25% of our cardiac output hug yeah so it's massive this organ weighs 2% of our weight and takes 25% of our cardiac output why because we have to take everything that is in our circulation and dump it out and then the kidney has to selectively bring back in what's normal this was explained to me I still remember in medical school as kind of a brilliant trick of evolution Evolution was never going to be able to predict every toxic thing we might encounter and therefore teaching the kidney how to spot toxic things and get rid of them would have been a failed Mission rather it was better to teach the kidney what was absolutely necessary and to discard all other things so pretty simple way yep so it's the take everything out of your drawer and dump it out and only bring back the socks and underwear that you need so glucose pottassium sodium you name it chloride phosphate all of these things get dumped along with everything else and then it knows I need this much glucose I need this much sodium I need this much potassium so so GT2 does the lion share of this yeah it takes back 90% uh of the glucose and now so here's a diabetic with a very high glucose right so my point was sglt2 if it had a brain would say oh you have too much glucose turn turn it off how about we just stop reabsorbing all this glucose but you said it's the opposite I told you earlier it's going to get worse it ramps up sglt2 so as a doctor I want the kidney to dump the glucose out in the urine yeah but what is the kidney doing it's doing the opposite it's holding on to the glucose and so even as the renal fellow it became clear to me this is such a simple way to treat diabetes and the fact is it's so simple no one thought about it okay the only dumb thing that I did was I didn't patent it which I should have done I'd probably never have to write another NIH grant for the rest of my life uh and then uh we went on to show and in fact this is the first definitive proof of the GL gluco toxicity hypothesis so we did all of these studies initially in animals uh and this was all published in the jci uh and luchiano Rosetti is is one of the fellows at this time actually Jerry

[01:04:40] Schulman was a fellow on the papers as well uh and what what we showed uh was uh that uh you could take different types of diabetic animal models uh and you could show that they're reabsorbing excessive amounts of glucose and then if I treated them with Florin because that's what was available they simply peed the glucose out in the urine and now all of a sudden their beta cells started functioning normally the muscle insulin sensitivity improved so of course that's wonderful if you're a mouse or a rat so we said well what about humans and so uh the original studies actually were done and there's kind of an interesting story behind this but the initial studies were done with dagly loin and we showed with just 14 days of treatment with dagly loin we markedly lowered the fasting in postprandial glucose we improved insulin sensitivity by 35% and we made a major

[01:05:40] Improvement in beta cell function now the beauty of this sglt2 Inhibitors are only in the kidney they're not in your muscle they're not in your beta cell and the only thing that the sglt2 Inhibitors do makes you put glucose out in the urine the only change in the plasma was the glucose came down and now insulin sensitivity improved in muscle in beta cell function improved and this was the first now in humans even though the original studies were done in animals first studies to show an improvement in uh uh the reality of glucotoxicity what was interesting is that when we started to work on developing this with BMS and astroica uh the company decided well we should get some nephologist in to see about this story and they they said look if you listen to what Dr defano says this will be a disaster and they said why because if you put glucose in the urine uh it will glycosilated the proteins then you'll cause kidney damage and they actually held up the development of the sglt2 Inhibitors H and the way we finally convinced them to go ahead was that there's a disease called familial renal glucosuria they from day one of their life to they're bringing out tremendous amounts of glucose they have perfectly normal kidney function how many grams of glucose can be differentially or you know extra secreted basically in the presence of an sglt2 inhibitor today upwards uh it it it kind of depends on what the level of your GFR is but it could be anywhere from 40 to 60 gr up to 120 gram of glucose uh so there's and and the higher would be in somebody that with a higher gradient yeah the higher the glucose the higher the yes cuz you filter more glucose then there's more glucose to be uh blocked at the level of the kidney and these drugs are very very good now I I actually in in developing these drugs as I said I'm also a neologist based on the Barry brener hypothesis I predicted these drugs would save your kidneys uh according to the B brener hypothesis and that's all turned out to be correct these drugs are great for the kidney what I never ever envisioned that these drugs were going to save your heart that was like that came I mean so I I want to come back to that because I'm making notes of other things I want to come back to and and so I want to come back to just so you can hear me say it now and we remember I want to come back to combined Inhibitors the sglt2 sgt1 inhibitor there's a sing I think there's a new drug that now sod glyos yeah that it does both we'll just touch on that and then I want to also come back to the broader geroprotective nature of the sglt 2s as documented by the ITP in mice and then also in the human studies for for cardio protection but let's before we do that let's we need to finish the exactly let's go back to number eight the brain okay okay so the brain plays a role in a somewhat indirect way so every day you know you have your breakfast your lunch I actually eat only once a day but at some point you eat a meal and at sometime during the meal you'll say okay I'm hungry I stop eating why' you ever think why does that happen well because there are certain hormones that are released or inhibited that tell you okay you're satiated stop eating well one of the very important ones is glp1 uh that same thing that's increasing insulin secretion your brain has become very resistant to glp1 when you eat a meal Amin comes out it comes out in a 1:1 ratio with insulin your brain has become resistant to amlin your brain is resistant to leptin so there are a lot of these interc molecules uh that uh your brain has become resistant to and uh these uh molecules and it's another area of interest of mine these they work in the hedonic areas in the brain so in the putam in the prefrontal cortex and they tell you to stop eating uh and unfortunately there's uh and this is the big unknown is what's going on in the brain the neurocircuitry is clearly distorted not only is the neuros circuitry distorted one of the big things that we are interested in Dr

[01:10:00] Peter Fox and myself at at UT is if you look at the gray matter in these areas in the areas that are critically important in regulating your appetite there's shrinkage of the gray matter area okay and in these areas if you do an insulin clamp okay the brain is insensitive to insulin in youru ey in obese people these areas in the brain with this abnormal mark increase in glucose uptake incredible finding who would have thought I'm sorry you're saying that these are the few areas in my brain and your brain that are actually default insulin insensitive yes don't take up glucose correct if I Ain do an insulin clamp so what is their fuel source lactate uh well they're saturated I'm sorry that in response to insulin they don't take up more glucose oh oh okay I'm sorry got it cuz remember as long remember this is from The Kill studies as long as your glucose is about 50 uh your brain is happy so this is actually in in the evolution of the human being this is phenomenal because in the old days you may not eat for you you may Slaughter one of these beasts that yeah you're not eating for days you're not eating for days so your glucose would drop so if your normal fasting was 80 uh if it dropped to 40 you were okay because your brain saturated at 40 if you got below 40 you're in trouble uh so uh you have a a big sort of buffer uh here but now if I

[01:11:29] Infuse insulin in your glucose as 80 your brain doesn't taken up more uh glucose it's quote insulin insensitive in a certain uh way uh now of course if you take people with mild cognitive impairment we we there's been some experiments that actually suggest in these people insulin infusion can transiently improve glucose uptake but presumably that's because they're insufficiently getting glucose in the disease State yes this has been postulated yeah and this also suggested that there's brain insulin resistance yeah uh which is I I'd say an interesting concept uh and may play some role in this neurocognitive dysfunction Alzheimer's whole kind of different story that's sort of in uh Evolution but to come back to the ominous octet now if you overeat what happens you gain weight and when you gain weight you become insulin resistant severely insulin resistant that's lipotoxicity okay uh and we've done uh studies in both directions I can uh put an IV and I can

[01:12:34] Infuse uh uh an Emulsion of free fatty acids and I can show within 20 within 4 hours two to four hours I induced severe insulin resistance uh in uh the muscle uh uh in in in in the liver and I marketly impaired betol uh function and then U we don't have this drug in the United States uh but there's a drug that's available in Europe and I have an indd to use it it's called The cpox it inhibits lipolysis it's like sglt2 inhibitor the only thing to do is block glucose reabsorption in the kidney cpox all it does is do block lipolysis it lowers your FFA level and we've done this uh we've done does it result in any meaningful clinical increase in osity or is it so subtle that you don't notice it over 12 days no change in adap capity huge Improvement in insulin sensitivity and muscle uh you can show all of these major bi why is it not approved in the

[01:13:32] US uh it it it it it was uh I don't know that the company that developed it in Europe ever tried to get it approved in the US it's I would say modestly effective in lowering triglycerides and we have pheno fibrates which are much more effective so that may be the reason although this drug been around but the triglyceride and the

[01:13:56] FFA are not the same thing no uh but that's the reason why it's approved in Europe uh but uh if you lower the FFA that's the precursor for triglyceride synthesis so it it has an effect to lower the triglycerides but the key thing is if you lower the FFA and we did this for 12 days we did in both obese people and in diabetic you markedly improve insulin sensitivity in the muscle if using MRI you can measure muscle fat goes down dramatic ially and and correlates with the Improvement in insulin sensitivity uh we also measured

[01:14:31] ATP generation because there's this uh issue is this clearly mitochondrial dysfunction if you're a diabetic that that's unequivocal the controversy is is the mitochondrial dysfunction causing the insulin resistance or is the insulin resistance causing the mitochondrial dysfunction so in this study uh that we did when we lowered the FFA uh and lowered the muscle uh lipid uh content we saw uh about a 50%

[01:15:02] Improvement in ATP generation mitochondrial ATP generation so at least this says that part of the mitochondrial dysfunction is secondary to the lipotoxicity and insulin resistance uh but this Still Remains I I would say a controversial topic clearly this mitochondrial dysfunction if you can improve it that's going to improve insulin sensitivity is there anything that improves mitochondrial function more than aerobic exercise training pitzone the drug how so I can't get people to use which is a phenomenal it uh by activating P power gamma uh it it does a lot of good things and one of the important things that it does it has a huge effect to improve mitochondrial uh dysfunction uh and it has Direct effects it also works on the it works directly through P par gamma to do this and it also binds directly to the mitochondrial pyro carrier uh and that uh influences uh flux through the uh through the you know the the mitochondrial uh chain and why don't people use this drug today uh huge misconceptions uh so we'll

[01:16:19] I guess we'll talk about therapy uh we'll come back to it okay we'll park it until we come back to part of my triple therapy regimen uh I use a glp1 receptor Agonist uh I use pitzone and I use an sglt2 inhibitor that there's a fourth good drug and that's metformin uh and you might ask well why is metformin number four on my list of good drugs since I single-handedly brought metformin to the United States in 1995 no other endocrinologist involved in this 1995 Med foran was a revolutionary drug why we had insulin cellone uras okay so now we had a drug that really could work okay uh and uh it's still a very good drug and of course it's very cheap it's $5 a month in the state of Texas but we have much better drugs pitone causes weight gain okay now here's the problem and it'll become very obvious you know we we talk about these paradoxes the more weight gain the the greater the drop in A1c the more weight gain the greater the Improvement in insulin sensitivity and is it fat gain specifically no oh I'll I'll come back to that in a second okay uh it is fat weight gain and I also believe muscle weight gain okay uh uh the more weight gain the greater the Improvement in beta cell function the more weight gain the greater the drop in blood pressure the more weight you gain the greater the drop in triglycerides the more weight you gain the rise in Greater the rise in

[01:17:51] HDL cholesterol sounds like terrible drug right so here's another one of those paradoxes okay so why would weight get we know if you overeat and gain weight that's a disaster but with pitzone the more weight you gain everything gets better what pitzone does is it shifts weight around in the body in my opinion it's the best drug for treating Nash no drug is going to beat puso okay uh and the pharmaceutical companies they don't if you had to go up against pitzone all these Nash drugs I don't believe you can beat pisone what's the brand name for pism ose okay uh so uh the the the as I said there's this now Paradox uh so why do you game weight H pitone it it redistributes fat in the body it gets it out of the mudle puts it muscle puts it in subcutaneous tissue gets it out of the liver puts it in subcutaneous tissue gets it out of your beta cells put it in sub anous tissue that's not going to make you gain weight the richest density of par gamma receptors in the hypothalamus so when I activate these P par gamma receptors in the hypothalamus you eat okay it makes you hungry that's got nothing to do with redistributing the fat in the body except they parallel each other in association and so you see the weight gain and people say oh that's bad but what's really doing the thing is this recycling okay uh and moving the fat around the other negative thing about pitzone is it causes fluid retention okay so people have Associated fluid retention with heart filler now uh why do you get fluid retention again this is people do not understand uh pitzone the only thing the only drug that is a true insulin sensitizer is pitone metformin is not a true insulin sensitizer that total misconception pitone that insulin signaling defect that uh I told you about pitzone corrects that defect it's incredible so so we we did we kind of glossed over this Ralph because we were going to spare people the details but it's probably worth just reminding people yeah insulin binds to the insulin receptor that's outside the cell yeah is that a that's a that's a that's a kinas receptor correct they're three tyrosine molecules Y and they have to be phosphorated and if you these are studies done Ron Khan and other people in Boston you mutate one of those tyrosines you become a little insulin resistant you mutate two of them you become moderately insulin resistant you meate three of them you're severely insulin resistant insulin binds to the receptor yep okay that happens normally in diabetics we showed that that there's no problem there then irs1 insulin receptor substrate one moves in which is inside the cell comes up yes yep and it it interacts with with uh the insulin receptor and it gets phosphorated on the same three tyrosine molecules and then you activate pi3 cyas akt as10 we could add some more molecules in here but uh this is the inant signaling pathway that's the pathway that the earliest defect that you can show in diabetics is in that pathway okay and if I recall didn't isn't this where Jerry argued that the intramyocellular lipid was creating the defect in that pathway the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid so what Jerry has shown very elegantly okay is that there are certain lipids uh deat is uh that's right is uh and it's a specific

[01:21:39] Decat they're like several types of Decat molecules which has confused things so he's shown this is specific one of the dgats that uh activates these eight atypical pkc uh uh uh molecules and that sering phosphates the insulin receptor when you serin phosphorate the molecules in that pathway it inactivates them okay and so he's done these very nice elegant studies both in peripheral muscle and in the liver showing that this plays a very very important role in the insulin resistance this is part of the Lipo toxicity I I don't believe that this is the genetic basis the genetic ideology this is when you you get fat and you start putting fat everywhere this is very important uh critically important and and that was when he gave his

[01:22:27] Banting lecture and I might say I I'm delighted that I got to write his I his letter of nomination for the Banting lecture he was incredibly deserving he's done phenomenal work in this area uh but that was his bany lecture and you're right very very very important mechanism of insulin resistance and so given that that's both a very important and very common pathway towards insulin resistance bringing it back to par gamma par gamma is part of the pathway it's part of the irs1 P gamma pi3k glute for bring the glucose in the cell in other words if people don't want to get mired down in this which is totally understandable insulin hits a receptor that receptor kicks off a

[01:23:16] Cascade that ultimately results in a little tube being like a little straw that goes into the cell surface that allows glucose to freely flow in against its in in its gradient but remember that same pathway also activates nitric oxide synthes that's right generates nitric oxide and that's why we see in patients with insulin resistance even if glucose is controlled cardiovascular disease is still up a very important yeah very important Point um so back to ose yeah so so so now what does it do uh it activates that siging pathway you generate nitric oxide now you vasod dilate that's why the blood pressure drops when you vasod dilate so I'm a nephologist I understand this very clearly anytime you under peruse the kidney you hold on a salt and morar you become a ademus okay uh and uh so people uh associate fluid retention in edema with heart failure so we did the definitive study it's published in

[01:24:23] Diabetes Care in 20 17 people just don't read okay so we took people who had diabetes uh and we treated them with pitone and then using NMR very very sophisticated techniques what we showed is pitzone markedly improved Mar cardial blood flow now these numbers are going to blow your mind away Mar cardial insulin sensitivity with pet and fluid deoxy glucose improved by 75% your heart we showed this before is severely insulin resistant I came pretty damn close to normalizing insulin sity in your heart now since we're doing the insulin clamp with Trad glucose you can track it 74% Improvement in skeletal muscle insulin Sensi exactly the same if you look at ejection fraction it went up by 5 to 10% not down it went up if you look at every measure of diastolic dysfunction e over a e over e Prime LV

[01:25:24] Peak filling pressures Etc Cardiology people understand this the point is whether you're looking at systolic function or diastolic function it all got better so it's a it's a victim of maybe not so nuanced thinking about the drug yeah now the critic would push back and say okay Ralph but don't we have better drugs like I mean no drug that that corrects insulin resistance that foran is not an insulin sensitizer and people keep going back to this so I

[01:25:53] I brought met form to the US in 1995 I know this I did all the mechanism of action studies and what we showed was the insulin clamp the drug absolutely does not improve insulin sensitivity so let's talk about metformin everybody wants to know if metformin is geroprotective but let's just remind people um we so so metformin inhibits complex one of the mitochondria is that of the electron transport chain is that a given uh yes uh in I I'd say this is still controversial okay in high doses for sure yes and the kind of doses you see with giving metformin I would say somewhat equivocal in my opinion so is it is the belief that metformin's efficacy in diabetes is through reducing hepatic glucose output that is 100% true okay and what's the mechanism by which it reduces hepatic glucose output inhibiting the mitochondrial chain in inhibiting glucano Genesis well for sure it inhibits glucano Genesis okay okay uh now uh metformin gets into cells through the organic cation transporter the organic cat iron transporter doesn't exist in muscle it can't possibly be an insulin sensitizer in muscle you're asking the drug to do something that's impossible and if you give labeled metformin does it get into muscle mitochondria no it doesn't get into muscle at all why does lactate go up when people are taking metformin level of the liver it's in interfering uh with aerobic metabolism and so there's a block and this is very important I have erroneously always believed that so I'm really happy to be corrected I love being proved wrong I have always believed that the reason we saw an increase in fasting lactate even in healthy people if they took metformin was because of the inhibition of the ECT in skeletal muscle and you're saying not possible it can't get into skeletal muscle as absolutely not a single molecule in the world of metform has ever gotten into any skeletal muscle anywhere and tell me again why what's the transporter the organic cation transporter that's the transporter that uh by which metformin enter cells it does not exist in skeletal muscle it does not exist in cardiac muscle so metformin cannot get into these tissues it's a huge major misconception it can if if you have very very high doses that can occur when you have very low GFR uh because metformin is excreted via the kidney if the metformin levels build up you can get lacast does that's a very very rare complication this there's not a reason why you shouldn't be using the metformin and and I'm not saying that metformin is not a good drug it is a good drug I don't think it's as good as the other three drugs we talked about uh but yes it does at high doses increase the lactate level all in effect on the liver and the old drug that caused all the problem was Fen Forin I bu guide as well but it had a powerful effect yeah

[01:29:10] Fen Forin was much more powerful yes and that's why people were afraid to uh bring metformin to the US and when you say high dose I mean is two grams a day of Metformin that's the normal dose that's the normal dose okay so Matt foran has the following going for it it's free very Che yes it's basically free yeah it's free absolutely and it does a pretty good job at reducing hepatic glucose output Y and it has no myotoxicity frankly any toxicity GI yeah the GI but you can usually overcome that with a slow ramp up yeah and see this is the reason why some people thought it's an insulin sensitizer 15 to 20% of people have significant GI side effects and they lose weight and if you look at the studies on average there's about a 3 kilogram weight loss with medform and when you lose weight you can improve insulin sensitivity so I think this is what's confused some of the old literature to make people think that metformin was an insulin sensitizer but when we developed metformin uh and I did all of the work that went to the FDA if if you look at the New England Journal medicine Article 19 see uh 95 there only two names on the paper myself and a PhD oncology lady who was the person from uh

[01:30:33] Leaf of pharmaceuticals uh we did insulin clamps many of them we never could show me for and improve insulin sensitivity using the gold standard with radio isotopes do you do you think many people I feel like I'm asking you this question a lot and it's getting a little old but do you do you get the sense that most people are still thinking what I think which is that metformin gets into the muscle metformin is an insulin sensitizer absolutely and it's an insulin sensitizer by getting into the muscle and inhibiting complex one absolutely people have done pet studies so you can label metformin and you give it okay and then where do you see it's all accumulating in the liver okay in the first 3 four 5 10 minutes and then what happens you start to see it uh accumulating in the kidney okay why cuz that's where it's excreted and then wait another 5 or 10 minutes you see bladder okay and that's the only place where you see metformin you never see it in the muscle okay and that's even more graphic demonstration you know uh that metformin is not getting into muscle and it is definitely not an insulin sensitizer is there a downside to using Metformin in combination with the other three drugs of which we no NOP the classic study which we'll talk about which to me should change the entire approach to treating diabetes it's called the EDI study and in the edict study what we did is we used triple therapy right from the beginning and my my my point of the

[01:32:02] Banting lecture the ominous octet if you have eight problems and there I'm sure going to be more to be found and I can give you a few more if you want but if you have eight problems why in the world you think one drug is going to correct eight problems it ain't going to happen in our lifetime so the point was you need to use drugs in combination so we said we're going to use what and we uh what we think are the best drugs at the time so we started with metformin with xenti an oldtime gp1 this is not the

[01:32:34] Kingpin this is the pre- glutide yeah exactly because that's what was available that drug was useless wasn't it no it's a good drug sure it's not semaglutide but you have to start somewhere yeah let's let's pay it its dues as being the Gen one OG version of that drug without which we might not have we wouldn't have sulti toti yes so it's kind of an Oldtimer in pitone that was the triple therapy okay uh and then we said every diabetic patient there 315 people in this study they're having insulin clamps hypoglycemic clamps muscle Vibes no one in the world can do this study 315 people follow for six years okay so we said this is what we believe is the appropriate therapy and then we said we'll use the Ada approach the Ada approach is you start a metformin okay and when you fail even though explicitly said the next drug that's used is self allas and then the third drug that's added is insulin and we said uh that the goal of therapy was an A1C of 6 and A2 okay uh and that if your A1C uh Rose above 6 and

[01:33:48] A2 uh either on our triple therapy or on the step wise treat to fail approach that the Ada says Ada says start metform and you fail you add suol youra you fail you add insulin you titrate the insulin basil insulin up to 60 units and we said 60 units is really well we'll cap it because yeah you're already at 2x physiologic Y and now now you have to now split the dose of insulin you have to be adding rapid acting insulin I I think this is quite reasonable 6 years later okay 29% of the the people with the Ada approach have failed their A1C is above 6 and a half 6 years later with our approach 70% of the people have an A1C that's less than 6 and a half why insulin clamp huge improvement with our therapy okay this is the eating study the the three-year data published the six-year data we're writing it up how much improvement in insulin sensitivity with the Ada approach zero beta cell function you have almost a normal beta cell Ralph why disconnect between where between between what you're seeing in the EDI study and what the Ada is promoting uh you have to ask the Ada what's their answer if if

[01:35:05] I'm a patient and I'm and or if I'm a physician who's treating these patients and I'm saying guys I'm confused I'm looking at the literature I'm seeing this I'm looking at your and by the way I see this with the AHA and cardiovascular guidance so I'm not singling out you or or but but like is this simply a question of the pace at

[01:35:23] Which medicine moves is so glacial that's part of it plus remember if to do 315 people follow them for 16 years and do all the stuff we did it's unequivocal and why has there not been political pressure because the cost of insulin is enormous and your approach is going to be less expensive they finally said in 2022 there's a statement the the Ada approach is not based on pathophysiology

[01:35:50] I I I view myself as a scientist okay as well as a clinician as a good clinician I taken care of hundreds of thousands of patients and I've done 850 Publications uh I do clinical research I work on people when I do an insulin clamp study and I see an improvement in insulin sensitivity I do a hypoglycemic clamp and I see in 315 people your b s function I don't need 5,000 people I don't need I can't do this study in 5,000 people no one can do this study but the the the tools that we're using are so powerful look if I normalize your insulin sensitivity and I give you a normal beta cell and your A1C is less than 6 and a half and it's well it's half of the half of the 315 people why you not think that's the best therapy okay and now on the other side I have this metformin Su insulin and that 71% of the people have failed there's zero

[01:36:48] Improvement in insulin sensitivity zero Improvement in beta cell function why you think that's such a good regiment and now above and beyond all that I didn't do this study this is the great study g r a de it's sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and what the great study said is uh and I have to say this is the third study that's shown what I'm going to tell you Dr Robert

[01:37:13] Turner's United Kingdom prospective diabetes stud showed this uh in uh year 1990 uh Steven Kar showed this in the adopt study in year 2005 and now we have the great study 2020 I call this the 15-year Revolution revelation we saw what didn't work 1990 oh stepen Khan did it again oh it didn't work in 2005 and now 2020 NIH did it you know what I'll show the same thing and this was a sequential approach you had to have fail on met foran to get into the study okay so you failed in met foran then you enter the study then we go single agent I can they they want to know what's the best next drug to add to metformin I can add a

[01:37:58] Sone Ura A1C went down in year one up straight I can add tell folks how a Sone Ura works yeah Sone uas uh are oldtime drugs they bind to the cellone UA receptor on the beta cell and they kick out insulin and they're very good drugs in the first year and then they burn out the pancreas well they stop working yeah

[01:38:19] I mean basically they they kick the can down the road without addressing the pathophysiology that I like that way yes then other drug dpp4 inhibitor tell people how those work yeah so a dpp4 inhibitor increases your glp1 and your Gip level uh endogenously it makes your gastrointestinal cells the K and the L cells that secrete the glp1 and Gip makes them make more gp1 and Gip but it it doesn't increase the glp1 and Gip enough to really give you a knockout punch I give you an injection you all people are out there of Monaro or semaglutide that's the knockout punch okay when I give you the dpp4 Inhibitors

[01:39:02] H they yeah they they do increase glp1 and Gip a little bit but not powerful enough to give you a long lasting effect so first year A1C comes down A1C goes up uh third drug that this was very surprising to me this was liraglutide this is one of the earlier glp1 receptor yeah I thought that was going to work the best it failed it worked in the first year and then failed and then the fourth drug was insulin and the the docks just didn't tirate the insulin enough so A1 see you down and then they failed so five years later all four of those regimens added to metformin failed triple therapy exenatide an oldtime glp1

[01:39:47] P lone which people don't appreciate the only true insulin sensitizer and met foran 6 years later you're 7% of the people have an A1C less than 7 and and and let's just go back metformin is free the Gen one uh exti ex basically free is basically free now pitone is $5 a month okay so we have three free drugs that work better correct now it's interesting when you talk about today's triple therapy which is way more efficacious two of those three drugs are very expensive yes the S to2 Inhibitors are very expensive and the modern day gen 3 gen Gen 4 and soon we'll have a Gen 5 gop1 they're very pricey they're very $1,000 a month for the yeah now are they great drugs so the question is yeah is but but I guess the question is do they do you need to be on those drugs if your old version of triple therapy our old version is incredibly effective the problem is you can't get people to use pitone and the reason is the patients are frustrated with the fact that they're retaining water no more that they they gain weight how much weight do they gain typically how many kilos depends on the dose I like I don't go to the 45 mgram dose so at the end of the year they may gain two or two and a half kilos at the 15 and 30 milligram uh dose okay but their A1C is controlled so you have to explain to people here's another incredible thing uh so there was a a cardiovascular This truly incredible by the way I'm sorry to interrupt you again um if you give po plus a modernday glp1 offset the weight you cannot believe oh you lose all the weight you go lose with the gp1 receptor so if a patient is willing to go down the path of a modern-day glp1 doesn't that completely eliminate absolutely and it also gets rid of the edema yeah and believe me their a1c's are down in the normal range you know I I if you took my hands so uh let let me tell you this first thing about pitone and the proactive I'll come back and we'll answer this so in in the proactive study uh This was done long time ago you have to show cardiovascular safety 5,238 people to get in the study you had to have an MI stroke or something bad uh half people on pitone half the people on

[01:42:07] Placebo okay and uh the mace endpoint major adverse cardiovascular events which is non-fatal MI non-fatal stroke cardiovascular mortality you have to show the benefit to get approval by the FDA the the mace endpoint was POS okay uh and so uh when I talk to cardiologists I like to say what was the one thing uh in the pitzone that predicted that you would not die they don't know you know what the one thing that predicted that you wouldn't die weight gain

[01:42:44] H so I jokingly say look you can either be a little fat and alive or you can be lean and dead which one you going to pick I think I go for being a little bit chubby so again but now we that's not even a necessary comparison you don't even need to make that tradeoff with a modern day glp1 Agonist and we've done this and we've published this uh if you tied my hands behind my back and said

[01:43:11] Ralph you can only pick one drug I would pick one of the newer glp ones they're incredible drugs now but but that's not what I'm going to do even for a lean diabetic uh a little bit different story but the answer is basically yes okay but let let me okay narrow that down a little bit uh if I had to pick two drugs I would pick pitzone with one of the newer drugs and uh for sure uh if you had any kind of renal cardiac disease I'm going to pick an estl T2 inhibitor but I would say although this study will never be done if you're a newly diagnosed diabetic and you don't have any cardiac symptoms why do you think that the sglt2 inhibitor is not doing all of the beneficial things in that newly diagnosed diabetic that it's doing and the people who get into these studies who already have cardiac disease so if you have a cardiac problem

[01:44:09] I put you on the sglt2 inhibitor you're less likely to have Mi stroke Etc it's doing good things it's doing in my opinion the exact same good thing in someone who I'm just diagnosing for the first time when I put them on the srt2 inhibitor but no one is ever going to do a study it's impossible I'm going to take a thousand people and you you have to take five you probably have to take 20,000 people newly diagnosed uh and then 10,000 go on sglt2 and 10,000 on Placebo

[01:44:40] I'm going to follow them for 20 years to see who's going to have their heart attack no one's going to do that study because they're going to get on all kinds of drugs so no one is going to be able to show but that's sort of like yeah that's never gonna happen but I also don't think it needs to happen in the same way that um I agree with you in the same way that we saw for example you know pcsk9 Inhibitors reduced mace in people with secondary prevention take people who had already suffered mace put them on a PS pcsk9 inhibitor you secondary prevention reduce subsequent well of course everybody's using these for primary prevention now that's effectively what you're saying we already know the sglt2 works for secondary prevention that may never get approved for primary prevention but it probably justifies I agree with you 100% so so just to make sure I'm synthesizing what you're saying Ralph um if you only get one drug and your price agnostic glp one

[01:45:37] Agonist yeah if you get to add a second drug you're going to add po yeah if you get a third drug especially if you care about your heart2 and what's amazing is met foran didn't even make the top three in your list but it's never for so here's my question given that metformin is free yeah should we just be adding it the second we put on the glp1 I don't have any problem with that Y and also we have to be cognizant of the fact you know these newer gp1s they we're talking yeah but they're $1,000 a month yeah so you know I want to ask you about that so so the just again for the listeners right the semaglutide Gen 3 uh tepati is Gen 4 redit trde is coming out assuming the phase three goes according to plan yeah and Ki SEMA is the new Nova one yeah so here let's go back to rat true tride yeah gp1 yeah Gip and glucagon glucagon can you explain that in the context of the octet where glucagon is going up yeah uh I can I think okay but it's not proven okay uh so uh remember I told you that insulin knocks down glucagon so if I give you it a a glp1 receptor Agonist and I kick out insulin and I get you well

[01:47:03] insulinization okay so that glucagon effect to drive AA glucose production will be totally blunted by the insulin secretory effect and see this the other thing that bothers me about these gp1s These are the best drugs in the world for losing weight these are the best drugs in the world for saving your pile people I told you that when you when you eat a meal 70% of the insulin that's secreted is coming from the glp1 and the Gip people have stopped talking about this effect on the beta cell this

[01:47:36] I told you if you want to look at type two diabetes big problems beta cell failure insulin resistance these gp1s they're saving your beta cell I mean we've forgotten about we've come so enamored with the weight loss and I I don't want to downplay that at all because the weight loss and the lipotoxicity a huge problem that's causing the the insulin resistance but people have forgotten how powerful the drugs are on the beta cell so when I give you this drug and they work on the beta cell and kick out insulin any negative thing that glue gon's doing will be totally negated now you may see some good things that glucan are doing that we couldn't appreciate before so what are the good things some people have suggested that increases thermogen energy expenditure I don't believe that there are animal data I don't believe this in humans I believe that it's exerting an anorectic effect in the central nervous system that is I think yet to be established

[01:48:34] I'm pretty sure there are studies going on now at the Pennington Institute and maybe also in Orlando uh where they have these Chambers where you can TR yeah yeah so uh I think we'll get an answer about you know energy expenditure I yeah I would be surprised if they're going to see a CL clinically meaningful increase in in non involuntary energy expenditure

[01:48:58] I'm with you I think it's all appetite and and here's another issue okay so it is very interesting if you look at all these big glp1 studies cardiovascular what's the reduction in cardiovascular events almost uniformly 20% old dudes exenatide Etc log glutide new dudes 20% even though the weight loss with the newer ones is much greater much greater I I suspect in terms of cardiovascular benefit there is a cap uh that once you've lost a certain amount of weight and you gotten a certain amount of lipotoxicity and all the good things that these drugs are doing you don't go beyond that even though you're losing more weight and also if you look at the A1C you know yes monjaro does drop the A1c a little bit more than semaglutide but they're both pretty powerful roude does a little bit more and does car Kisa do a little bit more but they don't do a lot more so I also think there's also going to be a somewhat of a cap on how much you drop the A1C you know you get two and a half% drop can you drop at three uh do you need to drop at three so you're saying if a person shows up with um hog glob A1C of 95% y this is a person who hasn't come to medical attention soon enough and I'm going to give you the answer definitively but I'm going let you ask the question you're happy if they only go from 9 and a half% to 7% if they only had a 2 and a half% drop you wouldn't try to get them down to 6% I would and we've done the study okay okay oldtime guys all right so this called the Qatar study so there's this uh concept that's out there and again people don't what's always amazing to me see what drives me is science if you understand pathophysiology and there's an abnormality and you correct the abnormality things get better okay so in the Qatar study uh and there are 220 people or so in the study to get into the Qatar study you had to be poorly controlled on medform and celling Rhea so you had to have failed on this and the average A1C was about 10 uh and uh about a third of these people were symptomatic meaning they had polyurea polydipsia they were losing weight and so the the current concept is in those people you would put them on a mixs spit insulin regimen you would get rid of the glucotoxicity you get rid of the lipotoxicity and uh you get their A1C down to 6 and A2 and then now you could put them back on the oral medications or whatever and now they respond cuz you got rid of the glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity we said well that may or may not be true so we said well half of these people are starting with an a above 10 uh will go on uh a mixs spit insulin regimen okay with a garene and a rapid acting insulin and the other half are going to go on that old dude exenatide and peone the one one that people don't like to use okay three years later the A1C in the group with the mix split insulin regimen is 7.1% uh and we very good at insulin why couldn't we go lower because we got into trouble with hypoglycemia okay the A1C in the group treated with exenatide and pitzone is 6.1 and so then we said okay look uh we'll we'll look we'll do a subgroup analysis and so about onethird of the people were we we'll just look at the people who are symptomatic the starting

[01:52:48] A1C is 12.2 3 years later they're a is 6.1 how long 6.1 3 years later 12 yeah 12.2 symptomatic on which combination exenatide and pitone without even metformin without they had failed on met for issue to get into the study okay so what we're saying look if you have drugs that correct the insulin resistance that's po Glo again Ralph this is almost impossible for me to imagine I can send you all the papers it's all published but I just you know I just I hope every single family medicine internist everyone who ever takes care of somebody with diabetes is listening I hope so too because you're basically saying we can take these two old cheap drugs and take someone from the most brittle type 2 diabetes I mean a hemoglobin A1c of 12 you're knocking on death's door correct you're going to go blind you're going to have your toes amputated you're not ever going to have an erection again and you're going to die of cardiovascular disease or kidney disease or Alzheimer's disease quickly these numbers that I'm telling you they're right from the paper and it's a

[01:54:04] Lars over 200 people and in a couple of years on two old cheap drugs you're normal yep and what's better what makes these studies so solid is we have very sophisticated pathophysiologic measurements no one can do what we do so so the push back is those patients are going to have to gain a couple of kilograms of but but of course if if you're willing to now spend a bit more money and switch them from gen one to gen 3 or Gen 4 gp1 Agonist and Gip then all of a sudden you ameliorate that and you get all the benefits th this becomes a nonissue put cost aside in fact if you

[01:54:43] I would wonder if you add met foran you almost cancel out the weight gain a little bit because you might get a little bit of the GI Improvement and you get the two to three of weight loss there minus these drugs are so powerful when you put them with pitzone you don't get the I mean you lose almost the same amount of weight they they're huge in terms of getting you to lose lose weight

[01:55:05] I mean so which which was that study uh this is called the Qatar it was done in in Qatar QA oh like Qatar the country the country so uh and I need to give credit to Dr bahmad abug gani who's been sort of you know my my coworker in all of these uh studies and mohammad's on the faculty at UT in our diabetes uh division can we at least assume that the

[01:55:30] Gulf States are paying attention to this a the study was done in Qatar B the Gulf States are disproportionately ravaged by type 2 diabetes yep is it is it at least being heated there they are and I can tell you we have a big program uh that's going on there as well as in Kuwait uh and we actually have a formal uh

[01:55:50] Cooperative agreement with the qu people people uh so at the dmin Diabetes Institute uh uh we have uh trained them my people have been there trained them how to do these insulin clamps and you know sophisticated metabolic studies and they take care of the patients and we're comparing the gene so here's another thing that's pretty exciting that we're doing so uh and again it's looking for genes that cause diabetes so you eat a meal okay you eat a meal your gluc ose goes up that secretes insulin uh there's amino acids in the meal that secretes insulin and gp1 goes up and that secretes insulin so now when you eat a meal there are already three stimuli and now you're looking for a gene or a set of genes that might be associated with beta cell failure when you have three stimuli now that's going to be pretty confusing so what we said what maybe what we should do is that we should do a three-step hypoglycemic clamp uh so we give you three steps of uh glucose and we can get beta cell sensitivity to glucose from the slope I give you a little rise in glucose another rise in glucose another rise in glucose I see how much C peptide comes up the slope of that curve is that's beta cell sensitivity to glucose and then the M value is where it hits the axis then I can get glucose but this is just now I'm going to focus on the beta okay because the hypoglycemic clamp is just for beta cell function okay and then after that now I'm going to give you gp1 infusion and I'm going to see how much insulin comes out and then after that I'm going to give you an balanced amino acid infusion I'm going to see how much insulin comes out so you can sequentially measure the different three different stimuli and now what we see is different loide some are associated with the defect in glucose some are associated with the defect in amino acid so again the more you can refine the phenotype the more likely you are to identify defects that are there at the level of the beta cell go let's go back to the guitar study for a second how many people were in that study about 220 okay it's a pry big study when you're doing all you know these in clamp studies and these you know these kind of measurements are not easy to do that was published when uh let's see I would say the one and A2 year data were probably about 2018 and the three-year data I would say 2021 22 something like that I can send you all the references we'll we'll yeah we'll link to all of these in our show notes for folks um yeah just simply phenomenal let me ask a question if you um take an individual with type 2 diabetes or insulin or insulin resistance and you uh presumably collecting urinary C peptide for 24 hours is the best surrogate for insulin total insulin secretion no well it's an index okay so if you could quantify total area under the curve of insulin for a person and then you gave them a glp1

[01:59:03] Agonist is total insulin going up or down depends because you have a competing factors going on here uh and I'm not trying to be elusive because what I'm telling you is actually real it's what what happens so uh the drug is going to kick out insulin and C peptid is going to go up Y and now the glucose is going to come down and then you need less insulin and then you need less so depending upon the relationship okay when you look in absolute terms okay the

[01:59:37] C peptide ins levels actually may be lower but now when you express how much C peptide comes up for the rise in glucose huge increase okay so you always have to have uh in a a something that you compare it to and that's the increment in glucose and anytime you look at how much insulin comes out or C peptide which is another confusing factor which I'll mention in a second you always have to relate it to the the glucose area when you do that a huge increase in in beta cell function okay and the other thing you have to be very careful about is you need to be measuring C peptide not insulin because what we've shown is that when and this is a compensatory mechanism maybe just tell folks

[02:00:22] I threw out C peptide as though everybody knew what it is that's a mistake tell people what C peptide is and what its relationship is to insulin y so when you ingest a meal uh you there's a precursor that contains both C peptide and insulin proinsulin and so you split off C peptide and you split off insulin and they both come out in the one:1 molar ratio the problem is half of the insulin that comes out is taken up by the liver so you never see it in the circulating bloodstream the C peptide is not taken up by the liver so everything that comes out you see in the circulation so when we want to know how much insulin was secreted we actually don't measure the insulin we measure the

[02:01:03] C peptide and that's the true measure now the other confounding feature here is and we shown this and this has now been reproduced by many other people is that when you become insulin resistant and diabetic your beta cells don't secrete enough insulin that's one of the big defects how do you compensate you don't destroy the insulin that's secreted so the the the degradation of insulin becomes markedly impaired so you can have a high insulin level either because you secrete too much insulin or because you don't destroy the insulin so measuring the insulin level is not a good measure of beta cell function if you want to know about insulin secretion measure the C peptide and express it per uh rise in glucose it gets a little bit more clouded because your beta cell also can recognize how insulin resistant you are and so it knows look if you're this insulin resistant I need to secrete more insulin if you're very insulin sensitive like you're a lean person with normal glucose Torance you don't want to secrete much insulin or you get hypoglycemic how does your beta cell recognize that well that's somewhat controversial we I can give you my thoughts about it but in either case so measuring beta cell function is not just simply measuring insulin that's probably bad yeah measuring C peptide is better measuring C peptide per rise and glucose is better and then for some way or another if you can express this all per insulin resistance this is called the disposition index something that Dr

[02:02:33] Steven Khan developed with Daniel Port many many years ago so simply looking as I said as insulin or trying to do an ogtt and come up and say you know how the beta cell is working that's not so good and that's why I say like in the Qatar study in the edting study we're doing such sophisticated measures of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function you do 350 people that's like doing one of these big cardiovascular studies with 5,000 people in it uh the pathophysiology will always tell you the truth in my opinion uh if you know what the problem is and you correct the problem the A1C is going to get better uh Ada does not emphasize pathophysiology you know yeah you had

[02:03:22] Jerry Schulman on I'm sure Jerry will tell you exactly the same he and I think very similar you understand what causes a disease and then you can come with a treatment that will make it work do you have any concerns with long-term safety or anything other than simply the economics of the glp 1's in this current generation again huge huge leap forward between liraglutide and semaglutide and uh I've discussed briefly Elsewhere on the podcast what the road map looks like for how many of these drugs are in the pipeline oh yeah there seems to be no end in sight and we're going to look back at semaglutide and say God that thing was pedestrian that's what's going to happen so what give us the bare case what should we be concerned with what should we at least looking out for yeah I would say overall at the present time uh I would consider these drugs to be quite safe the the major issue is you have to go slow because of the GI toxicity where is the controversy involved and it's something that I'm involved with myself uh when you lose 20 or 30% of your body weight you lose muscle mass okay uh now uh I just gave a talk on this to one of the pharmaceutical companies that are involved in this area I'm not going to name the name of the the pharmaceutical company uh but I started off uh by saying look here is now a study with real data this is a a a gastric bypass surgery study r y bypass and the people lost I think it was 33% of their body weight and their lean body mass came down quite significantly one of the problems is people M measure lean body mass and that's not a real measure of muscle mass in fact it's can be a very bad measure you should measure muscle mass but let's assume that the lean body mass largely reflects it's a reasonable assumption muscle mass so muscle mass came down okay so why is that so bad but how much did it come down because if your total body mass came down by 33% but 3/4 of that mass was fat and only one quarter of that was lean we would consider that acceptable and this is where the controversy is cuz no one has really measured muscle mass that's right we're doing it okay we we will have a definitive answer and you're doing that with Mr MRI yeah okay so it's it's gold stand okay but now I said look in this study they they measured absolute strength you can do grip strength or leg strength and absolute strength went down a little bit okay maybe 25% were these patients exercising

[02:06:09] During the period of weight loss no no no no no then they said let's Express strength for weight loss up by 50% per appendicular it goes up by 50% and then they said how far can they walk they went from walking 200 yards to two miles and then say one of the things is how many times can you get up out of a chair in a certain period of time they increase like three or four fold and and they they they measured your V2 Max H yeah of course which is heavily dependent on weight as well yeah it all got better but in absolute terms did V2 Max get better not necessarily yeah the total V2 not normalized per kilogram no everything got better okay so uh so I said so why you guys that's counterintuitive by the way normally when you lose weight V2 Max in liters per minute does not improve because you have less metabolic tissue but but uh here for whatever the reasons are maybe all of the fat that's pushing on your lungs so you can't oxygenate the epicardial fat uh that's not allowing your heart to contract the fat that's in the heart that's causing myocardial lipotoxicity which I believe is real these things are all changing in a positive way uh so again it's a balance of yeah so uh of course they don't like this because if the people and they had all kinds of psychological questionnaires wait why weren't they happy with these results well because uh they now the companies are all looking at developing drugs that will preserve the muscle mass or increase the muscle mass but basically what I'm saying is that look there's a huge it's lean body mass but we have to say it's cting muscle mass uh everything gets better the patient feels better they can walk better they feel stronger etc etc why are you so worried about muscle mass like I look all these gloomy faces because they're all developing myostatin

[02:08:04] Inhibitors or event and and so then the next slide comes up and says retort here's a good thing okay so now uh if you uh lose all of this body weight and you improve insulin sensitivity in muscle uh and you improve it in the heart uh and there are cardiovascular benefits and you correct the uh Improvement in all of the cardiovascular risk factors now even though uh you've lost muscle mass if you've improved insulin sensitivity there may be an enormous benefit of seeing the Improvement in the muscle insulin sensitivity even though you've lost muscle mass uh and they do have some concerns about these drugs these my that inhibites that actually may have some negative effects in the heart and my suggestion is actually you may find a big Improvement in myocard function uh from uh these uh how where are myostatin

[02:09:04] Inhibitors in their development right now phase two yeah yes and um of course I think we've talked about myostatin before on the podcast when you inhibit myostatin you increase the expression of striad muscle of which cardiac is striad work through the event in uh to a and 2 B system uh um do you think that's a more promising pathway than the fallatin pathway where fist Statin yes I do increasing increasing fallatin inhibits myostatin but this is a more direct way to go about it this is a more direct way to do it so you can either have their their antibodies uh by guab uh to uh myostatin or you can interfere with the signaling uh receptor itself and we think that this can still be effective in a fully developed and mature adult clearly this would be effective during development and we see that in the animal work is it how effective is it cuz a lot of the animal work as sort of a character stuff it's Knockouts right they take myat Knockouts and they look like bodybuilders yeah but if you take a mature chicken or a mouse that's 2 years old and you give it a myostatin antibody how robust is the response even more so what about in a human yeah exactly we don't know the answer to that so what the phase two studies obviously the toxicity passed in F in phase one yes yeah I I I'm not concerned there doesn't seem to be any adverse effect of these drugs or they wouldn't got through phase two and they're actually some fairly large phase what's the indication the indication is sarcopenia I I don't know

[02:10:38] I'm uh you know the uh uh the FDA if you have a sarcopenic disease there are criteria that the FDA has established if you want to develop a drug that you have to meet certain CR I'm not an expert in this so I I can't tell you exactly what these criteria are but they are pretty well established okay uh now for these kind of people and I'm going to come back you ask me about lean people I'll come back to that in a second uh because this is really an issue uh what let's say I put you on a gp1 receptor Agonist and you lost 25% of your body weight and I put you on a my

[02:11:17] Statin inhibitor and that prevented the muscle loss didn't increase it but just prevented it so relatively but that would be ridiculous I mean if you took a 200 pound individual yeah who's 30% body fat yeah so they're they've they've got 60 lbs of adapost tissue on them y if you took 25% of their body weight off you take them down to 150 pounds but you're telling me potentially we prevent any deterioration of lean mass yeah that means they're down to 10 lbs of fat Mass on 150 PB frame so I'm making an assumption this pretty rad this is remarkable right so let's say that happened okay what would be the fda's criteria I'm going to give you approval for this drug I think the FDA would ask that you've also improved function in some way yes and the function would probably be H have to be determined through absolute strength not relative strength would be my guess so I I don't know the answer to this question cuz that's CU cuz the way

[02:12:27] I think about these drugs is less about that situation uh it's more in the it's more in the sarcopenic adult this is the Le particularly the older person that's right that's right this the elderly individual who's sarcopenic and whose fall risk is enormous yes and their risk of fall and uh morbidity and mortality is very high yeah and in that individual

[02:12:52] I don't think the FDA will be satisfied with simply an increase in lean body mass unless it is accompanied by strength now I think that some of the tests that are used here are silly I think the six-minute walk test should be folded up discarded put in the waist basket and never discuss again it is such a stupid test they do it all the time I know they do just makes me want to scream we need much more rigorous tests than a six-minute walk test we need need a test that is actually uh more of a submaximal test so if we're testing cardiorespiratory Fitness or some sort of peak aerobic fitness we have to do more than walking and if we're testing strength I much prefer grip strength leg extension bench press uh yeah again these can be done with machines they can be done very safely but we really need to test strength well you see you're raising very important and critical issues because there are many many companies that are going ahead with these drugs that increased muscle mass but to me okay increasing muscle mass what does that mean there needs to be some functional translation of that and and by the way there could be other functional benefits that exceed strength for example glucose disposal could be a functional sensitivity that's the one I put at the top of the list get rid of the insulin resistance that the FDA won't give them credit for that I don't think yeah but but I think that again it's harder to tease out because there's more moving pieces and they might argue there are easier ways to increase insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal but you know one way to think about this is to go back to what if you did at the old fashion way what if you got in the gym and lifted a bunch of Weights that's been done yeah and it increases insulin sensitivity and functional strength and so the question is can we replicate that pharmacologically uh and that is actually exactly the way I ended my discussion to these people I showed them what resistance training did and if you could show what resistance training did uh with your muscle mass uh increase then you'd have something but you need to design the studies appropriately and as I said and as you said I I I don't know what the criteria are going to be that the FDA uses to judge these things they do have a sarcopenia set of criteria but that's a very different group of people that we're talking about but this comes uh and hits home to one of the things you asked me earlier what about the lean person who's 80 years of age is this the right drug for that person I don't know uh maybe not but now let's say you have a healthy 80-year-old person and everybody in the family lives to be 105 and they have diabetes Well they're at risk to you know uh the toxic effects of hypoglycemia uh would it be reasonable to treat uh that person we know this powerful effects on the beta cell I would say it would be quite reasonable but I think you need to monitor what's happening to their weight and other features here's a bigger issue childhood obesity you are obese when you're four years of age you're going to be obese when you're adult and and your life expectancy will be significantly shorter and your quality of life will be significantly reduced now make it even better adolescence these young kids with diabetes they don't respond to any of the drugs what is the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in underage 18 uh it's uh increasing but I would say maybe around 4 5% something like that five one in 20 teenagers has type two diabetes I guess

[02:16:33] I'm biased by San Antonio because we have more people with type two diabetes in our clinic but you would you would and you could say potentially in San Antonio one out of 20 teenagers it's going to be very high gosh that is pre-diabetes and I'll tell you about the pre-diabetes study that we did so now let's say you're and we know these studies are out there these kids uh uh in this big NIH sponsored study uh they don't respond to metform and cellone uras they don't respond to any drugs very well even the gop1 agonists uh the first study has just come out they respond better it's a log glutide study they don't have any two but if you just clinically if you're in the clinic and you're treating them without you know you're using the best drugs you have available you're you're you're in trouble and we know wait why because you can't get them controlled why there's Inc they're so insulant resistant much more more so than adults uh the these are well-published studies is this not so much is the is the causality here not is this really a selection bias where for someone to develop type 2 diabetes as a 16-year-old the underlying genetics and pathology are so severe that the current crop of drugs are the problem as opposed to when you take the current crop of drugs and you apply them to people who are young they don't work uh all three cuz I'm going to add one more genetic predisposition so Hispanic population huge problem obesity all of these kids are huge okay so you don't have the lean diabetic phenotype in this age no not in these people and then the drugs don't work very well in this so all all three of these things and what now has come it's called The Rise study uh and as these kids have been followed up they're starting to develop kidney disease they're even I'm told a couple of people have had m in their 20s they're incredibly difficult uh to control what do you think I mean not that I mean yes we're going to argue that these kids are that this is due to what they're eating but what is it in the environment that is so obesogenic to these kids I'll come back to this in a second uh but I want to raise the issue now let's say you're 16 and you are met for and these drugs are not your A1C is nine I you you can put someone on Monaro and they're going to have to take this for the rest of their life because as soon as you stop the drug okay so this is uh what I treat the person of course

[02:19:07] I can't let the A1C at nine but that if you take that 16-year-old with a hemog A1c of nine and you give them Manjaro where are they in a year uh I think that if they can afford the drug and they stay on the drug drug the three big ifs if the doctor knows what to do I know what to do uh if the patient will cooperate with you if you don't they'll lose every time and if they can afford if you can satisfy those three FS that person we know from the studies be pretty well controlled and insurance what what fraction of insured patients will have coverage on mararo if their

[02:19:42] A1C is nine I don't I can't answer that but uh does CMS cover it does Medicaid cover that uh yes if you have diabetes okay I don't know the M coverage I think is pretty good if you have diabetes okay if you have obesity that's a different if you have obesity without that's a whole different issue y should you be treating these young kids who are obesity is a disease okay it's got all kinds of problems should you put these young kids on these newer drugs and knowing that all I did is change you from food addiction to drug addiction I didn't do anything else uh it's almost like alcohol addiction okay uh there are drugs that thinks I can give you that can help you but they tend to relapse uh food addiction I put you on the drug you lose weight you stop the drug you regain the weight this is a huge Public Health concern I I I is almost way be beyond my capacity because finances are involved here can we afford to treat 42% of the people in the US are obese or is there some way amongst the 42% we can Define who are the people who are insulin resistant who are the people have the metabolic syndrome that we know they're at risk that we can treat them my guess is that's the great majority of that 42% of the people can we treat all of those people and moreover they going to stay on the drug we know on average what the data is saying I put you on the drug it we don't know all the reasons why but within a year a half of the people stop the drug yeah and it's probably a combination of cost and side effect yeah and uh my patients very commonly tell me you know say Ralph uh I enjoy eating and

[02:21:28] I can't eat anymore and they some people just tell me they they just want to eat and and so I'm going to get fat again so I'm going to eat some is GI side effects and some is cost $1,000 a month is a lot of money for it's insane yeah for people um so Ralph again I just kind of bring it back to this this question which I mean everybody wants to understand this which is what has changed so much in the last 30 years that has created this epidemic and you know um everybody has their favorite pet theory for what it is it's the sugar it's the carbs it's the plastics it's the video games it's the Internet it's the whatever perhaps suggesting that it's many many things what is what is your best explanation for what's going on I would say all of the above uh processed foods uh calorically dense foods lack of exercise are critical but these are I would say the stimuli that has done something that's changed the neuros circuitry in the brain so yes there's a stimulus and because now you've been oversubscribed to the stimuli uh that's now initiated a process in the brain which is going to be a self-fulfilling propess this something that I'm very interested in Dr Peter Fox and I at the at the health science center uh but if you go through the literature and we've published on this uh as well in the areas of the brain that control food intake and I'm not talking about the hypothalamus that kind of regulates your your basil energy intake what you need to be keep your BMI of 25 do what you do during the day but what is it that makes your BMI go to 35 uh those that's all related to the hedonic areas in the brain the pamin the amigdala the prefrontal cortex Etc and then uh when you do structural MRI what you can show is that those areas in the brain the gray matter is shrunk down uh and if you now map the neuros circuitry which Peter

[02:23:37] Fox uh has been involved with uh you can see that there's clear disruption using functional M uh of the neuros circuitry in the brain uh we have a particular interest in defining where this dysfunction occurs and we have some ideas which I'm not going to go into but how we might be able to sort of reprogram uh the brain and sort of in concert with this uh these are not um data but these are data that are published in literature and I think I mentioned this earlier if you do an insulin clamp okay uh I told you that in

[02:24:16] Ur your brain doesn't respond by taking up glucose but in people who are obese actually almost in proportionate to how obese you are in these areas in in the brain hedonic areas there's a marked increase in uh it's called fluod deoxy glucose which is the pet Rayo St Trace we use in these areas and that correlates inversely with the muscle insulin resistance the more muscle the more insulin resistant they are in the muscle the more fdg glucose upake there is in the brain now this is very interesting because what it say there's a connection that somehow or another we believe that the brain is talking to the muscle or the muscle is talking to the brain uh and that uh that uh somehow or other the brain is playing a very important role in the development of the insulin resistance and that in large part that this deranged neuros circuitry which is related to food intake is now making you overeat and as you overeat then all of the things that we know that we studied that other people have studied that go with lipotoxicity you put fat in the muscle you're insulin resistant you put fat in the liver you got Nash and N what people have totally overlooked you put fat in the kidney you get kidney uh disease uh you put fat in your yeah yeah so so you've been in San Antonio since the late 80s when did you really start to notice this was a problem at least in your community almost instantaneously uh because uh I run the Texas even in kids even in kids uh and uh it was very so can't we can't blame video games we can't blame social media because that wasn't going on in the late 80s so I never saw fat kids at Yale and I was on the faculty from 75 to 88 and I I kind of thought back uh now I would say New

[02:26:11] Haven's not a large Hispanic but it's more African American but I don't remember seeing you know 12-year-old kids with type two diabetes and when I came here uh and I remember this very distinctly they saying H you're crazy we you could you don't see kids with type two diabetes believe me I see them and what did your colleagues at San Antonio tell you as far as when they started to notice that in the Hispanic kids I think they just I I don't know that I can give you a specific time that they told me except they knew it but so okay what about in non-hispanic kids because if the Hispanic kids are are genetically predisposed to this then the question becomes when did you begin to see this in African-American kids and Caucasian kids yeah so we don't have a large uh

[02:27:04] African-American population here but like in Philadelphia There's a lady syv Sil slavian uh she sees the same thing uh and she sees I think it's a significant African-American population so I think that in certain ethnic minorities where the genes for diabetes are enriched that those are the populations that are uh predisposed and do you think this is mostly an energy balance issue and therefore it's mostly a food environment issue no I think it's both so I told you I'd come back to the genetic study that we did so uh we we uh in the it's a an Italian fellow was with me giovan Gully a long long time ago here in San Antonio we wanted to know what is the earliest defect that you can see in uh people going to develop type two diabetes so we said okay in the

[02:28:00] Hispanic Community it's very common to see Mom and Dad with diabetes and it's very common to see a lot of children in these families so we said why don't we go look at the children and let's see uh if we can Define because they're at high risk yeah uh and if you have mom and dad with diabetes you probably have a 70 80% chance if you're Hispanic if you're born in that family developing diabetes it was very easy to find the children the problem was we couldn't find lean children so it took us a while because if you're obese then you got the lipotoxicity so we finally found them this a jci paper I believe uh and so we did insulin clamp there is resistant as their parents they have normal glucose tolerance why because the insul levels are astronomical and then we do a muscle

[02:28:48] B how how high just for understanding oh they're like two two two times uh normal even higher sometimes we do a muscle biopsy the same defect in the insulin signaling pathway how many of the how many of the tyrosine kyes defects do they have they have starts at irs1 insulin binding to the receptor is okay just like their parents the ability to activate the insulin signaling pathway the L IRS one it's already well established which ends in particular it starts at the level of IRS one starts at the first one oh so it's not just one enzyme though well it no it's IRS one you can't tyrosine phosphorate it you cannot activate P3 okay so it starts with IRS one y and then the other thing Jerry and I have both done this in somewhat different ways uh so uh Jerry I'm talking about

[02:29:42] Jerry SCH uh he uses anmr by looking at uh phosphat derivatives uh even though I believe the the primary defect is in the signaling pathway uh there's clearly severe impairments and glucose transport in phosphorilation uh his work would suggest that the primary defect is at the level of glucose transport we did we developed a novel triple tracer technique uh using three

[02:30:12] Isotopes infused into the brachial artery we believe that the primary defect is at the level of hexokinase and phosphor lating uh glucose so we kind of agree to disagree because we can't do the study and we'd have to do the MRI study at the same time we're doing the triple tracer technique in addition to the insulin signaling defect there's a severe defect in glucose transport and phosphor relation once um let's just make sure people understand this is this we're kind of getting into some biochemistry here yeah when glucose enters the cell passively through the GL transp GL transporter yep it gets free glucose in the cell yes then to metabolize it yeah the first step to that is hexokinase yeah which takes a phosphate off ATP and puts it on the sixth position if I'm not mistaken it's a specific type of hexokinase so it's hexokinase 2 yeah because there's a different one in the muscle and in the liver correct and that is correct yep so uh Jerry would say the primary defect is in glute four the transporter yes I would say yes that is severely impaired but even more s what does remind me what

[02:31:22] Jerry believes is wrong with the glute for transporter uh that it doesn't work normally I thought it worked fine it's just not getting the signal to work because of irs1 that's where the controversy is how how do when you have a severe we already we were the first to show this defect in muscle fact we're the only people I think that have shown this in human muscle it's been shown in rats Etc that to me you know metabolism in rats and mice is so different this is all people data okay so you're saying but we we it's possible that just having the irs1 problem is enough it's also possible that even if irs1 is functioning reasonably if glute 4 is not getting up that's the problem there is evidence to support that and then it's also possible that even if all those things work if you don't get hexokinase to phosphorate glucose you back up the whole system and I can show you that is a primary defect in pyate dehydrogen gen and and glycogen synthes this comes back

[02:32:22] I have an ominous octet for the insulin resistance okay this this why people don't understand look there are eight organ sort of things that are a problem there are eight problems I can show you within the muscle why you think one drug is going to correct all these problems we need drugs to work on the beta cell we need insulin sensitizers we probably need different types of insulin sensitizing drugs we need drugs that reverse the lipotoxicity uh and uh you know will we ever have a single Magic Bullet that corrects all of these uh you know probably not I think until we discover the genetic basis and remember

[02:33:01] I said that diabetes is a heterogeneous disease and it I I I did in diabetes metabolism reviews I would say 30 years ago I wrote a review article that said I can put a defect in the muscle and reproduce diabetes I can put a defect in the liver and reproduce diabetes I can put a defect in the fat cell and reproduce diabetes I can put a defect in the beta cell and reproduce diabetes and

[02:33:30] I went back and read that and I said I can put a defect that starts in the brain and reproduce diabetes so we see someone with an aeny of eight or nine they all these defects we've been talking about they're already there so you put that defect in the fat cell they can look lean and there's a syndrome called alum syndrome there's a specific defect in the this is white adopite there's this Phil Sher will love me for saying this he's the like top Guru in osy metabolism up in Dallas uh and uh uh it's alcam syndrome there's a specific defect in the glucose transporter and white adapost tissue you know what happens you become diabetic you know what happens you gain weight you know what happens you get Nash so here here's a defect that I said like 30 years ago I I just postulated and said here's a syndrome and not only that now that they defined this in people uh in this paper they then went to the animal model and they knocked out the gene that's causing the defect and they reproduce diabetes in the normal rat model uh Mouse model so Ralph I want to close by bringing it back to something that people can do to help um understand if they're at risk either lean or otherwise we talked about it at the outset but didn't go into it in detail which was the ogt yeah the oral glucose tolerance test now again um none of us have the privilege of being able to use a ug glycemic clamp both clinically as

[02:35:03] Physicians or as experienc it as patients so we're going to have to kind of rely on other things we're going to have to rely on body fat we're going to have to rely on triglycerides we're going to have to rely on hemoglobin A1c although I find that to be a particularly useless uh metric not that useless but it it at the individual level I find it very unhelpful I think at the population level it's great and in Deltas it's great but boy the correlation between hemoglobin A1c and realized glucose levels it's it's pretty weak but let's talk about the ogtt because this is not a test that is done frequently yeah I believe it should be Y and I'd love to have you walk us through the interpretation of the following I'm going to give you a couple scenarios so case one I'm making this up as we go so you got you got a person who starts out all these people are going to start out normal okay they're going to start out with a glucose of 90 and an insulin of six yeah okay at 30 minutes this is after 75 gram of oral glucose the um the insulin Rises to uh 90 the I'm nervous yep the the the glucose Rises to 130 at 60 Minutes the glucose is uh down to 100 the insulin is down to 60 and we'll just do one more check at 2 hours uh the glucose at this point is uh 60 yeah and the insulin is 20 that is a pre-diabetic

[02:36:34] State this is a very insulin resistant person uh and 2 hour later hypoglycemia is a reflection of the beta cell's early insulin secretion this is kind of a pre-diabetic State yeah and this I so agree with you completely and we see this all the time Ralph this is a person by the way with a perfectly normal hemoglobin A1c yes and this is a person who gets past all the time as totally normal the severely insin resistance your glucose is 90 your hemoglobin A1c is normal and your insulin is six even if the doctor is checking insulin but as you point out the thing that trips you off is not their glucose 90 to 130 to 100 is amazing it's 90 was how high the insulin was at 30 seconds and of course they overshot which is why they become hypoglycemic yes okay well known yep okay's go another one this person also starts at 90 and 6 at 30 minutes they go to uh 180 yeah insulin goes to 30 yeah at 60 Minutes they go to 200 insulin is 40 they diabetic we showed but just be clear this is a person these are almost real cases by the way this person whose hemoglobin A1c is 5.6 got it we already published this yeah the best predictor of who's going to get diabetes is a 1our glucose greater than 155 uh and this is uh from prospective data from the San Antonio heart study also from the botania study where these people have been followed up we were the first people to publish this oh I I'd say seven8 nine 10 years ago there have been I'd say at least 15 to 20 studies that have reproduced what we showed uh 10 years ago can 1 hour glucose is more than 155 you're in trouble and that's a great predictor of type 2 diabetes regardless of all the other metrics yes and if you also happen to be hypo insul liic that adds more to the predictive value but just pick one 155 without knowing the insulin that's a huge predictor of whether you're going to develop diabetes or not that's from the

[02:38:40] San Antonio uh heart study and that's also from the botania study uh and also from our Vegas study okay next case I'm not even going to give you the numbers I'll just describe it this is a person who has a delayed onset of insulin so in other words they start out normal at 90 30 minute insulin is deficient that's a predictor as well yes so what's going on in this person where 30 minute insulin does nothing glucose Rises yeah and then at an hour and 90 minutes the pancreas kicks on and starts to dispose of glucose what's happening in that person that's a primary beta cell defect and one of the earliest things you can detect in people who are predisposed to develop diabetes is loss of first phase insulin secretion now first phase insulin secretion is strictly speaking can only be measured with the hypoglycemic clamp that we developed so when I acutely raise the glucose from say you know 90 and I raise it to 200 in the first 10 minutes there's a big spike of insulin that comes out that is typically lost in people who are going to develop type 2 diabetes in its counterpart during the ogtt is the insulin level at 30 minutes okay uh so when you ingest the glucose of course the rising glucose is more gentle when I acutely raise your glucose from 90 to 200 that big spike of glucose gives the first phase uh but uh a low insulin response in the first 30 minutes is another predictor of who's going to get into trouble um we use the following numbers in our practice as what we consider what we want to see do you think we're being too aggressive at Time

[02:40:20] Zero we want to see you less than 90 and less than six at time 30 minutes we want to see you less than 140 and less than 40 at time 60 minutes we want to see you less than 130 and less than 30 and at 2 hours we want to see you less than uh sorry at 90 minutes we want to see you less than 110 and less than 20 do you think we're being too hard yeah you might be being overly aggressive but for sure if they meet those numbers you're probably say

[02:40:49] Ralph I don't know where the time went today but it went and um this was a fascinating discussion I could talk about this stuff all day long and it's interesting because someone listening to this podcast who heard the podcast with Jerry uh Schulman from probably three years ago will be pleased because the overlap is virtually zero right I mean that's what's amazing about a topic as rich as this is you can talk to two of the world's experts and have two completely different conversations conversation with Jerry focused so much on the pathophysiology of insulin resistance here we focused much more on the actual organ specific aspect of type 2 diabetes we got a master class in the pharmacology of it and then I think kind of brought it back to you know ways to diagnose it um if you're sluming it with those of us in the clinic who don't have clamps so maybe we should in the future we do one with both Jerry and I I will 100% uh agree that that that that in a few years we come back and we do we do a double version of this and would be fantastic I sign up all right Ralph thank you so much not just obviously for this but for your contribution to this field okay I appreciate it this was wonderful [Music]
