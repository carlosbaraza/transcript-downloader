## Description

Eric Verdin is a physician-scientist & the CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. In this episode, Eric traces his scientific journey from studying viruses to leading aging research at the Buck Institute, offering insights into how aging impairs immune & nervous system function—including thymic shrinkage, chronic inflammation, & reduced vaccine response—& how these changes impact lifespan. He explores the metabolic underpinnings of aging, such as oxidative stress & insulin & IGF-1 signaling, & he discusses practical tools like zone 2 cardio, ketogenic diets, & GLP-1 drugs. The conversation also covers declining NAD levels with age, the roles of NAD-consuming enzymes such as sirtuins & CD38, & what current NAD-boosting strategies can & can’t accomplish. Eric weighs in on promising longevity interventions including rapamycin, growth hormone for thymic regeneration, & anti-inflammatory therapies, the promise & limitations of current biological age tests, & the potential of combining epigenetic, proteomic, & organ-specific metrics with wearables to guide personalized longevity care.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I talk about these things called the four horsemen. The four things that are basically coming for us all. I really should have added a fifth horsemen and that is immune health. Thank you for bringing this up. There are two organs that are rate limiting in terms of your aging and it's the central nervous system and the immune system.

[00:00:17] What is our strategy for mitigating immune decline? The proof is in the pudding pudding in a way that we know exercising and a combination of exercise is the best anti-aging intervention we have. Turn over to where you wanted to around metabolism. What is it about metabolism that really is so important? I'm convinced that it is fuel utilization. I think ketones are probably the the cleanest fuel to burn in terms of again byproducts oxidative stress.

[00:00:44] You're going to put more GLP1 in the system. you're going to overcome the resistance at the beta cell. You make more insulin. You now have better glucose control. Everybody wins. I just wanted to really experiment for myself to try to see, okay, what is this drug really doing? And it's it's been nothing short of remarkable, I think.

[00:01:02] How could it be that supplementing NAD does not lead to a longer, better life or some health benefit? Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia.

[00:01:20] Uh, Eric, thank you so much for uh for coming to to Austin. I know it wasn't just to talk to me. I know that half of it was uh was getting you to drive on the track at Kota tomorrow with me. So, uh we're going to have some fun there. My pleasure. But um as much as I think the two of us could sit here and talk about race cars for the next three hours, I don't think the audience would appreciate it or care for it as much as they will care for what we will talk about which is um your work in geoscience. Um so maybe give folks a little bit of a sense of what attracted you to this field and uh you know how your how your journey and background brought you where you are. It's a bit of a serendipitous type of story in a way that I I'm an MD by training from

[00:02:05] Belgium. Did my last year of medical school at Harvard and this just uh uh sort of opened my world my eyes to a whole world. Uh I was the first person in my family to go to college. So this was uh you know ending up at Harvard with some of the best teachers, some of the best students was just mind-blowing.

[00:02:22] And I went to medical school wanting to do research. there was never had that sort of a doctor fiber I call it. really wanted to actually do research and um and so after this um finished medical school and came back for directly a postoc uh at at the Joslyn Clinic working on diabetes and metabolism and um and so this is where the story gets circuitous um ended up becoming interested in the the reason for uh the ethology of type 1 diabetes u and worked on viruses and autoimmunity um this eventually led me to you know mostly a career in verology which confuses people. So I spent many years working on on a variety of viruses including HIV and and herpes viruses and so on. And through that work, we ended up cloning a family of protein called the uh uh some of the first epigenetic regulators, the

[00:03:16] HDAXs. And the HDAX at the time that was that was 1996, we were responsible for the cloning of a whole family of these epigenetic regulators. Um ended up being important in aging. And starting in around 1995, 1996, my lab slowly shifted towards the study of aging. And to this point today actually I only have one last postoc in the lab who's working on on HIV. The whole lab is actually focused on on epigenetics, imunology and metabolism. So that the interface between these uh these variables.

[00:03:52] So in some way it's it's it's the beauty of an academic career which um I've just followed my interest and uh and sometimes followed the money a little bit in terms of funding. Yeah. Um and uh and now I mean I have another you know additional responsibility which is to lead the Buck Institute for Research on

[00:04:09] Aging. So I split my time between the lab and uh the some more leadership type of activities. You mentioned two things there uh metabolism and immunology. Um talk a little bit more about how each of those individually contributes to aging. I think most people will intuitively understand it but but talk maybe a little deeper about it. Well, first imunology uh is central to aging in many respects. Um one of the and we can I hope we can talk get to talk about this later. There is data showing that there are two organs that are rate limiting in terms of your aging and it's the central nervous system and the immune system.

[00:04:50] And the reason uh for this is actually uh one could have predicted this based on the fact that both organs are distributed organs. If you think of your immune system, it's located in pretty much throughout the whole organism. And so its activity can influence the the well-being or the the functioning of every single organ. The same goes for uh the central nervous system. And there's recent study coming out actually from the lab of Tony Whisker showing that uh those biomarkers that measure aging in those organs appears to be uh the most predictive of your lifespan. There's also um incredible data showing um that if you induce a specific lesion in the immune system for example in in mice model if you if you knock out ERCC1 DNA damage repair only in in the bone marrow so that the whole immune system is affected you actually induce accelerated aging in the whole organism and scinsessence in every single organ. So there's the the immune system in what in what model?

[00:05:58] Uh it's been done in two different models in mice. So this been done with the ERCC1 mutation. It's also been done by knocking down the the major trans tam the major transcription factor for mitochondria. So if you induce mitochondrial dysfunction only in the immune system, you induce secondary scinessence in the whole organ.

[00:06:15] Do you think that would be true in mammals? Sorry, in humans. It's that that's always it's a million-dollar question. in in some way the it's been shown in in two different models in mice B6 which which yeah B6 I don't remember the exact strain of the mouse but u uh there's no reason why it should be different frankly um and it speaks to the importance of the immune system the second way for the immune system is through chronic inflammation which is you know tied cause and effect in the whole aging process um now and we can talk about this later as well I find it fascinating you know the whole idea of chronic inflammation which is induced by the aging process but which itself actually further accelerates aging. So there's really a lot of lot of work that's being conducted in this area. Um the other one that you were asking is metabolism I think is can I ask you a question before we go?

[00:07:12] Yeah. Um that's a very interesting idea that two organ systems that are going to be rate limiting in age are the central nervous system and the immune system both of which are distributed. Where would you put the endothelium in that list as well? Right. The endothelium is also quite distributed across the organism and do you think that there's an inevitability to basically endothelial damage as a process of aging which of course results in the leading cause of death the the atherosclerotic diseases. Would you would you do you think of it the same way or do you think of it as different?

[00:07:44] It's not sort of defined as an organ by itself. It's a cell type but I agree with you has incredible importance uh and especially as it affects the you know the heart and the cardiovascular system and the brain. Um but I I think of of it as not so much as an organ but more as a sort of a principle that maintenance of barrier function. Yeah. and and not only in in the endthelium but also in the skin in the bloodb brain barrier are emerging as key areas to focus on if you want to maximize your longevity.

[00:08:19] Yeah, I I want to come back to this in great detail, Eric, but let's for the sake of summary and synthesis turn over to where you wanted to around metabolism. So metabolism is uh essential uh to life expectancy. If you look at uh and for a number of reasons and and um one of them I I'm convinced even though that theory has been somewhat discredited the whole oxidative stress theory of aging I still think oxygen is one of the major um major problems associated with the aging process. You know we have not been able to target the oxidative stress uh using antioxidant that has failed. It doesn't mean that the whole oxidative stress theory of aging is not valuable.

[00:09:07] I think living in an oxidative environment is really you know is is one of the mechanisms that leads to aging not the only one aging is pleomorphic. Um, so but just to make sure folks understand what you're saying, Eric, um, you're saying that, um, that the the generation of free radicals through oxygen, so I don't know how technical we want to get for people, but I I I think unfortunately we might need to get a little more technical and and apologies to those who don't want to go this deep, but but we have to talk about kind of what the role of the electrons are in oxygen and why uh, free radicals form and and what they do. So, so maybe we do go a little deeper here and explain what you're saying because it's a it's a it's a very important concept and I think we should probe it.

[00:09:50] Well, I I don't know how how much I mean maybe you you do a better job at at uh at explaining this in in a in for the lay lay person. I mean oxidative stress is the fact that um pretty much the main uh um metabolic reaction are dependent on oxygen uh which gives its electron. uh it's uh in in the so-called respiratory chain there is leakage in of these electrons that are traveling down this respiratory chain leakage at at specific places. You know if the process was 100% efficient the whole energy would be transferred from from metabolites such as uh fatty acid glucose and so on. But it turns out the the mechanism is is actually leaky.

[00:10:35] These electrons reacting with oxygen can generate these um byproducts called radical oxygen species which are highly reactive. Right? So they're not chemically stable the way we think of a normal atom of oxygen. No. And so they tend to react with proteins with fatty acid and they induce lesions. And we have a whole uh I mean the the the importance of this system in terms of um of protection against it is highlighted by the number of molecular system that we have that are actually protecting against this and and we know that as we age that leakage increases.

[00:11:14] Something about the integrity of the mitochondria and the respiratory electron transport chain degrades as we age and therefore we see more and more of this leakage. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. And so out of this came the whole idea well let's just suppress oxidative stress and you know there are chemicals even some as simple as vitamin

[00:11:36] E vitamin C that you could imagine that by chemical knowledge would be predictive to be able to quench these radical oxygen species. And so there a number of things so the idea sorry to just keep interrupting you but I we'll play off to each other to do this. So, so you eat for example an antioxidant and as you said it neutralizes that reactive oxygen species with its unstable electrons kind of like you would throw a blanket on a fire that's simmering.

[00:12:06] Exactly. And that was the hope. So um when the theory was proposed um a whole industry actually grew up out of this the whole antioxidant and the antioxidant diet and the uh you know the vitamins and so on. You can still by the way that that whole industry is still existing today. Sure does. Now um what happened is that when clinical trials were conducted in this area they failed and and so you know people who think relatively simply decided well the antioxidant failed therefore the theory has no validity and

[00:12:41] I would say not so fast because it turns out that these radical oxygen species also have important roles u they actually are inducing an inflammatory response which can be protective and a good example is uh during ex exercise. Uh there is some evidence of activation of oxidative stress during exercise and if you you know neutered this for example with anti-inflammatory you probably remember the data showing that anti-inflammatory drug tend to sort of suppress some of the beneficial effect of exercise. It's the same same whole idea. And so this is one case in which these um radical oxygen species can have um a a protective role and actually a a signaling role. So when you suppress it completely with these sort of global non-specific antioxidant essentially you not only killing the bad guys but you're also suppressing an important signaling mechanism. There's another hypothesis that I would offer which is is it possible that that there's a there's still a net negative to the free radicals. So there might be some benefits but more negatives but it could be that the trials were using agents that were simply ineffective because the problem is we don't have a great biioarker for the state of free radicals. So, it's sort of like saying,

[00:14:03] I have a hypothesis that this biological process is bad. I can't measure it really, but I think it's bad. I have a drug that I think will tamp it down. Let's give the drug the trial failed. Well, do you actually know if it tamped the thing down? Like, so you we don't even know if we tested the hypothesis.

[00:14:21] Correct. And so, those would be kind of two distinct plausibilities. I completely agree. And it's it's quite often the case is that I mean, the whole story of vitamin D is a good example. Absolutely. where where people are will tell you you know vitamin D doesn't work because they conducted clinical trials but they didn't you know fix they didn't adjust the dose they didn't measure the levels so it it's a bit the same the same story uh there are markers that you can uh actually do use in in research environment like five hydroxy noninol or protein carbonilation which are indirect markers of lipid or protein uh oxidation and how efficacious or beneficial or I guess the word is maybe um how complete are they in the scope of understanding and have we demonstrated that mega doses of vitamin E or vitamin

[00:15:08] C will indeed suppress those markers in humans? They're they're not great. They're not great. I had a colleague at the Bach Institute, Martin Brand, who is one of the leaders of the whole mitochondrial bio a field called bioenergetics, which is the study of how uh the respiratory chain and and and energy metabolism happens in mitochondria. And he came up with the idea that uh he identified uh many of the sites where these unique radical oxygen species are generated.

[00:15:36] And he was able to generate um specific inhibitors for each of the sites and and was able to show that actually u inhibition at some sites was beneficial while inhibition at other sites was not beneficial. And for so this pro project was actually supported by a pharma company which eventually decided to drop the the program um and he's retired which I think is a great loss because it is a whole program that needs that still needs to be uh pursued.

[00:16:06] So if I'm understanding what you said correctly Eric it sounds like there's a much more nuanced view. It's not that free radicals are bad and it's not that free radicals are good. It's like everything in biology. Uh it's the Goldilocks rule. You might need more of it during this circumstance in this part of the body. You might need less of it in this circumstance at this totally different part of the body. And as a result, any strategy that would try to globally suppress it could even if successful in doing it, which we haven't been able to measure, might actually not yield to a favorable outcome.

[00:16:42] Totally correct. Totally correct. And I I get frustrated by these types of the way that people sort of love to oversimplify or you know sort of erase whole fields. We've seen the and I I suspect we will get to talk about sertuins uh because the same thing has happened in the sertuins you know there's a lot of amazing work done and then a few negative results or things not working out. NAD metabolism, same thing. And I I always tell people, you know, once you get into any field of study and you go deep and you start testing in humans, um, put on your seat belt because it's not easy. And, uh, and there are no magic bullets. But I think, you know, stopping the study and saying the whole field is is BS is is really for me not the way to go. We got to keep dig deeper and eventually, you know, we'll get to that. So tell me what else within metabolism you think is kind of a hallmark of aging. So um we've obviously talked about the central part of metabolism which is respiration and ATP generation and the leakage that occurs there and and basically unfortunately that just appears to be inevitable. U yes that's totally right. We will never stop the oxygen in our environment. So yeah, um I do like to tell my patients that this is why I kind of harp on them to do a lot of zone 2 cardio training, right? So zone 2 very specifically by definition, right, is the canonical exercise you would do to maximize fat oxidation, which of course implies the most efficient use of the mitochondria.

[00:18:23] And the hypothesis, because I don't think, you know, we don't have proof of this, but the hypothesis is training at that level for specific periods of time throughout the week, is is a way to improve the health and function of your mitochondria, which would hopefully imply that you're reducing that degradation of function. Do you think there's validity to that? At least, you know, first order logic. Yeah, I mean I the proof is in the pudding pudding in a way that we know exercising and a combination of exercise is the best anti-aging intervention we have.

[00:18:58] But you think part of it is through that exact mechanism. Yeah. I mean that's that's been my hypothesis but again we can't fully glean that in in any human clinical trial. No. Hard to study. And I think you know your point allows me sort of to address your your question. What is it about metabolism that really so important? I think I'm convinced that it is fuel utilization and you mentioned you know fatty oxidation versus glycolysis and I'll add ketosis to this.

[00:19:25] I think if you think about um your metabolism is able to to oxidize a number of different substrates, amino acids, fatty acids, glucose and and ketones and lactate. and lactate and every one of those actually burns with different efficiency both being u car afficionado I think your audience probably knows also that you know there it's different to burn diesel or to burn 100 octane gas and you know if you look at that hierarchy I think ketones are probably the the cleanest fuel to burn in terms of again byproducts oxidative stress they seem to be really unique yeah how would you rank order from cleanest to dirtiest inclusive of lactate.

[00:20:11] Lactate I would not be able to to put it. I think it's probably clean. Yeah, I think my intuition is it is as well but it would be the top would be uh beta hydroxybutyrate. Beta hydroxybutyrate acettoacetate is is present at such low abundance it's probably not relevant as as a fuel fuel source. Then fatty acid next is the worst is actually glucose. And when you think about metabolism and aging, for me it goes to um a lot of the data that has emerged from um the ITP, for example, intervention testing program. This uh this

[00:20:45] Rich Miller has been on several times. I I watched your your recent podcast with uh Rich and and others. Um one of the remarkable thing when you look at the drugs that have seven or whatever 10 drugs that have emerged out of 80 y uh they are really targeting glucose metabolism and uh you know and and very via completely different mechanism.

[00:21:06] Think about a carbos which is blocking you know absorption of glucose. Think about the canosin which is you know targeting a protein has nothing to do links to protein glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Think about metformin which is you know but metformin failed. Yeah it failed but it it it's it seems to be having very powerful effect in terms of um um well it did not fail actually it failed unless it was paired with rapamy.

[00:21:32] Yes. And and in monkeys there's a study come coming out that showed that actually had an effect on lifespan. So and do you think rapamy has any impact on glucose metabolism favorably? general generally actually this isin is the the exception to this because it seems to be having some it it's not indifferent it it it has been claimed to be having an effect on uh insulin sensitivity um although although I'm not clear if that's true at the doses but anyway yeah we can come back to that

[00:22:02] I've taken rapamy I have not seen any effect on my blood sugar um now so think about you know a carbos canosine metformin u and not a GLP1 agonist which I I predict will emerge as juror protectors uh in the future. Um so I I think that's really speaks to an important aspect which is uh fuel utilization uh and how you know whether you're burning a clean fuel, whether you're burning a dirty fuel. Um you know we've put for example mice on a on a pure fat diet. These mice never saw a carbohydrate during their life and they lived longer which I thought was actually quite interesting.

[00:22:46] It is interesting Eric because a lot of the mouse literature um I think people don't read the fine print very closely and they don't notice that the typical thing you'll see is these mice were fed a highfat diet to induce obesity so that we could test you know drug A or C against obesity. But in those studies, it's not just a highfat diet. It's a highfat, high sugar diet. Right. So, they're making some insanely hyper palatable

[00:23:17] It's you know, the closest I can come up with is they're making a donut. Yes. Right. It's a fried dough, sugar food. And uh you know, so they're making basically donuts for these monkeys. And that's different than saying it's a highfat thing. So, so yeah, I think it's it's important to point out because, you know, a highfat minus the sugar might not be the same issue, right?

[00:23:40] Agree. At least in that model. Yeah. Um, so what do you think it is about glucose metabolism that that that leads to this? Because for all intents and purposes, um, let's just go through the metabolic pathways, right? So glucose, six carbons, it gets broken down into pyuvate. You get your two pyuvates for one glucose, right? And then pyuvate can it let's just assume we're doing this under aerobic conditions so we're not in a rush.

[00:24:11] We're going to take those pyuvates. Do they turn into acetal cos? I can't even remember to then enter the it's actually one pyrovate and that leads to enters the mitochondria and and becomes acetyl coa acetal. Okay. Okay. So what is it about that process that is not as efficient as when you are cleaving off carbons from a free fatty acid and those carbons are turning directly into uh I think just a straight acetal COA and then entering uh the KB cycle. What what what is the it's a very subtle difference. Why does why is one so much more inefficient?

[00:24:46] You mean why is there more calories per fatty acid or No no no that that can be explained by the stochometry. Why is one quote unquote dirtier? Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Um I I think obviously this is a really complicated question. So I I don't know that I would be able to really tell you purely as fuels whether there is a difference. I think the biggest difference is in terms of the the the whole mechanism that they elicit. And when we think about glucose, I don't think necessarily of it if you were to study it in in a tissue culture dish that one would be toxic more toxic than the other. I don't think there's any evidence for this but glucose and particularly the form of glucose that we have not evolved to actually be exposed to which is all the wheat products you know this fast form of glucose um elicits insulin secretion and I think insulin and IGF-1 but particularly insulin is the culprit in this whole process. So you're not saying that one mole of glucose, one mole of free fatty acid. We know there's a difference in

[00:25:53] ATP generation, but you're not saying that there's a difference, assuming they're both going through the mitochondria. You're not saying there's a difference in free radical formation, mole per mole, or are you saying that it's this way? There's another way to explain it, which is per mole of ATP, you need to run so much more glucose through that, of course, you're going to get more leakage. Well, the the key difference is that um the glucose is generating ATP not only via acetyl coa and pyrovate but is also generating ATP in the intracellular intracytoplasmic components. The fatty acids do not generate in the so I suspect that there might be a difference in terms of the amount of free radicals that are that are generated. Um I there is evidence but I I would not be able to site you the paper that one cleans one burns clean more cleanly than the other and I suspect it's partly the cytoplasmic component of of glucose.

[00:26:51] It's also less efficient um in terms of the amount you know of energy that's being generated per gram of fatty acid or per mole of fatty acid versus per mole of of glucose. And then going back to the insulin IGF component here, what role do you think they're playing? Critical. Um because epidemiologically and and and through studies, we know that the um insulin response to your glucose. So if you do a lot of sports, I tell I I I I'm not a proponent of the low carbohydrate or no carbohydrate diet because there's there's very little evidence that those diets are actually beneficial. You know, I gave you the example of a ketogenic diet which we did experimentally, but these are not practical diet for anyone just because the of the challenge in avoiding carbohydrates in the standard world we live in.

[00:27:44] Yes, I would say both socially, palatably, I mean there's so many reasons. I I I went on a ketogenic diet. I I from what I remember, I think you you went too. I did for three years. I was on a ketogenic diet. So, we should compare notes. Yeah. Um because I want to I want to hear your experience and then I want to ask you a couple questions about it.

[00:28:04] It was very hard. How long did you do it? Uh for a couple of years and I did not feel super healthy which is really kind of interesting. Um you know I I found it sort of socially isolating. I didn't did and so we you know we've worked actually to remedy this on we can talk about this later on on a novel keto keto um like a ketone or ketoester. Exactly. Of beta hydroxybutyrate. Um so going back to um the role of insulin um there is a lot happening in terms of you know that's been documented that the intensity so first your average glucose plays a role average blood glucose this is measured by hemoglobin A1C um in a whole series of complication cardiovascular as you know um but perhaps more important is the intensity of your peaks And uh and I think you know the intensity of the peaks of insulin is a reflection of your glucose intake fast absorbing glucose and that has been from that's the reason why we advocate advocate people to you know go on a CGM continuous glucose monitor and to really learn to understand what spikes them. The whole idea is to mitigate these peaks of insulin secretion.

[00:29:23] I'm just going to play this for all of our patients because we we have this discussion with every one of our patients. So it'll be nice to just play this video and let you do the talking. The whole idea there is to again to mitigate these peaks um and either dietary or you know for example the the GLP1 agonists are playing a role in this.

[00:29:45] Yeah. Well let's talk about this because there is at least for me a great deal of confusion around this point. Now we um we we understand today the role that the gut plays in metabolism and we understand that a lot of it is transduced through GLP1. So endogenous production of GLP-1 uh according to Ralph Def Franszo the world's authority on this is what's driving 80% of beta cell activity with respect to insulin and therefore when we have GLP when we have insulin resistance we can't the GLP1 we're making is insufficient to generate the insulin that's required to to to manage the glucose makes sense if that's the case that giving exogenous GLP1. You take a shot of tzepide or semiglutide, you're going to put more GLP-1 in the system. You're going to overcome the resistance at the beta cell. You make more insulin. You now have better glucose control. Everybody wins.

[00:30:51] Now, it's not clear that that has anything to do with the weight side of it and that that that's a separate issue and I want to actually talk about that because there are two very interesting theories as to why these things cause weight loss. But point here is, wouldn't you expect to see higher levels of insulin in someone taking a GLP-1 agonist to achieve that better glycemic control?

[00:31:13] Yes. And and that's not what you see. Um so I and I don't have an answer for this. Um but I' I've I've seen the same thing. I've seen the same thing. U including personally I've been experimenting with toatite. Uh my insulin is five now which is you know lowest that you can possibly get it. Um and I was expect I was there was a part of me that was worried that I was going to go against my my own whole theory about you know have you checked postprandially. Have you done an oral glucose tolerance test where you look at because that might be something to do um to see what is happening to postprandial um insulin along with postprandial glucose which of course will be better. No, I haven't.

[00:31:58] That that would be an interesting test to do. Yeah. And it I I've worn a CGM. Uh my A1C has gone from 5.4 5.5 to 5.0. Yep. And my insulin is down to 5.0 as well. So, and did you lose any weight? I lost a little bit of weight. Not a huge amount, six or seven pounds, which was never the goal not to start with. It was the whole idea was and and no loss of muscle mass which actually is the big uh the big um booaboo that you know people will have you fear no loss of muscle mass if you are exercising if you are so for me it's an experiment it's not I haven't decided this is something

[00:32:39] I'm going to continue but I just wanted to really experiment for myself to try to see okay what is this drug really doing and it's it's been nothing short of remarkable I think in some way um uh one of the most surprising has And for me, this feeling of satiety. Um, you know, you hear about satiety. I I was never in my whole life the type of person that felt full. I could always eat more. And and all of a sudden after about two weeks on this, I just looked at my plate. I said, I'm full. And I heard myself saying this and I just felt like, wow, this is really completely different. And for me, you know, the reason why I'm excited about these drugs is um, and by the way, this is not an endorsement. This is something to this.

[00:33:21] Yeah. Yeah. This is self-experimentation. Self experimentation which is a a long part of the tradition of our field which I I love and the whole idea is really to um for me the the thinking was one of the the biggest advance in longevity medicine is this idea that a range is meaningless. And and as a practicing phys physician you know this.

[00:33:47] You know, I went to medical school and we were told that, you know, your blood pressure has to be, you know, 130 over 90 and that was a normal range. So, you could be 128 over, you know, 88 and you were still considered normal. The same thing I went to see my personal physician and told him, you know, my blood sugar is creeping up every year that I'm doing it and now it's 96 fasting blood sugar and I'm worried because soon I'm going to be pregnant.

[00:34:12] And he said, it's below 100. It's okay. He told me, you're normal, don't worry. And I told him, I said, "What is normal?" And I think this is um this really is where I think longevity medicine is going to make an important impact is really sort of revisit. I I can't tell you how many times I've had this argument with people about glucose. Um and there and and here's the funny thing. We have the literature, in other words, we have literature in non-diabetics, your A1C that says the lower the A1C, the lower the all-c cause mortality. It's a monotonic reduction that knows no lower limit.

[00:34:48] I'm with you. So, so we say that up to 5.6 is normal. And if you're at 5.6, you're fine. And 5, but but 5.5 is better than 5.6. And 5.4 is better than 5.5. And five is better than 5.4. And 4.8 is better than 5.1. I'm not there yet. Yeah. Yeah. But my point is, uh, I also find it um I don't know what the word is. Maybe sad. I find it sad that we've we've simplified this problem uh in in an effort to to communicate but have lost the essence of where where is lower better uh because it's not always true in biology right it's not you know when you look at TSH for example when you look at thyroid hormone much more narrow band in which we would say there's optimal um and lower is not you know if it's too low or too high it's problematic but it turns out that when it comes to average blood glucose in you know, non-type type 1 diabetic or someone who's taking insulin. Um, under natural physiological circumstances, it's it's just better to be lower. Um, and as you age, it just keeps creeping up.

[00:35:52] Same thing for blood pressure. Yes. You know, they're they're revisiting the number every 5 years in terms of making it lower. You know, I think if your blood pressure is a 105 over 65, you're better off than if you're 115 over 70. That's right. Provided you're not symptomatic, lower is always better. And so I think it's um uh you know I'm frustrated but I'm also excited by the fact that this is now becoming uh the norm in a whole new field of physicians who are more aware of what what actually what is health and and the same for your weight. You know we know that it's a J I mean that's the thing that I is really interesting in the whole aging field is this idea that everything is a J curve.

[00:36:35] So there there's um there's a sweet spot where you want to be and quite often it's broad enough that you can maneuver this in a way to optimize people's health. What do you think is the relationship between I mean body weight is so crude but maybe we can even talk about it through atyposity body fat and and longevity uh once correcting for metabolic health.

[00:36:57] So, it's it's obvious that so much of the relationship we see between body fat and poor health is really just a proxy for something that's harder to measure, which is metabolic health. It's very easy to measure body fat. And we estimate body fat from BMI. And so, that's why we have all these population data from BMI. But as if you have the luxury of working with actual patients, you you I don't know. I couldn't tell you the BMI of one person I take care of, but I know everybody's body fat, everybody's visceral fat, and everybody's oral glucose tolerance test.

[00:37:27] So we we we know what we what we know and we know what matters. Um are you convinced that atyposity per se is problematic or do you believe that a person can have excess body fat but be metabolically healthy and confer the same longevity benefit as a metabolically healthy lean person? I mean we know there are people who are o considered overweight who are metabolically healthy.

[00:37:58] Yes. Um I mean easily 20% in my experience. Yes. And I am not where I I think it that's these are facts. No one can dispute them. You can be overweight and metabolically healthy. What I worry about is that is the long-term effect. Do you mean from an orthopedic perspective? with the other complications that come from excess weight or are you saying that that they're basically increasing their probability of eventually going off the metabolic slide?

[00:38:28] Both. M I I I and I honestly I don't know what the data says but uh my worry would be that you might be metabolically looking healthy when you're 40 but if you sustain this for 20 years you know clearly visceral fat yeah different category is highly predictive of everything u the other thing I'll say also the BMI itself is a is a my BMI is at the border of being overweight

[00:38:55] I am overweight by BMI I think I'm four by four pounds If I if I lost four pounds, I would get down to a BMI of 25. And I have 11% body fat. So I I I don't worry about it because I know, you know, all in all, I'm metabolically healthy. My numbers are good and all this. So in some way, yes, it's it's it's not a particularly helpful I mean, it serves its purpose at the population level, but it it can't be used to make a decision about an individual at all.

[00:39:21] Exactly. But it can also sometimes you know become a confounding variables when people do studies and they use these numbers and they they make predictions or they draw conclusions that are really not based on the fact that that high BMI fraction of the population is heterogeneous in terms of metabolic health. I think this is really where um so my colleagues at the buck uh Nathan

[00:39:45] Price and Lee Hood have actually published a paper. Wait, I didn't realize they were at the Buck. Yeah, both of them. They were up in Seattle before, weren't they? Yes, we recruited both of them actually in the last two years. Congratulations. Yeah, thank you. I think this is transformative for us. Fantastic. Very exciting.

[00:40:00] Um Lee U is still partially in Seattle, so he's partially at the buck, but he's brought you know, we we've established a collaboration with Phenom Health and Nathan was at Thorne and still a cso at Thorne, but a fac full, you know, faculty member at the back. So I think it and they're really helping us to do something really exciting along these lines. For example, they they had a paper describing this um uh uh uh BMI but bio biochemical BMI based on biological markers that essentially assess you know your metabolic status.

[00:40:36] So I think that's you know those tools are are available and it's a question of educating the physician. And do you know what makes up that biological BMI? No, but I I'll give you the paper. So, okay, we spent a little more time on metabolism than we did immune uh health and the immune system overall. I'd actually like to go back and talk about it a little bit more. Um I think again the listeners of this podcast are very familiar with the metabolic stuff. We haven't had as many discussions on the immune system. Um talked about it at length uh with respect to cancer. Uh had

[00:41:12] Steve Rosenberg on a few years ago. That was a fantastic discussion explaining the role of the immune system in cancer, which I think we're going to have to talk about here because I mean, I certainly feel convinced that a big part of why cancer incidence goes up uh exponentially with age is the declining immune system, not just the accumulation of mutations, although I I imagine they both play a role. Um, but I will tell you something else, Eric, which is uh, you know, I wrote a book a couple of years ago about this space. And in the book, I talk about these things called the four horsemen. And I described them as the the four things that are basically coming for us all. If you out if you manage to outlive youth, right?

[00:41:53] So if you're, you know, this is not to diminish the role of trauma and other things that are that are that are that are deadly. But but for many people living in OECD nations, it's going to come down to ASCVD, cancer, dementing and neurodeenerative diseases and metabolic diseases. And people often say, Peter, is there anything you wish you'd written in the book that you would if you go back in time you would do? And

[00:42:15] I say, yeah, there there are probably many things if I thought about it, but the first thing that jumps out is I really should have added a fifth horseman. and that is immune health and the types of infections that ravage people in old age that a young person wouldn't even laugh at or would laugh at. Right. So, thank you for bringing this up because we you know the imunology field somewhat um immunology and aging have been uh not really mixing very well. One one problem is that imunology is an extremely complex and advanced field probably one of the along with neuroscience one of the most complex. Um so when you go to an aging meeting there is no one talking about imunology. You go to imunology meeting there are very few people talking about aging. Um and we try to navigate even the nomenclature is is being used differently. You know people in in imunology talk about imunosiness meaning aging of the immune system. They don't mean scinessence the way we talk about it in the aging field. Interesting. So that yields all kinds of crazy communication problems.

[00:43:21] Yeah. Because if you're in the aging field then you hear immunosiness you think of SASPs and things that are being secreted by te- cells. It just means aging of the immune system. Um now the reason why I think this is u a tragic failing for for both field is what happened during covid. It was became obvious that you know being infected was not you know your risk of infection was not linked to your age.

[00:43:47] The virus infected everyone across but the outcome could be completely different with 84 excess 84fold excess mortality if you were above 75. 84fold. Now you know when this happened um and we can go in in terms of trying to understand why why did this happen? what are the the reasons for this? Um I I went and started to look at the literature. Um influenza, it's exactly the same thing. RSV, same thing. So all of these viruses that are, you know, that you can contract in later years will kill you, you know, with really significant rates. You know, influenza,

[00:44:25] I think 30,000 people die every year from influenza. um you know the mortality in terms of um uh COVID was really highly segregated into the older part of the population or in that part of the population that showed accelerated aging, obesity and so on. So I think there's a there's a lot there. Do you think that that most of the um mortality any any time we saw a gap in mortality whether it was young versus old whether it was obese versus non-obese diabetic versus non-diabetic cuz we're any anytime you looked at that you saw a difference in mortality do you believe that it was always a difference in immune function I mean with young versus old it's very obvious but do you think that was also true in the other coorbidities?

[00:45:09] Yes. Yeah. would say so and it it comes from two two reasons. One is you know there are two broad immune system the what we call the innate and the adaptive immune system. I don't know if you want me to I would I actually was going to say I think it is worth going full boore on this. I think it is time for people to roll up their sleeves and understand arguably the most interesting system in the human body. I am biased. I I spent two years at the NCI doing immunology, but I think this is such an interesting field.

[00:45:40] Yeah. So, our immune system is is built to recognize foreign elements. That's really is why it evolved. It has two lines of defense against microbes, bacteria, viruses, fungi, all of those. We are constantly bombarded by those. It is actually amazing because I mean the evidence of this is if your immune system doesn't function, the bubble compatible with life compatible with life. So we are u you know we're colonized with bacteria in and out on our skins everywhere. So we constantly respond to them in an appropriate manner and we survive everything including disruptions to the barriers.

[00:46:19] Absolutely. Absolutely. And so we have two lines of defense in the immune system. First the so-called innate immune system which is your macrofasages your dendritic cells but also pretty much every cell has a whole series of mechanism that are uh not pathogen specific that is they will recognize an intruder be it a virus be it a fungi be it bacteria and they will activate a first line of defense. those line of defenses are non-specific and therefore they're less effective um and they give time to the so-called adaptive immune system which is the second part which is made up of T- cells and B cells and both of those cells have highly selective defense mechanism the B cells make antibodies which will go uh recognize a bacteria or or a fungus or or a virus and and and the tea cells which are able to actually kill the infected self itself. So it will recognize when the cell is colonized by a foreign uh pathogen and will uh will kill it. Um so the you know the time course of these is that you know once you get you encounter a pathogen you will be activate your innate immune response.

[00:47:41] Typically you know it can be fever it can be all kinds of symptoms but activation of this defense and this gives the whole organism a couple of weeks to actually build the defense for the specific uh that will specifically recognize this organism. Um let's talk a little bit let's talk a little bit about memory within that system.

[00:48:01] The the beauty of the adaptive so the DNA immune system does not really have a me a true memory. It will always react in the same way no matter how many times you you you encounter the so the same you get if you if you get the same vir so if your if your kids are pingponging the same respiratory virus at you from school yes your innate immune system has the same playbook. Yes.

[00:48:23] Fever. Uh you're going to get red. You're going to like whatever inflamation. Yeah. You're going to get sore. All of those things are going to happen regardless. Exactly. Yeah. Um and that's in contrast to the adaptive immune system because once the initial response has been generated either via an infection or a vaccination, this is what a vaccination is. It presents you with a given fra fraction or the whole virus or a part of it. your body will mount a response and this will yield um this will lead to the amplification of a subset of cells that are selective. So think about your either your T- cells or your B cells none of them are the same.

[00:49:04] We have a process by which we generate so-called diversity which is um billions of different forms of antibodies or T- cell receptors that are recognizing in principle every chemical structure or every protein from from a microorganism. Now what happens during the initial encounter either be a vaccination or an infection is those B cells or those T- cells that have a receptor that is able to recognize the pathogen will become amplified and they will turn out large amount of the antibbody or or or the T- cell clones once the job has been done they will contract but it will not contract back down to the same level, they will become what we call memory T cells or memory B cells. So that if you encounter the same antigen in the future, the reactivation process is shortened, the maturation happens faster. So eventually that's the whole idea of the vaccination is to sort of get yourself ready with a a subset of memory T- cell clones or B cell clones that once the the true uh virus will come you will be able to mount a response within a few days or or up to a week. And so that's how vaccination works. Now what's interesting during aging is and people are not aware of this uh if you're above 70 uh most vaccinations do not work and so people then will ask they actually your immune system has aged and your vaccination rate really decreases very strongly from what I remember this might be different in different populations but the vaccination rate success is close to 30% if you're above 70 now what would during COVID. What was the risk reduction for a person over 75 who was vaccinated versus not vaccinated? Oh, it was almost complete reversal of of the effect in terms of the protection, meaning it was highly highly protective.

[00:51:13] Yeah, it was it was protective. So, how how do we reconcile those two facts? That's true. Um, and I don't know to be honest, I don't know how this has been studied. Um I don't know. Uh I I I would be happy to to to read about this. Okay. How because the COVID vaccine seems to have had a remarkable risk reduction in very old people. Didn't didn't seem to have an impressive risk reduction in younger people. Uh because the absolute risk was so low, it didn't seem to matter that much. But boy did it matter in older people. But did it matter by at the population level or at the individual level? This is what I'm not sure about.

[00:51:59] I don't I I certainly don't want to go on record saying something that I don't but my recollection Yeah. I mean we we you know I I think we can find the answer and put it in the show notes. My recollection uh which could be wrong is that the older a person got the greater the benefit they got from co vaccines. um with respect to mortality. Um so I guess the question is let's maybe talk about other vaccines. Is that not the case with influenza? Is that not the case with Numacus or any of the other vaccines that are used primarily in older adults in in general? um at least and I'm not a a vaccine specialist but uh the the thinking is that um there's a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of vaccination against influenza against

[00:52:54] RSV against all of those as you age. Um the thinking then is how how does it work at the population level and this is where the whole concept of her immunity uh works is that if you limit the spread of the infection in a family for example you're le much less likely to infect grandpa who who is you know who will

[00:53:13] I see I see so that that's been my understanding of how most of these viruses u these yeah I'm asking a different question that's an important question I guess I was asking the obviously they didn't probably do a randomized control trial. So you've got all these confounders in it, but I wonder if they just looked at all comers to the hospital, vaccinated versus non, let's try to control for all the confounders. If the hazard ratio is 1.2, it means nothing or eight. But if the hazard ratio was, you know, 0.2 or eight, well, you'd say even with the confounders, there must be some high degree of protection that came from that. Uh, so anyway, I'm sure someone listening to this knows the answer to that. We'll try to find the answer and put it in the show notes. But, um, so let's go back to the why, right? Why is it that as a person ages, they're less likely to respond to a vaccination? Is it because a their immune system, the adaptive immune system is less able to recognize the foreign pathogen and build up a high enough reserve of T- cells and

[00:54:21] B cells that will respond? or is it B that they can do that but the ability for those cells to stay in a memory state and be reactivated is somehow impaired. I think it's both uh as in everything in aging aging is um but there's one aspect which is uh really unique at least in terms of T- cell which are really instrumental in terms of most vaccine response is the fact that these TE cells are generated by the thymus and the thymus uh a small organ behind the the sternum.

[00:54:59] How big is your thymus and my thymus right now? I don't I I'm 68 so it's probably very very embionic and there's probably not much left. So after age 50 in most people you find it um very small. Now the the whereas it when you're young it's a it's actually you can see it on an imaging study and I I would imagine if you and I had a CT scan of the chest you'd barely be able to pick it up.

[00:55:23] Exactly. And it's replaced by fat actually in most people as you age. Um although there is some somewhat controversial evidence that there might still be some clones that can be reactivated even in older people and and human growth hormone as you know is one of the the the the intervention that has been shown to actually reinduce thyogenesis.

[00:55:46] So let's let's talk about that a little bit. Are you referring to that fee paper from about seven or eight years ago that looked at growth hormone with metformin and DHEA or something like that? That's one. But that fee paper was actually um inspired by work of a colleague of mine when I was at the Glatstone Institute um who um uh did this actually Mike McHugh and colleagues did this in patients with

[00:56:13] HIV uh who are chronically infected with HIV where they lose a lot of their CD4T cells and there was an interest in trying to see if you could actually and so there's a big lesion initially in infection And there was um uh an attempt to actually try to see if you could regenerate these populations to bring them back to a normal because even though we had great drugs against HIV, they could not bring those patients back to normal. There was a remaining sort of original insult. So they did a trial u uh with uh human growth hormone that were able to show some degree of uh thyogenesis and and increase in naive tea cells in in these patients and I believe the fee trial u actually tried to reproduce this. I think there's a second fee trial that is ongoing or but

[00:57:06] I haven't seen the results. Yeah, I mean the first one was I I don't remember the results, but the cocktail was a little suspect. So the GH made sense if that's your hypothesis. I believe I've never spoken with Greg, but I believe reading the trial. The metformin, which was really given at a homeopathic useless dose, I think it was only given at 500, so apologies if it wasn't, but I think it was only given at 500, was meant to offset the glucose metabolism disturbances of GH. Do you remember why the DHEA was given?

[00:57:41] No, there was some reason for it that uh made sense on paper but didn't make sense sort of physiologically. Now the more important question is if if my my take on that trial was it was a single active agent which was growth hormone like I don't think DHEA does anything. I don't think 500 metformin does anything. So the question is and it was a very small trial and I think it was open label and I have I have a significant problem with the readout of that that trial.

[00:58:08] So that's what I want to ask you about. Remind me of the readout. The readout was uh one of the clocks. Ah that's right. This was Steve Horvath was the other author on that. Exactly. and and um and actually this is this whole story sort of pushed us into a whole project that we've published down on on what we call entry clock um because there was indeed in the experiment um they in the patients they indeed observed some increase in na in the fraction of naive tea cells which tells you and me that something worked the fraction of naive tea cells increased um with respect to the memory tea cells, the naive tea cells are the ones that are generated in the thymus.

[00:58:54] They are they're naive because they have never met their cognate antigen and they sit there waiting for something to happen. So the whole idea of treating with human growth hormone was to induce thyogenesis and to restore the pool of these naive tea cells. So I think to some degree it worked at low level. uh then they used the clock uh on the whole blood and my worry uh when I saw the paper which is a worry that actually existed predated this u was also a worry when people were using tome tie length is the idea when you sample the blood as an iminologist I know this is a highly dynamic uh organ think about the blood as an organ we enumerate at this point today with the best technology more than 500 different populations of cells in the blood. Suppose that these cells vary in response to any intervention and that these cells individually have a different epigenetic age. You would have the impression that you are rejuvenating, you know, which is was the claim of that fee paper that they had rejuvenated people. But in effect, what you would do is simply change.

[01:00:05] Yeah. It's like you're on a sine wave that goes like this and you take two sample points. They could be here. They could be here. They could be here. You don't. And by the way, as you probably know, Matt Camberlin has famously purchased, I think, four or five of the commercially available aging clocks.

[01:00:22] He bought them in duplicate and did all of them, sampled them all simultaneously. Right? So, two of this, two of this, two of this, two of this simultaneously. Take 10 samples. And not only do all the clocks disagree with each other, but even within the same clock, there was disagreement. significant disagreement. Um, so yeah, I mean I want to actually come back and talk about clocks in in some detail, but given that that study was done years ago with an older clock, I I think the clock part of it is not even remotely interesting. I think the more interesting question is was there was there genuine thyic regeneration? If so, how do we reconcile a very pressing and vexing question within neuroscience, which is the role of growth hormone? Right? So, I've never taken growth hormone. I've never I shouldn't say I've never prescribed it.

[01:01:13] I've prescribed it in very rare circumstances for injury uh healing. Um but I've never prescribed it for quote unquote longevity benefits. But a lot of people are out there doing so. And as such, I've had lots of patients who come to my practice who have been taking or are on growth hormone. And I will say this to a person, every single one of them has said, "I feel so much better when I take growth hormone than when I do not." I mean, across the board, 100%.

[01:01:43] And I can't actually point to evidence that tells them it's bad to take. I can just sort of say it doesn't make sense to take if our goal is to reduce the risk of cancer and if our goal is to slow the aging process. Um so what is your take on that? Just just your intuition uh or is there any data you're aware of that would would lead one to think that well maybe we could pulse a little bit of growth hormone here and there if we get some thymic regeneration. We don't have to be on it all the time. I mean how would you think about that? I do worry about it for I'm not a specialist on growth hormone itself. Um it induces diabetes.

[01:02:25] It induces glucose intolerance. So from that angle I'm do worry about what it would do chronically especially in someone young. For me I really it's a bit like uh increasing your protein intake. um if you are you know there's a clear evidence that increasing your protein intake especially as you age becomes beneficial and the people who have higher protein intake um uh actually do better in terms of muscle mass and so on. So in someone uh who is 65 to 70 who is starting to feel you know uh the effect of or manifest some form of psychopenia there might be a benefit for that person to actually increase muscular mass and and all the benefits with this especially if it's not done continuously but but I mean I would argue there's no doubt that there's benefits but you're going to get far more efficacy from testosterone or anabolic steroids when it comes comes to mitigating sarcopenia.

[01:03:25] Growth hormone actually is not remarkable at inducing muscle mass. It's nowhere near as effective um as testosterone. It's more effective at um eliciting fat loss. But I wonder if there's something that goes beyond that because I I think when when people tell me they feel better on it, I think they're talking about like less aches and pains. Like just joints just feel better. I don't think anybody's saying they feel better because their thymus is more plump, but I wonder if like that to me would be a reason to potentially consider a schedule, you know, an intermittent schedule of something if it's again going back to my macro thesis here, which is I've been harping on these four horsemen, four horsemen.

[01:04:08] Well, if we introduce a fifth horsemen, what is the strategy? because I can give you chapter in verse the strategy for how you will mitigate heart disease, cancer, all of these other conditions. What is our strategy for mitigating immune decline? I would say the same as as a strategy that would mitigate decline in every other organ, you know, and there's clear evidence that people ex the effect of exercise on on on immunology is the same as in every single

[01:04:37] So, I'm not familiar with it. So, tell tell me a little bit about that. I don't know specifically how how exercise impacts the immune system. I don't know that you know I cannot speak to specific papers but I mean clearly um there's evidence that people who exercise actually respond to infection better uh you know respond to vaccination better. So that that's all been documented. I cannot speak to the specific studies but there is do you have a sense of mechanistically why that's the case? It is so complex I would say I I would not be able to to tell you. But that being said,

[01:05:11] I think the whole the whole line of investigation to induce uh uh thyic uh uh rejuvenation I think is an important one area especially if we thinking about increasing lifespan you know further for what we are doing now that in the future it will become one of these rate limiting step. It's a bit the same situation as the ovary where you know these are the ovary and the and the thymus are we call them the canary and the coal mine. I mean there really are specific organs that show accelerate aging way earlier than than other than other tissues. Now the question is you know why is the thymic involuting so early? Um I think it's probably because evolutionary we were never meant to live this old and um and and so that that really is one of the thinking that that goes on that's going to be in the long term one of the problems that we have to face and and this is something we're actively studying in the lab is trying to we just completed a study uh where we are looking for novel biomarkers that are predictive of whether you will respond to a vaccination or not and this is something done in collaboration Mark

[01:06:20] Davis at Stanford using the 10,00 immunome project which is one of the largest studies studying aging in the immune system only only in humans and and so we've been able to uh studying people to identify some metabolites that are associated with poor response to vaccine and so those are not only markers but they could also become uh tools that we include in as aduvent or as a as a pre pre-treatment theory I'm sure you're familiar with the the work of Joan Manik Of course. Yeah, I was going to ask you about manic and click scene in a moment, but before we do, I want to go back to this point here, which is um you know, biomarkers are so important.

[01:07:02] And when I think about cardiovascular disease, uh and even though it's the leading cause of death, why I tell my patients it's the one you need to be least afraid of if you're willing to be proactive in management. And it comes down to the fact that we just have such a clear understanding of how the disease works and we have exceptional biomarkers, right? So we we can measure the things that are causing the disease.

[01:07:28] We can measure inflammation. We can measure apo. We can measure VLDLDL cholesterol, LP little A. We also we can measure blood pressure. We can measure metabolic health. And we know how to address those things. And we know that when we address those things, we can measure whether what we're doing is working. Okay, so problem solved basically. Um, when it comes to the immune system, let's we're going to talk about Manic and Clickstein in a moment. But as we saw from their paper 10 years ago, um they gave a rapamy analog to people uh people who were in their 60s, vaccinated them and demonstrated that oh boy, you got a much better immune response. Okay, they were able to demonstrate that using laboratory techniques. I'm sure they used flowcytometry or something like that to measure it. Um, how close are we to being able to do that sort of thing commercially?

[01:08:27] By commercially I mean uh over the counter like uh not close I think in in that study they actually measured antibbody tighters. So even more complicated than flowcytometry. Yes. Okay. And so um in that case they definitely showed an enhancing effect with a a known uh you know juror protector. This was a suspected jur protector at least in humans. We exactly a rapid log and they showed uh not only um increased tighters but also protection increased protection.

[01:09:03] Eventually the the clinical trial failed for a whole series of other reasons which were in part due to the way that the the the FDA imposed the trial to be generated. I think it just complicated the whole picture. Yeah. By the way, for folks listening to us who are confused by that, um Matt Camberlin and I had a specific discussion because it wasn't the 2014 trial. It was a later trial where they it wasn't the RAD 001 trial. It was the

[01:09:33] It was the other trial that failed. Uh and I actually don't remember the reason, but but Matt Matt explained it. It was very clear that it was a tragedy of bureaucracy. It is. And um and it shouldn't be viewed as a black eye on that molecule. Yeah. And u I think you know Matt is more of a specialist in the whole rappering. So we'll defer to what he said, but we'll we'll link in the show notes to where that to to where Matt and I had that discussion.

[01:10:00] Yeah. my inter my what I've heard from anyone that I've talked to including Joan is that this was uh in some way bungled which which is sad because sometimes things like this can put a field back for you know a number of years and discourage investors. We have a um a startup that originated at the buckle which has raised $50 million again coming up with rapologues novel rapaloges that are going to be I think revisiting that whole that whole picture. Uh, so we're quite excited. The field is is far from being dead.

[01:10:32] Will we ever be able to measure this in people the way we measure hemoglobin A1C or things like that? Or is it going to be one of those things where it's a bit of a leap of faith and you're going to have to look at the clinical trial where the outcome was there? And then you're just going to have to say, well, even though there was probably massive heterogeneity amongst the participants in the trial, we're going to dose this thing individually. I mean, it's a little bit like, you know, you brought up vitamin D earlier. I mean, one of the problems with the vitamin D trials is that they're all garbage, right? Because they all just give people a given dose.

[01:11:05] They don't measure the response. They don't measure compliance. A vitamin D trial should be done based on target level, not target dose. And so we we run the risk here of the same thing in a much more complicated system. Agree. Uh that being said, measuring pathogen specific titers is done routinely in the clinic by you know I I don't know if you did this but I just had my uh measles tighter measured because I'm I'm was born in 1957 which is right the age at which before 1957 everyone was um exposed to measles. So you are typically uh safe and but you should measure your tighter to determine whether you need to be revaccinated and uh and I I found out that yeah you can do this very easily. You get a tighter would the tighters by themselves tell you? So what would you predict? So if if

[01:12:02] I if I measured every tighter right now, if I measured polio, shingles, did a pan tighter on you and then started you on rapamy for eight weeks and then stopped it and then reme-measured your titers without vaccinating you, what would you expect to see? I would not expect them to change. Yeah, exactly. So how do we know we're improving your immune system if indeed we have?

[01:12:26] Oh, you or I see what you're saying. So in terms of uh if we were to start you on rapamy what would happen? So how could we measure the improvement in immune function? By the way the uh the manic trial showed that when you vac you first they did a a one month treatment with the rapidog before vaccination. So this was uh they demonstrated not an effect on existing vaccination but only demonstrated on denovo vaccination. And I think um you know what would be the effect on existing titers against all of the other pathogen? I don't know. I mean I don't think this have ever been done.

[01:13:07] Yeah. Interesting. Um let you want to just say a little bit more about that trial. So that was at least for me a that was that was a very pivotal moment in my journey in this uh uh in this space and in understanding this world. So that was December of 2014 that that paper came out and uh if I recall roughly 300 plus participants divided into four groups. So placebo group, a group that got 1 milligram every day, a group that got 5 milligrams once a week and a group that got 20 milligrams once a week. Uh so two two people were pulsed uh one much higher than the other and then one given daily and then a placebo.

[01:13:45] I believe they were all over 65. I think the study was done in Australia and as you said they were um put on their whatever treatment was for four weeks immunized I think it was another four weeks and then a six week wash out and then the titers were checked and the best response I think was in the 5 mgram pulse and the 20 milligram pulse. The 1 milligram daily still had a better response than the placebo but not as strong as the two pulse doses. But the five and the 20 weekly were nearly identical, but the 20 had much more side effects. So I think that and again I I don't remember perfectly, so correct me if I'm wrong pretty well. Uh the takeaway was basically 5 milligram pulse was the sweet spot. You get all the benefit without the side effects.

[01:14:34] Reason why No, I I think that's that's how I remember that trial as well. Although I'm I'm always impressed by how you remember the all of the details of these clinical trials. Uh what was remarkable about that data was the fact that um this is from a drug that is supposed to be an immune suppressant immunosuppressant and you know it's been a long road for the longevity field to try to get our colleagues who are actually using uh rapamy as an imunosuppressant to have to to have them believe that um this actually has an effect on immunity and not only not imunosuppress suppressive but actually promoting immunity. So how do you reconcile that?

[01:15:15] Uh meaning not not not not their disbelief which is warranted but how do you reconcile that one molecule can be if if given so if you think about the doses we used to give rapamy it's not actually used that much by the way um today in um in in in the in the uh transplant clinic. Uh so so FK506 uh Cerolamus has largely pardon me um uh no no no I'm blanking on what FK506's real name is but anyway whatever it's it's largely displaced uh seramus which is RAPA but that said when we used to give it out we were giving 2 to four milligrams a day.

[01:15:55] Yeah. Now let's just assume that it was indeed contributing to prevention of organ rejection. Do you think it was doing so because that's a high enough dose of constitutively giving a drug that it suppresses the immune system or do you think it was only suppressing the immune system because it was given being it was being given in combination with two other drugs and it was only as part of that sea of other drugs that it has the imunosuppressive effects. No, I I think there's clear evidence it is imunosuppressive by itself and I can tell you that for the period when I was on rapamy um I would take either four or six milligrams a week every morning. So once a week so that the biggest difference between the two you know the imunosuppressive and the sort of gerrotective effect is really the amount the frequency and the amount.

[01:16:47] Um the reason why people adopted this sort of once weekly dose is to f first not have any imunosuppression and second to mitigate the secondary effect which are thought to be caused by uh inhibition of mtor torque 2 which is the second complex yeah the glucose effect and that seems to be working largely. Um what was uh in my case remarkable is that every time I took my dose not two I did only did two for a couple of weeks but either four or six the next morning

[01:17:18] I would have a pimple on my nose. So I was immunosuppressed clearly uh every single time. For a day. Yeah. For a day. For a day or two. And you know I sort of made peace with it in the fact that if I had a really heavy workout I would have exactly the same thing. Exercise is imunosuppressive. if you if you if you go all out, you know, you can get a cold, you can you know, you're temporarily fragilized after a really heavy exercise. So I think um the the difference really between these these these two these two world of imunosuppression which clearly has been documented by clinical trials it is imunosuppressive by itself uh versus the beneficial effect on the immune system to me is a question of dosage and frequency and yet I cannot reconcile the unambiguous success of the interventions testing program where those mice were eating rapamy in every single bite of food they took. In fact, they were consuming it more continuously than even the most immune compromised patient. And without exception, every single ITP study of rapamy, whether they started in old mice or young mice, RAPA alone, RAPA with another drug, it just doesn't matter. It always worked. How do we reconcile that? I I we do have well I don't have the answer but I can I can sort of uh talk about it in a way I just there's something that worries me about our reliance on the mouse as a model system um uh for aging for studying aging and how relevant it is to us as as species even mice that are of the qual I mean because we would all admit that the ITP mice are the best they're the Ferrari of mice. Exactly. The ITP is the best because uh is the best way to address this question uh because they're using mice that are you know cross so it's not in not inbred when you're using black six you're essentially doing the experiment on N of one and the whole world I mean 80% of the work that's being done in mice is done on on black six this is we're all studying the same person um so obviously when you go and try to transfer this to a human population with all of it variation. So the ITP did the right thing. That being said, and this is not an attack on ITP. I think ITP is a great program and should be funded and we should continue to study this. I just worry about the over reliance on ITP alone. And I think we should have another system that studies um uh primate interventions with drugs. There are a number of primates, non-human primates that are actually much closer to us. The reason I worry about mouse is is something that actually Steve Astart

[01:20:10] U that you've had on on this podcast as well. Steve is a good friend and he came up with something called the longevity quotient which I think is a something that people do not pay attention enough. So longevity quotient is this idea that um if you look across the animal kingdom the larger you are the longer you live.

[01:20:32] Okay? So you can take thousand species and you can weigh you know you on on the x- axis you have their their size on a y-axis their um their life expectancy it largely rises to the right and you can see a monotonous curve now there are exceptions to this um one of them is um naked mole yeah naked mole rats y for example uh naked mole rats you know are living way above. So they live above they punch above their weight. Dogs tend to punch below their weight.

[01:21:07] Exactly. Although in dogs it again varies by within the size thing it seems between species. Then when you look intra species it gets even more complicated which is the larger dog lives shorter than the smaller dogs the great dane versus the Chihuahua. That is done actually that's driven mostly by growth hormone which is again another another reason why we should look at you know taking growth hormone as an anti-aging drug with some degree of circumspection because uh in dogs the more growth hormone you have the larger you are and the shorter you live. We know also in humans the the larger you are the taller you are the shorter you live. So are these effect of growth hormone? Yes. Are they only important while during the growth phase? That that's a possibility, but it's something that really gives me pause to go back to our discussion about growth hormone. Now, where was I? I sort of lost my ch.

[01:22:00] You're still trying to make the argument for why ITP mice given rapamy with every bite of food somehow live longer. So, u again going back to respiratory quot the the longevity quotient, um mice are also an exception. they punch below their their weight. So they live shorter than they should based on so on their you know on their size and humans is the biggest exception. We live about six five to six times longer than we should uh based on our size which tells me that um you know we aren't a naked mole rat of primates. We do incredibly well which means that we already have optimized a lot of these pathways that are you know promoting aging. I suspect the mice is exactly the opposite. I I don't know that someone has really compared sort of intrinsic to to activity in mice. Are they for example living in and you know mice are especially laboratory mice are engineered to reproduce and and grow as quickly as possible. They have large litter size. They do everything very quickly. Now we know all of these activities are requiring a lot of anabolic uh you know strength which is driven by to. So the question is are the mice sort of examples of animals that are maximizing to activity to do everything they do very quickly and we are maybe at the other end of the spectrum where we have low sort of uh basal to activity. So that's where I worry when you know people just transfer everything we know from to mice into humans is saying it's going to show and work in humans. I don't know if you heard such an interesting point.

[01:23:40] Yeah. So I think this is and this is frankly why I stopped taking rapamy. I thought you know um I did not really see anything in terms of anything uh metabolically, physically, muscle strength. I could not you know in contrast to GLP1 agonist where I saw all of my numbers get better um and functionally strength all of this. I saw everything getting better on GLP agonist with rapamy I never could could tell whether I was taking it or not.

[01:24:09] Yeah. Although look and of well it's not just that I would say where rapamy acts I don't know that we would see anything getting significantly better right because if we think that the main places that rapamy is is going to act would be on uh autophagy. Well there's no way you're going to measure autophagy.

[01:24:31] You're not going to feel autophagy. You're not going to see it or measure it. Um, does it tamp down on certain subsets of scinesscent cells? That that's certainly plausible. Again, I don't know how we're going to see or measure or necessarily even feel that. Um, does it reduce some of the tonic lowgrade unhelpful inflammation?

[01:24:52] Probably. But again, if a person doesn't have much to begin with, it's going to be tough to measure. Conversely, GLP-1 agonists act directly on a thing that is so easy to measure, which is glucose metabolism and body weight for those who are losing weight as well. So, so it might not be a fair comparison. I guess the other thing I would add to this interesting observation is that of course the mice in the ITP are still in a relatively sterile environment and it might be that even if they incur some immunosuppression it's not going to be as maladaptive as it would be if they were wild animals as we are live in a sterile environment. They live grouped in a cage with no ability to move to exercise. They are uh they eat a diet which uh makes the American diet look like the most healthy thing ever. I mean, have you ever seen the pellets that these mice are eating?

[01:25:50] Do the ITP mice eat the crappy pellets as well? I suspect they're eating Okay. I don't I don't actually know what their diet is. Yeah, I don't know what their diet is, but I mean there are not that many. I can guarantee you they're not eating salads and and and fruits and and vegetables. So in some way they are an incredibly artificially bad uh you know sort of environment.

[01:26:13] The these mice actually doing everything that is conducive to a poor health and and so the fact that we see something that works in that system might have some value for you know the fraction of the population that has a very poor lifestyle. But I I do worry about you know transferring this to someone uh like you and I who are exercising or trying to eat well or trying to sleep and and and all of this. So I I I I take these observations with some degree of caution and and and frankly I you know I when people ask me should I go on rapamy I do worry um now this is a different you know it's very different story if someone a patient comes and sees sees you at 40 years old and tells you I think I I want to go and rap a mison I would strongly argue that this you should not do this because even in the in the studies that have been conducted they still saw an effect in mice that were the equivalent of 65 to 70 years old. Now if you're 75 years old and you have the feeling you're u you you know you're chronically inflamed and you have the feeling that things are not doing well um there are a number of anecdotal cases where people have described really feeling a lot better and a lot stronger very quickly uh on rapamy on rapamy but I would predict it would be the same thing with a growth hormone or some of these interventions. So, I've really put those in different categories and I my argument to people is um today we have one intervention that is very profoundly anti-aging um and it is physical activity exercise in all of its forms and uh once you have optimized this I think let's talk about doing something else on top of that.

[01:27:52] So earlier you brought up the certuan story in NAD I'd love to spend a little bit of time there. Um, I was at a talk recently and as always I get asked questions about stuff like that and I got asked the the question about NAD and I said look this is one of those things where if I tell you the following facts I'm going to tell you three facts.

[01:28:17] NAD is completely ubiquitous throughout the body and um it is absolutely essential for the most important chemical reactions that happen in the body. You cannot undergo redux reactions, metabolic reactions without NAD. Um that is that is point one. Point two is a class of proteins called certuins rely heavily on NAD as the substrate in the process of repairing DNA. That is fact two. Fact three is as you age NAD levels decline precipitously.

[01:28:59] Okay, those are three facts and I don't believe is there any dispute to any of those facts? No controversy. Okay, armed with those three facts, how could it be that supplementing NAD does not lead to a longer better life or some health benefit? Um, that's a logical conclusion right now. Well, not completely because uh you are assuming you know it it depends also what is the reason why NAD levels decrease.

[01:29:32] Yes. And it depends also what supplements how do you remedy this this is something I'd love to talk about CD38 and and some of the work so so so so it could be that NAD levels go down because their consumption goes up right so there's there's as we age there's more DNA damage there's more consumption the certuins need more of it and it goes up and then of course the question would become is the current level of NAD that we have rate limiting to that reaction if not then all the extra NAD in the world should have no benefit because you're just adding more substrate to a reaction where it's not needed. Uh, conversely, if NAD levels are going down because there's a production issue and if you provided more of it, you could actually do more good, well then it could be the exact opposite story. So, let me pause there for a moment and have you fill in the edges of everything I just said so that we can go deeper into this discussion.

[01:30:25] So maybe explain a little bit what NAD is, explain, you know, what it means in redox and obviously let's talk about certuins and the role that NAD plays there. Lots to unpack there. It could be a twohour uh a two-hour podcast. Um but one it's one area that we've worked on for the last 25 years. So we we were responsible for cloning the human suins actually after

[01:30:47] Lenny Garante published you know his paper on on su and yeast. We were the graduate student. Matt was the first to publish this, wasn't he? Uh Matt. Yeah, actually Matt and Brian. I mean, that the whole and and David, I mean, that whole gang was the original gang along with Lenny Garanti were paved the way for a lot of the what we know.

[01:31:08] Now, eventually, you know, like one thing that I would um just start by saying is that it pains me in some way in a field that is so rich and has generated so much data that there's a whole cloud. sort of lying on top of sertuins and NAD that you know there's nothing there's nothing there I I just tell people it is an incredibly u studied system uh we are still juggling the complexity and I would argue that any any field where um the the same degree of of investigation will be conducted will have the same controversy. This is the nature of science. The beauty of science is that it's incredibly messy on the way on the way up, but eventually things are are getting clarified. And I think in in the terms of the Suins, we're still right in the middle of it. So there's some complete garbage. I completely agree with that.

[01:32:01] And and by the way, I'm not completely dismissive. What I will say has made has made this field complicated is that the leading proponents of it have all opted for a commercial pathway. Agree. And therefore they have opted not to study this in a rigorous way but to study it in a commercial way. And unfortunat I mean I understand why you would do that. Like that's that's the nature of it. And this is not a molecule that you can put um uh you're not going to generate intellectual property in the same way that you would um around a novel drug. And so it poses a limitation to how these things can be studied. But unfortunately that coupled with the uh rveratrol fiasco uh and I I really unless you think otherwise Eric we don't need to talk about rveratrol but I I am

[01:32:50] I remain completely convinced that rveratrol had zero benefit whatsoever. I think it is an absolutely uh useless molecule. Um so I think that rveratrol debacle um the overhype complete debacle of that coupled with the fact that all of the participants in the NAD landscape are doing it through their own commercial enterprise with their own proprietary blend has has resulted in this inability to drive forward in this field.

[01:33:18] I agree. I agree. I think it's I mean you've identified the problems the hype and the commercialization. I mean commercialization can be helpful if the the companies are actually willing to invest in clinical trials and so on. You know, I always use the example of timeline uralithn a I mean there we've worked with them they do clinical trials rigorous there you know we they publish them in in the best journals and at the end you know what you're measuring and and so um that being said for the so let's try to maybe sort of step back and uh given the controversy I would say I would encourage your your listener not to just discard it all we're still in the middle of it and I think there's something interesting will emerge out of it so is a critical intermediary metabolite.

[01:34:04] It it has two big roles. First is it plays a key role in redux reactions. Again we've talked about these reaction reduction oxidation anytime electrons need to move around. Exactly. So it's it exists in two form NAD and ADH. Um and it's critical to intermediary metabolism. Uh there are more than 600 of these enzymes that use

[01:34:27] NAD in the whole metabolism. So it stands to reason that if you losing NAD levels, it's going to be you go below a certain critical level, these enzymes are going to suffer. Your whole metabolism is going to go down. And we know by the way that decreasing metabolic efficiency at all level is is one of the hallmarks of aging. So in addition to these enzymes that utilize the NADAH couple there's a whole series of other enzyme that actually are digesting cleaving NAD and these would be the PARPS bodus polymerase. So these are enzymes mostly involved in DNA repair. So it plays a critical role. U suins seven suins um all doing different things within the cell and we can go back and dig in into this a little bit in terms of what what are the sertuins doing. Um there's also uh another uh and two enzymes called CD38 and CD 157. And so these are also NAD hydraases and we are studying them a lot now. Um so that's I guess the the background uh of what uh these enzymes are doing. One thing that your your listeners should know about um uh about NAD levels and why the decrease in NAD levels are relevant to aging is with respect to the certuins because sertuins have a relatively narrow range of KD for NAD. So if the

[01:35:59] NAD levels change as we know they do during aging, it will lead to a change in the activity of the of the suins. And I think this is something that was proposed by Lenny Garante back in the days and showed for example even during fasting your NAD levels will increase and this will activate suin. So I think there's this is something that's really unique to the suin is there and we know this u in a really acute way because there are suins that are present in the cytoplasm versus in the mitochondria versus in the nucleus and the NAD levels in each of these organs are very different for example much higher in mitochondria. It turns out that 33 has a KD for um for

[01:36:41] NAD which is much higher than 31. And so variation so that really is the indication that they are sensors of NAD levels which goes back to the initial model that you mentioned NAD levels change during aging. Therefore we can expect the activity of the sertuins to change. Now um what else have I not addressed in in your initial batch of questions? I think we're now ready to then move on to if we believe with some conviction that restoring NAD levels in an aging individual is beneficial.

[01:37:25] We now have to deal with the same problem you deal with any small molecule or large molecule for that matter. How do you get it in the body? So how what are the ways in which you could get NAD into the body directly or indirectly? So that brings me to maybe another element of the biochemistry obviously. So one thing that has emerged is this idea that um the question is to why do NAD level decrease and there's been lots of theories uh activation of the PARPS that seems to be uh happening in C elegance but it in mammals uh this is the work of

[01:38:06] Eduardo Chini who was the first one to show that CD38 uh appears to be the major driver of the decrease of NAD during aging. And the way he's demonstrated this, and we've actually repeated some of his results and and and published on this as well, if you study a mouse that's knocked out for CD38, you find that ND levels actually do not decrease during aging.

[01:38:30] And that's pretty much across all organs. And I think that what this does is really brings uh the whole question is in terms of what should we be targeting. Now, think about did we talk about what CD38 is doing specifically? Yeah. So CD38 is a um as a membrane anchored protein. Some of it is facing um outward on the outside of the cell.

[01:38:53] Some of it is facing inward. Um for example in T- cells it's mostly facing inward. Um no outward in macrofase it's mostly facing inward. And it is in a dehydrase. Now what is it doing in the immune system? Why do we have it? Not entirely clear. One idea is that because it it is present in T- cell is it on non-immune cells uh endothelial cells okay as well um one idea at least for the immune system is that it might come up and and eat up all the NAD that's local in the extracellular fluid although there's not much of it and limit the ability as part of the innate immune response and part limit the ability of b of bacteria and other organism to actually access these micronutrient for their own growth. That's one thinking, but I think it's a lot more complicated than this. And we're really in the middle of it. I have a good part of my lab actually studying the role of CD38 in the immune system and in endothelial cells and in the brain as well.

[01:39:54] Now, you mentioned a moment ago that the CD38 knockouts do not see a decline in NAD with aging. Zero. And they live longer. I was just about to say, what is the phenotype of a CD38 knockout? What deficiency do they have? Uh, nothing that we can tell. And they live longer. How much longer? Uh 15%. That's comparable to rapamy.

[01:40:14] Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty significant. This has been published by Edward Chini. Why do you think that is? Do in other words, do you think that that is true true and unrelated to the increased pool of NAD? Now CD38. So that's that's a key question and that's one that's not been answered. Um, and I would say if I had to go on a limb, I would say it's not linked to the

[01:40:38] NAD decrease. Um, because it turns out that, sorry, just to make sure everybody understands what you're saying. You're saying your belief is that the CD38 mouse does the knockout does not live longer because he has more NAD. That's just another bit issue we're seeing and that there's something else about that mouse.

[01:40:57] Yes. Or it might be partially partially the NAD and partially the other mechanism. I'm about to discuss one thing that's remarkable is that uh as we age us and mice we see an increase in CD38 level um across the organism especially in the immune system we've published a paper showing that the SASP from scinsesscent cells is a very powerful inducer of CD38 expression in macrofasages so that's one mechanism by which uh we're linking you know scinsessence and the SAS to increase

[01:41:29] CD38 leading to a depletion of NAD and other effect and yet we have no idea what it's doing other than hydraying NAD. It has a cognate receptor on other cells. It's part of the you know it's they don't seem to be immune deficient. Uh they don't it's really one of these players that people there are hundreds of papers.

[01:41:49] I mean do do you think it plays a role in inflammation a negative role in inflammation? One idea about it is that it plays a suppressive role in the immune response. So because we see it being induced kind of ladish in the immune response and the idea it comes on to tamper down. So it's actually the exact opposite.

[01:42:07] It's it's it's so pro- anti-inflammatory that it can be harmful in that way as opposed to contributing to sterile inflammation which is the more typical problem we see in aging. Yeah, we we we did not discuss this but you know the corer the other side of the immune system is that it has to be incredibly balanced between reacting appropriately towards um exogenous pathogen but not reacting against the self. And as you know as a physician there are so many conditions that are a manifestation of an excess of immune response against the the individual all of the autoimmune response autoimmune diseases which by the way increase during aging. So the thinking is that um except for type 1 diabetes.

[01:42:55] Yes, that's the one young. Why do you I know that you used to study that. Why why do you think that is? It's really an interesting question. Although you know there's uh something called lad that I'm sure you you've heard about that is emerging that we might have been diagnosing some type two that were actually late type one. Yeah.

[01:43:13] Um the thing that is really unique about uh type one is the fact that um there I remember a number of papers that highlight the fact that there might be something happening during development that exposes um the uh immune system to the developing beta cells and that might trigger more autoimmunity at that time.

[01:43:37] It could also be linked to the fact that there's been for many years a discussion of the role of viruses infection and mim molecular mimicry between some of these viruses and and beta cells. So it could be that a subset of infections that happen during childhood actually puts you at at risk of activating your immune system inappropriately. So that that's the whole the whole idea. But there's clearly an increase autoimmunity throughout life.

[01:44:03] By the way, CD57, do we see the same effects? Do we have a CD57 knockout? No. Uh much less studied. There is some interesting effect also. But you know CD38 has garnered CD3 most of the attention. So you know if you think about I'll go back about CD38 and in terms of um what it's doing it's taking NAD and cleaving it into ADP ribos which is you know the sugar and nucleotide and and um and nicotinomide. Nicotinomide is a precursor to NAD and so this nicotenomide which is generated by CD38 but by the sertuins by the PARPS normally gets recycled um in a two-step reaction all the way back to NAD. Now what's really interesting is if you block this it's called the salvage pathway for nicotinomide. If you block it within a few hours your NAD levels go down to zero. So the system

[01:45:01] Wow. heavily dependent on recycling. incredible actually and there's a specific inhibitor of this enzyme called NMPT you can add it to cells we've done the experiment within four to six hours NAD levels down to zero the cell dies so there's an incredible churning through that whole pathway now which is a reflection of the activity of suins uh

[01:45:23] CD38 CD 157 the PARPs and so on um so you have a situation during aging where CD38 increases is you increase the degradation and so you decrease the pool of NAD but you're increasing in theory the metabolites you're increasing the metabolites nicotenomite now one important thing is nicotenomite um metabolism is either salvage back to NAD or methylation by an enzyme and this is important for supplementation because it turns out

[01:45:56] CD38 not only cleaves NAD but it also cleaves NMN which is one of the one of the two one of the two precursors NN and NR. So when you actually are have increased CD38 activity and you take NMN you churn through this pathway and actually you increase your nicotenomide and you increase its methylation.

[01:46:16] So NMN is also cleaved by CD38. Yes. Into what? Into uh nicotenomide plus something is not ADP ribos. Yes. Okay. And so when you do this you're increasing your level of nicotenomide to the point that uh it's shunting to methyl nicotenomide starts depleting your your one carbon cycle. So what you see in a number of people actually on an

[01:46:39] MN is their homocyine level going up including me um I I stopped taking it when I saw this. I thought this is not I was taking about a gram of NMN for a while and then I saw my homoyine level going up. I think as a reflection of this this pathway and basically stopped it. Now why is it Eric that the increased pool of nicotinomide preferentially goes down a methylation pathway as opposed to the salvage pathway to give you more

[01:47:07] NAD? I I don't think it goes pref preferentially. It just depends how much you It's just the more you put in even if it splits stokometrically or stochastically even it's it's you're just going to sell you're going to take away one carbon. Yeah. And I do not know what the the relative proportion is. But clearly the more you drive the system uh with NMN uh the more you're going to yield uh these and we can measure not only how much did your homoyine go up by the way up to 15 from from typical seven.

[01:47:40] Wow that's a big jump. And then how long did it take to resolve once you stopped the NMN? Well I only I measured typically every three months. So after after 3 to 6 months it had gone back to normal to 7 to eight. What about NR nicotenomide ribocide? How is that treated by CD38? Uh it's not it's not metabolized by itself. NR eventually in the cell has to make it back to NMN which is one is is on the on the salvage pathway that we talked about. Uh so NR is you know is is is less bulky less big than NMN. So it is able to get into the cell but eventually it makes it into nicotine NMN and then goes back into the same pathway. So eventually they all come back to the same.

[01:48:27] So do you think that there's no difference between the same amount of NR and NN? No, there clearly are some differences um especially in all the really complex biochemistry that happens in terms of getting them into cells. You know there are the problem with NR and NMN is that you are if you think about what the approach is you're essentially you have a pool of NAD which is a sink think about a sink full of water and you keep you know it's leaking that's your CD38 that's that's the leak at the bottom of the sink and you keep pouring more NMN more NR inside of it you're just going to you're just going to accelerate you know the leak or you're going to make it you're not going to solve the problem basically maybe you'll reestablish the val the level at a normal semi-normal but the churning through is is problematic now why is the churning through problematic because some of the byproducts of CD38 for example are um u cyclic ADP ribos uh so there's two forms of ADP ribos not cyclized and cycized cyclized activates um calcium signaling and so there's a whole aspect of the biology of CD38 that's linked to calcium signaling. So I think I do worry about the supplementation with the NR and NMN.

[01:49:52] Um I do worry about it. I'm not discounting them. I think clinical trials are ongoing. There's dozens of clinical trials. So we will soon identify something that in which it has a benefit. Again, if you think about the the metabolism of these metabolites, um it's incredibly complicated. There are effects on the microbiome. There are effects on, you know, different absorption by different cells. Just literature, hundreds and hundreds of papers, I think way beyond what your audience probably wants to hear. But um uh and I would say, you know, at this point, most of what you can buy as supplement have doses that are so low.

[01:50:34] This is where there's an important discordance also when we do experiment. We've seen amazing things in in laboratory animals in terms of supplementing with an RNN. This is where the excitement comes from. But typically these animals are getting 10 times more than what you're buying as a supplement. And the reason is I think you know grass uh sort of status is given to these companies to give a small amount.

[01:51:01] Yeah. Grass meaning generally regarded as safe. FDA's criteria for giving something that is naturally occurring that doesn't requine

[01:51:16] went from 7 to 15 um I guess two questions would be has that been reported elsewhere is there do we is that a known phenomenon in the trials that are testing NMN are they measuring homoyine to see if that's I must have read it somewhere because I was I was you were looking for it I was looking for it And then the second question is how would you then tolerate 10 grams of NMN? I mean if one gram is doing that what I mean now you're you would deplete all one carbon. What does that does that mean you wouldn't even be able to alter your epiggenome in ways that might be favorable? it it it you run all all kinds of risk and you know a number of people that I I've seen the same thing and start taking trimethly or you know you know so to try to supplement this I I I do worry about this I think for me um and again I want to reiterate the fact that I think the data and animal models of what some of the things that we've seen with some of these precursors is really interesting and and really you know this is why there's so much interest did you ever try using TMG to see if it would offset the

[01:52:20] No, I didn't. That would be an interesting little self experiment. Um, okay. What about intravenous NAD? So, that that is sort of one of my pet peeves. Um, and again, you know, I try in everything to be to remain open-minded to things that I don't know and don't understand. My prediction is that first NAD is not a an extracellular molecule. NAD does not exist or almost does not exist at all in the plasma. It is an intracellular and as I mentioned you know high concentration in the mitochondria somewhat much lower in the cytoplasm in the nucleus. So the whole idea of injecting intravenous NAD is first it's too big to be absorbed by cells. So what is the body doing with it? There is a famous paper by uh Josh Benovitz

[01:53:14] Robinovitz that showed that if you inject it actually introvenously you actually get it mostly calibed by the liver into nicotinomide. Now nicotenomide is one of the fraction of nascin. You can buy this at the pharmacy for very cheap. You can go into a an IV clinic and get a $700 injection of NAD. um very few studies, one or two I I've read both of them, they're interesting.

[01:53:44] Um so my opinion is that NAD introvenously is not something that should be done. Um the same thing for in you know subcutaneously. I've seen another company that sells it um subcutaneously. Really no evidence for doing this. Now that being said, I've heard and this is where I try to remain open-minded because there obviously we don't know everything. Um I have heard sort of anecdotal evidence of dramatic effect in some patients with

[01:54:16] Parkinson's. people really describing sort of a not a miraculous but a near miraculous effect right after the infusion having increase in motor performance that you can really assess in someone who's has severe Parkinson so um again not studied systematically there's a lot is there mechanistically is there a reason you could explain that yes through dopamine or something else there's a whole literature on uh on the effect of uh NAD precursors and so on on

[01:54:50] Parkinson's mostly animal models and I think there are lots of clinical trials going on in Parkinson's as well. So but more using the standard NR and NMN. Uh the thing that I've described is more couple of friends who've told me I've seen this um um not enough to you know to to make a product but enough maybe to question maybe this is there's something more to it than than than what we truly know. But you know the proliferation of these introvenous clinic frankly how complicated is it to produce a bag of intravenous NAD

[01:55:23] I don't think it's very expens very very complicated I mean I I've never made I know um making NMN uh at purity is is really it's not you know took some effort to scale it up and so some of the companies that have been doing this right now there's like one major supplier out of China that pretty much everybody uses um but in terms of NAD I

[01:55:45] I think this is this is an industrial process and and I I can tell you it's not $700. Yeah, I'm sure it's not. So, do you think I if if a person was going to supplement with one orally, do you think there's a case for NR being superior to NMN? I would say no. Uh I would say take them both. Uh if you're going to do something and you want to a bit of an insurance, you know, let's say and and I I did this for a while. I I'm not doing it right now. Uh you know take 250 milligrams of each and and and you'll have a half a gram. You are in a safe relatively safe dose. Follow your homoyine.

[01:56:26] Um if you are, you know 60 or above, you you could make the case this could be part of of a stack. Although this is the same thing that we see with so many of these supplements right now. You know how which one do you take? Which ones are beneficial? There's one a little bit of a dark cloud linked to um uh NAD supplementation is the demonstration that the SASP is actually uh dependent uh on um on NAD levels. And so when you are actually uh increasing NAD levels, you might be increasing these pro-inflammatory markers. So because let me make sure I understand why because the SASPs which for folks listening these are the soluble products made by the scinsesscent cells that effectively are doing all the bad things that we don't want to see scesscent cells doing.

[01:57:17] So now they are dependent on CD38 to some extent. So as CD38 goes up they go up and are you saying as you give more NR and more NMN you might churn it up. You might be turnurning up the SASPs. Yeah. The other thing also is there's been some by the way all of this speak let me let me finish you you finish your point and then I want to make a broader point.

[01:57:40] No there's there's also some uh worry about the fact that uh supplementing with some of these uh these precursors might also accelerate tumor growth. So this would not have an effect in in in you and I who don't have a cancer but if it's someone out there who has a an early form of a cancer this could lead to an acceleration. This is something that's been shown in animal models that it giving some you know some powers to some people in terms of recommending this to be uh taken over by everyone.

[01:58:11] Now the the folks who make this have strenuously denied that there is any um any validity to those animal models that have suggested that or the um and some of this has been done in in in um in vitro as well. Correct. Um, so how I'm not I'm not very familiar with that literature. I saw I remember seeing one study. It was very small. Uh, you know, my take on it was I guess if you had cancer, this might be a bad idea to take. Uh, but but but I didn't find it that convincing. So, so

[01:58:47] I I agree with you and it's it's it is a general consideration for our whole field of longevity research is uh you know better is the enemy of good is something that was uh sort of drilled into me as I went through medical school you know u we have a term in French which is um sort of like therapeutic uh overdoing it you know just uh doing too much there's such a thing as overdoing it for your patient

[01:59:16] And in this case, the whole longevity field, you know, is embracing a whole series of these um interventions. I mean, there's not a a week that doesn't go by that I don't see a new supplement being touted online and so on. And I read about all of them. The question is um which ones should you be taking? Uh which ones are actually risky, which ones are not? And and to me, this is part of the whole balance of the equilibrium I'm trying to reach. If there's something that really has a beneficial effect, you want to be on it as soon as possible. If not, um, you know, why take the chance?

[01:59:51] Yeah, I think that's I mean, you've said it, that's the point I was going to make at the outset, but but you you've said it so much better. Um, let's pivot a little bit to a couple other things I want to chat about quickly. Let's talk about interlucan 11. So big trial last fall that looked at blocking interlucan 11 which is a molecule that's made by immune cells plays an important role in inflammation. Um and this was done in mice and those mice lived longer. What do you make of the study?

[02:00:20] Read the paper like you. I don't have sort of an inside knowledge about inter of course when the paper came out it was like interlucan 11. I mean we as an iminologist you talk about one interlucan one two four seven six seven you know but 11 never heard about it. So I went to and there's actually you know it goes up to like 30. So I I went and read the paper. It's it's an inflammatory marker. So again it could be a on par with one in six.

[02:00:48] No, I would say probably not. Um so it came out a little bit in the left out out of the left field. Um but it sort of makes sense in the context of what we know about the inflammatory response linked to aging. So and maybe this is where I can I can add one point is when we think about the chronic inflammation of aging sort of inflammaging um it is both cause and effect.

[02:01:16] We talked about how the immune response um helps you to protect yourself against um uh the innate immune response against pathogen as a first line of defense. The innate immune response also has another important role is that it recognizes damage any kind of damage. If you cut yourself, if you have a a wound of of you know inside of your organ, coronary artery, a coronary artery, a coronary artery, the this will act any kind of damage, unfolded proteins, there's all kinds of things. So the innate immune response will be triggered and will activate itself. So as we age and as damage slowly accumulates because aging isn't is a slow irreversible accumulation of damage um eventually your immune system responds to this by becoming chronically activated. And so the problem is that you might think well this is great because you actually repairing all of this damage. The problem is the activation of the immune response by itself becomes problematic because these cells macrofasages for example a powerful tissue remodeler and so the immune system in this case is sort of Dr. ejaculate mystic hide it's helping but it's it's facing an uncsurmountable amount of damage and eventually its activation leads to NAD depletion that's one of the things that it does but many other things stem cell dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction so the whole idea here is that um

[02:02:48] IL1 might simply be I mean is one of the key markers of this chronically activated immune system so this is not something I imagine you're going to give to a 20 year old but in someone who's getting really in the part where chronic immune age immune activation is present um could really play an important role in the future and what the paper showed was again in mice but from what I understand is already an existing molecule uh yes and they're actually recently was contacted by a company that has another uh novel inhibitors of of IL11 you could imagine this to become part of the whole armamentarium that we have against aging.

[02:03:29] And then how do you see playing that off something on the other side of the spectrum? Because because we're really trying to deal with two sides of this system. We want to tamp down the part that's overactive and we want to ramp up the part that's underactive. So we've got basically the only example we have over here is rapamy. This one does this.

[02:03:48] And then we now have IL11 inhibition or I mean they use knockout mice but block this. That did good things. So is this one of those things where you need to do both to get and by the way maybe you have growth hormone over here as well one there also anti-1 as well which yeah block IL1 block IL11 give growth hormone give rapamy I mean but here's the problem you get into this reductionist state which is like the whole NAD world of NR and NMN hey it sounds great but what if there's unintended consequences we can't see like even as much as I love thinking about this and want to do all of these things, I start to think, man, what is the probability we're going to get this right?

[02:04:31] Agree. And the immune system is uh an incredibly tenuous system, which is in really delicate balance. So the balance is too much immunity. You might say, well, this is good protection against cancer, protection against uh microbes, right? But then you get autoimmunity. But then you get autoimmunity. Not enough immunity. Well, you you run the risk of being, you know, killed by a pneumonia or some kind of infection, but at least you don't have too much inflammation.

[02:05:01] Yes. Yeah. So, there's a very fine balance. And well, this this gets to this is why I wish we had a dashboard. We What are the biomarkers we can use for these things because we don't have this problem with blood pressure? We don't have this problem with thyroid hormone. We don't have this problem with so many things that we treat because we can measure what we care about.

[02:05:22] That's a a good point. Then the question is you know what is first I mean the immune system is so complex there's not going to be one single marker uh you know my colleague David Ferman is this this thing called I age which is a immune aging set of uh test that you can actually uh conduct um that was the first attempt at trying to measure immune aging you know they have a whole bunch of what do they actually measure is it all serum biomarkers yes serum biomarkers and mostly cytoines

[02:05:50] CXC validated how uh been validated in clinical studies. So they they've I am immunoaging. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I age. Oh, I age. Okay. Yes. I I don't know. I don't know if it's uh So, this was developed and pioneered by uh David Ferman and Mark Davis. Uh so, David Ferman is with us at the Bach. Mark Davis is still at Stanford. Um

[02:06:14] I guess this brings us to um to clocks. Yes. I don't even know if I have the energy to talk about this. Um, okay. Where do you want to begin? There's so many of these things out there. Yes. Some of them are commercially available. Some of them are just tools of research at the moment. Some of them aim to tell you an actual age, an actual number that represents your biological age as opposed to your chronological age. Some of them don't aim to tell you that at all. They just want to tell you a rate of aging. uh some of them look only at the epigenetic signature. In other words, they look directly at the methylation uh sequence, others look at a host of markers, including some very simple serum biomarkers like glucose levels and vitamin D levels and things like that.

[02:07:08] So, how do you make sense of all of those tools? Right now, we don't. Um I think so. First first statement is they are not ready for prime time in terms of patient management. There are research tools. Uh and I think I which is interesting because they're far outside of research labs at this point. Yes, they are available commercially. U

[02:07:35] I've done the same thing. I don't remember who told you told me someone actually was it Matt Matt uh measured his clocks. I do the same thing actually. I measure them every 3 months and uh I use it's just a scatter plot. It's a scatter plot in a way you know I'm between 25 and 68. uh which is of course I like the clock that you know show me to be young but uh so that being said um so we know that you know we're learning so we know that for example you you alluded to the fact that they they can vary the same clock there's circa circadian variation for example five years so your age can vary by five years using some of the clocks depending on when you measure uh when you you what time of day yeah what time of day which is you know that's biology ology that just tells you you know the epiggenome is something that's highly dynamic and so that's something as we learn obviously you know the companies will will encourage you to measure it you know to draw the blood always at the same time um now the whole field right now is pretty much focused almost completely focused on um

[02:08:43] DNA methylation I you know and Steve Horvat has done beautiful work I mean it's really pioneering work identifying and all this and uh Morgan Lavine and others have have gone on you know Dan Bellski I think with Denedin Pace uh which is another epigenetic clock that measures the pace of aging. By the way I think this is probably my favorite because it it really uh seems to be um responding to interventions. You know if you go if you change your diet or if you do something you will see your your pace of aging uh changing. So, I think that one to me seems uh more promising. Um, but it's a whole small, you know, we don't know really how to use these tools clinically. That's the problem. They're they're nice gadgets to to buy, you know, and the companies are selling you supplements and then they're selling you the uh the tests with it. I don't know what to make of it. U personally, I think this is not ready for prime time.

[02:09:44] It's something that should be done uh in the future. uh it might become in the future. Would you agree with my stern words on this? Because I've I've made a lot of enemies by saying that if as a consumer you encounter a company that is selling you a test, especially a test that is not validated in any clinic clinically meaningful way and then in the same breath selling you a supplement to fix the result of that test. You need to run.

[02:10:18] I agree. I mean I I just I I don't have the patience for that kind of behavior. Someone told me actually um recently that u one of these tests actually that you can measure almost everyone who who gets their result is low and of course low being good or bad in this test or whatever. No, it's bad. Bad. Yeah, it's insufficient. And the next step is the recommendation. You have to buy this supplement to solve the problem. So yes,

[02:10:47] I I think you know um again it's the same thing with the Sertuins and the NAD. Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There is a whole series of these players. Uh I'm not disputing their honesty or or their good intention. Uh from what I've seen, I think it's too early. And what do you think is the biggest problem? Is the biggest problem the biologic noise in the system? Which means even if you had the absolute perfect tool to measure and you knew exactly what to measure, the movement of that thing is so great that the probability that you're capturing a meaningful value is irrelevant. In other words, imagine that there's a variable that moves like this.

[02:11:31] But on the small level, it's moving like this. And I'll give you an example. Imagine you were measuring heart rate, but you could only sample it milliseconds at a time, and what you were actually measuring was heart rate variability instead of heart rate. It would be useless. It's too noisy. Agree. I agree.

[02:11:50] Do you think that's the problem? No, I don't think that's a problem. And I I I'll speak personal experience. I you know, I I work with True Diagnostic. They when you get you know they use the epic array and you get not one clock you get dozens. So I get all of them and they tend to be reproducible you know every three months unless I make some interventions but in general there is some cons consistency and I'm not the only one who has seen this. So my advice if you really are determined to use them use all of them. They all are sort of a different mirrors of of your reality.

[02:12:29] You know these the problem of the methylation clocks is that there's a very tenuous link between the change of methylation at any given site and the biology. So when you know typically the clock will measure about 500 uh will rely each clock will rely on about 500 different methylation sites but they're not attached to a specific gene. So you don't really know what it means. But how are they even doing that? They're not measuring with point arrays. How how are they?

[02:12:57] No, they do this with arrays. Yeah, they have about 20 20 million methylation sites that they're assessed, but each clock uses a subset 4 500. Now, the biggest problem with the clocks from my perspective, sorry, just to be clear, you're saying they're actually measuring point of methylation. Yes. Okay.

[02:13:16] Yes. Yes. Um, they're quantifying the level of methylation at each of these sites. Um the problem with the clocks is also where do you obtain them from? Uh typically blood as I mentioned. Yes. It's a it's a heterogeneous compartment. As you age for example you know that your fraction of naive tea cells decreases y down to close to zero. If you're 80 years old your memory tea cells increase. So we did a very simple experiment. We sorted all of these different T- cell subsets. memory, naive, uh, central memory, TM rather, determinally differentiated, and measured their epigenetic age using several of the clocks. 20 to 25 year difference between native the naive or naive sorry and the and the central memory T in the right direction the direction you would the naive are much longer.

[02:14:11] Yeah. So which is I you know that's somewhat interesting that was really interesting for me because it means also any conditions where you see a shift in the relative proportion of these cells for example you get an acute COVID infection what happens you have a massive expansion of your uh your your memory tea cells so it looks like you're going to and then you sample and given that these cells look much older than the other ones you're going to look like you're aging and so

[02:14:41] Um so and there's a whole literature that talks about accelerated aging in rheumatoid arthritis in COVID in HIV all of these conditions that are all associated with chronic immune activation. So what we so that's another confounding variable. So what we did to do this with a a student in the lab, we we made a new clock in which we eliminated all of these um methylation sites that are linked to differentiation. Okay. So now this clock that we've done does not vary actually as a function of the types of cells that are in the blood. Okay. So as as a as a

[02:15:24] T- cell goes from being a naive T- cell to being a memory T- cell to being a TRA the methylation patterns changed as part of the epigenetic regulation. So we eliminated all of those sites and made a new clock called intrin clock which actually is impervious to um your level of immune activation. And what's interesting is that that clock doesn't change anymore during COVID. It doesn't change very little during HIV. It doesn't change during a whole series of conditions where people have talked about aging acceleration including um the story that we talked about earlier on growth hormone.

[02:16:01] What does change it then? What does change it? Uh cancer scinsessence which is really interesting. What about short-term interventions that might be beneficial? So, if you took an individual who uh is insulin resistant and you put them on a GLP1 agonist and 3 months later they're 20 pounds lighter and their insulin resistance has has resolved, how does that change on the clock? Well, I would not be able to tell you specifically for individual clocks, but uh Dan Bellski's Dened in Pace clock is the one that repeatedly people have shown seems to be responding to interventions which is you know the two the two qualities that you want in a clock is one to be predictive and the other one to be predictive of ultimate income sort of you know life expectancy or the occurrence of disease but also So you want it to be um modulatable, responsive and many of them actually but the and and reproducible and reproducible. Yes.

[02:17:06] Reproducible I think is more a question of the laboratory that's doing it. So there are but also potentially the biologic noise still. Exactly. So so biologic noise and laboratory conditions speak to reproducibility. I agree with what you said. I mean, I I've I've often made this case when people ask me about clocks is um my gripe with with the age clock. So, again, the pace clock is different because it's just trying to give you a rate of aging. And

[02:17:30] I agree with you. I think there might be more there. But but these clocks that spit out, "Hey, Eric, congratulations. You're 25." I say to someone who says, "Isn't that wonderful?" I say, "Maybe." But do you actually believe that a 60 you're 68 you're 68 and your clock said you're 25. Should I expect you to live another 55 years?

[02:17:55] Yes. In other words, is it predictive? Is it a better predictor of future life than chronologic age? And the answer is to my knowledge no. There is no clock that has a better ability to predict lifespan uh than chronologic age does. And until that's the case, I worry that the biologic clocks are creating a bit of a distraction, at least this this subset of clocks, and that we we maybe ought to focus better on clocks where the readout state is more about is this intervention good or bad. Yeah. or is this a net positive intervention or a net negative intervention?

[02:18:37] I agree and I as as we mentioned earlier the the field initially focused on the epigenetic clocks because this is Steve's Horvat's pioneering work. So it got everybody to start thinking we can generate these tools but the field is now moving into um proteomics clock. Is that what Dan So what makes up Dan's clock?

[02:18:58] Dan is methylation. It's also methylation. Why do you think it's doing a better job than maybe Horvath's clock at the moment? I think typically it really depends on how you know how the tool what the variable what the cohort you know how what the question was. I think um I I I don't know. I mean I think that

[02:19:22] Dance is the only one that's doing it in in this way. Why is it working better? They're just looking at in a completely different way. How how much is AI facilitating this at this point? I mean, machine learning is is a key instrument. Essentially, what these clocks are is a regression analysis onto, you know, you start with a variable, which is your age, and you regress each methylation site onto onto the age. You do this on enough people of different ages, you find an average, you know, and eventually what the clocks

[02:19:52] I wonder if that's the wrong way to do it. Wouldn't it be better to bioank these to to get biobanked data and instead of mapping it onto age app it map it onto number of years remaining in life because if you'll know that in a bio bank they've done this they've done this they've done this in terms of uh life expectancy they've done this in terms of morbidity so this is like the third and fourth generation of these clocks now are looking at regression not only on on chronological the the initial one was just chronologically Yeah. And and

[02:20:25] Steve used to go around saying my correlation coefficient is 99. And I was like, well, that's because that's what you built it on. Yeah. Exactly. I I could look at a calendar, you know, I don't need I don't need an epigenetic clock to tell me how how old I am. But the next generation clocks actually had a bigger spread when you look at you. Of course, you have an average.

[02:20:44] That's right. Because they started to build it on a different variable. Exactly. So um what really excites me right now is the whole idea that the field is is moving on to the next stage which is non-epigenetic clocks uh because I'm still frustrated as a biologist trying to understand what what are what are these clocks it should be everything I mean why would we do I mean it doesn't make any sense to me that we wouldn't look at the metabolome the proteome and the epiggenome I mean we should look at every I mean there's there's no excuse today with the compute power not to do that right we have clocks based on fundus

[02:21:17] We have clocks based on skin. We have clocks based on facial recognition. So the clocks are going to be uh measured you know using dozens of different uh biological variables. Uh any biome small company in the Bay Area is using it the tongue a tongue picture the old doctor looking at your tongue. So you can actually use machine learning to recognize patterns of know discoloration and and and and um another you know exciting really story was I I don't know if you're familiar with a Tony Whisker's paper uh using proteomics he has shown for example proteome in plasma changes throughout life y pretty dramatic matter which is really completely mindboggling for me to see that you can be so different as you age uh in terms of your whole blood prote why I mean wouldn't you if if the epiggenome is changing then gene expression is changing if gene expression is changing no yeah yeah yeah it's okay but we and we haven't you know so they've used this to that it would change to such a degree Tony has a beautiful slide which shows you know all of the proteium in the blood and how the colors changed across and do you think that most of those changes are post-transational no Most of them are probably expression level.

[02:22:39] It's expression. Yeah, it's expression. Okay. Um so people are building transcrytoics clock and so um Tony now has a study that is I believe in press or coming out soon um where they've gone back using this proteomics clock and they've done this um uh on a UK bioank more than 40,000 different people and this is the study I we started this discussion on identifying which organs are uh so what what Tony did was actually remarkable

[02:23:11] He looked at each of these proteins that are in the blood and selected some that were predictive to be coming from unique organs. Imagine the what you know about how you measure a tropommyioin for for heart attack. So they did this they went and looked in every single organ and say okay what proteins are specific of this organ and which ones actually can be measured into the plasma and using this they were able to generate what they call an organ specific clock. So what they simp simply from a blood draw they're able to um to really determine um do you have a frailty point in your when I look at you is there like suffering happening in and this is Tony's work through the podium. Tony was corre it's it's a new startup called Vero uh which is u I I mean full disclosure I've joined the board of this company but I I I only joined the board because I was really excited about what they're trying to do and I think it really brings a whole new dimension to these predictive biomarker which is more aligned to what you and I have seen as physicians you know it's sort of simple mind it if it's a protein is released into the blood it shouldn't be there uh it might be indicating uh some suffering and I I've discussed with some colleagues who have used these clocks and have identified some abnormal aging in in a unique organ only to go back and find that there was indeed one problem without going into you know what the issues were but you can yeah I mean the challenge the thing that the reason I tend to be a slow um adopter of these things is even if that's the case the question is how much noises in the system. So I go and do that test on a patient and it comes back and says, "Oh my god, there's something wrong with your liver. Your kidney is a bit too old. You're this. You're that.

[02:25:05] You're this. You're that." So I have two fundamental questions. The first is could I have figured that out another way? So if it's telling me your liver is angry or something's wrong with your liver, how do your transaminases look? Right? If it's telling me something's wrong with your kidney, could I have picked that up on a urinary analysis looking at, you know, 20, you know, creatinin clearance or, you know, cyaten

[02:25:26] C or something else? In other words, is it giving me information that I can get elsewhere in a more reproducible, more validated fashion? The second thing is, let's say it tells me seven things are not perfect and I ultimately, and by the way, everything looks perfect. So, I have my standard essays, everything looks awesome. This test says, "Oh my god, these six or seven things are problematic." And I go poking around, poking around, poking around, and I find out one of them is indeed not working, but the other six were perfectly fine.

[02:25:57] So now we have this huge false positive situation. It's Yeah, exactly. It's the same problem we have with cancer screening, which is, you know, buyer needs to beware of the Pandora's box you open. And at least with MRI, you're dealing with imaging. But this sounds like exciting and yet it's a bit of a black box.

[02:26:16] Agree. Where it's gonna spit out, oh my god, there's something wrong with your left testicle and oh my, what do I need to do? You know, and that that being said, I think, you know, the essays are generated in a way that there are multiple. It's not like one single protein like a tripomyosin. We know that that's a clear indicator.

[02:26:34] There's something cell death in terms of your heart. In this case, the clocks are generated in a way that there are multiple sentinels for each organ. You know, many uh the story I was talking about. So early days, okay, we totally agree with this. It's a startup. I think they will um you know they will deploy it and obviously it's going to take again a group of physicians who are able to look at these tests and this is this is what researches this is what startup you know I can't blame them for trying because I think it has a potential for example to highlight a frailty point which is in in aging research to me is really critical you could have the best mind and the best heart in the world um if something else is going to fail that you are completely unaware of you want to know as soon as as you can. And so they they they you know my prediction is um I'll share the paper with you uh if you're interested in looking. It it's quite exciting in terms of where where this is leading but I agree with you early days.

[02:27:35] Yeah, I will probably maintain a shockingly high degree of skepticism um and and probably enjoy some experimentation with it. But again, my my experience in the real world is that that's just not how it works, right? There aren't people walking around that are insanely remarkably healthy where everything looks amazing, but they have some time bomb they don't know about with the exception of a few things that

[02:28:02] I I'm not sure it would pick up. For example, cancer is always that thing. And of course, there's an entire field of, you know, medicine that's going around with liquid biopsies that's exactly trying to solve that problem. It could be you could reword the liquid biopsy industry through the lens you said which is it's looking for that weakest link which in this case is the earliest signs of cancer and and it could be that a cancer will manifest itself also in local organ suffering and and again leeching it might actually point along with a liquid biopsy that tells you you have some cancer cell it might tell you it might point you to one place where actually this is actually happening yeah again uh it's it's interesting you know the the the case that I've made about MRI is the same because I I have a whole bunch of physician friends who tell me I get a I get a yearly MRI and they tell me why do you do this? I say well because I would rather know and he said well you're going to find all kinds of things. I said we did find something.

[02:28:58] I had a tumor in in behind my jaw and it turns out some mass. It it was not a tumor but it took me six months of worrying about what it was and and decided not to biopsy anything. My sense of all of this is that these are novel ways to practice medicine that Yeah. Yeah. And and and and and I'm I'm I'm criticized heavily for being too much on the forefront of doing that. Um but probably not nearly as far as some.

[02:29:26] Right. I still at the end of the day I think about every time you do a test one, you never do a test unless you're willing to act on an outcome or you have a sense of how an outcome will change your your behavior. like it. We don't order tests for the sake of information. We order tests to make decisions. Um and therefore you must at a minimum understand the full suite of outcomes that can come from the test and how many of them will pose huge trouble for you.

[02:29:57] I I I think honestly a a 20% of my patients opt not to do whole body MRI. Yes. Um, and I fully endorse that decision and I try to talk p patients out of it. I really try to highlight how many times we find thyroid nodules that we have to put needles into that ultimately end up being nothing and all we do is subject them to that risk and the anxiety that comes along with it.

[02:30:22] So, um, anyway, that that's I I I'm I'm I'm eager to look at this because I do think that the proteom offers a lot, but um I'm always worried about going a little too far on the clinical implication of a test. I agree. I'm I'm with you in terms of being careful. I I view this as a as another attempt. And for example, you know, we talked about the the data showing that the two organs that appear to be rate limiting in terms of aging, the immune system and the brain, that came out of that that that story. These were that's actually title of the paper essentially that identifies the brain and the immune system. So they they have a whole series of immune immune markers that are predictive uh of you know some degree of immune activation and so on.

[02:31:08] Well, Eric, there's a lot of other things I wanted to chat about, but I think what we'll do is we'll have you come back out to Austin for another day of driving at Kota, and then we'll we'll we'll we'll justify it by doing another podcast where we dive deeper into some of these topics. We we really take advantage of the fact that we have the best raceourse in the country here in our backyard. So, absolutely.

[02:31:28] Um I think you're going to have fun tomorrow and good. You'll be like, "Let's come right back and do it again every month." I'm looking forward to this. Thank you, Eric. Thank you. [Music]
