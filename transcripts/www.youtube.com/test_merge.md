## Description

Eric Verdin is a physician-scientist & the CEO of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. In this episode, Eric traces his scientific journey from studying viruses to leading aging research at the Buck Institute, offering insights into how aging impairs immune & nervous system function—including thymic shrinkage, chronic inflammation, & reduced vaccine response—& how these changes impact lifespan. He explores the metabolic underpinnings of aging, such as oxidative stress & insulin & IGF-1 signaling, & he discusses practical tools like zone 2 cardio, ketogenic diets, & GLP-1 drugs. The conversation also covers declining NAD levels with age, the roles of NAD-consuming enzymes such as sirtuins & CD38, & what current NAD-boosting strategies can & can’t accomplish. Eric weighs in on promising longevity interventions including rapamycin, growth hormone for thymic regeneration, & anti-inflammatory therapies, the promise & limitations of current biological age tests, & the potential of combining epigenetic, proteomic, & organ-specific metrics with wearables to guide personalized longevity care.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I talk about these things called the four horsemen. The four things that are basically coming for us all. I really should have added a fifth horsemen and that is immune health. Thank you for bringing this up. There are two organs that are rate limiting in terms of your aging and it's the central nervous system and the immune system.

[00:00:17] What is our strategy for mitigating immune decline? The proof is in the pudding pudding in a way that we know exercising and a combination of exercise is the best anti-aging intervention we have. Turn over to where you wanted to around metabolism. What is it about metabolism that really is so important? I'm convinced that it is fuel utilization. I think ketones are probably the the cleanest fuel to burn in terms of again byproducts oxidative stress.

[00:00:44] You're going to put more GLP1 in the system. you're going to overcome the resistance at the beta cell. You make more insulin. You now have better glucose control. Everybody wins. I just wanted to really experiment for myself to try to see, okay, what is this drug really doing? And it's it's been nothing short of remarkable, I think.

[00:01:02] How could it be that supplementing NAD does not lead to a longer, better life or some health benefit? Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia.

[00:01:20] Uh, Eric, thank you so much for uh for coming to to Austin. I know it wasn't just to talk to me. I know that half of it was uh was getting you to drive on the track at Kota tomorrow with me. So, uh we're going to have some fun there. My pleasure. But um as much as I think the two of us could sit here and talk about race cars for the next three hours, I don't think the audience would appreciate it or care for it as much as they will care for what we will talk about which is um your work in geoscience. Um so maybe give folks a little bit of a sense of what attracted you to this field and uh you know how your how your journey and background brought you where you are. It's a bit of a serendipitous type of story in a way that I I'm an MD by training from

[00:02:05] Belgium. Did my last year of medical school at Harvard and this just uh uh sort of opened my world my eyes to a whole world. Uh I was the first person in my family to go to college. So this was uh you know ending up at Harvard with some of the best teachers, some of the best students was just mind-blowing.

[00:02:22] And I went to medical school wanting to do research. there was never had that sort of a doctor fiber I call it. really wanted to actually do research and um and so after this um finished medical school and came back for directly a postoc uh at at the Joslyn Clinic working on diabetes and metabolism and um and so this is where the story gets circuitous um ended up becoming interested in the the reason for uh the ethology of type 1 diabetes u and worked on viruses and autoimmunity um this eventually led me to you know mostly a career in verology which confuses people. So I spent many years working on on a variety of viruses including HIV and and herpes viruses and so on. And through that work, we ended up cloning a family of protein called the uh uh some of the first epigenetic regulators, the

[00:03:16] HDAXs. And the HDAX at the time that was that was 1996, we were responsible for the cloning of a whole family of these epigenetic regulators. Um ended up being important in aging. And starting in around 1995, 1996, my lab slowly shifted towards the study of aging. And to this point today actually I only have one last postoc in the lab who's working on on HIV. The whole lab is actually focused on on epigenetics, imunology and metabolism. So that the interface between these uh these variables.

[00:03:52] So in some way it's it's it's the beauty of an academic career which um I've just followed my interest and uh and sometimes followed the money a little bit in terms of funding. Yeah. Um and uh and now I mean I have another you know additional responsibility which is to lead the Buck Institute for Research on

[00:04:09] Aging. So I split my time between the lab and uh the some more leadership type of activities. You mentioned two things there uh metabolism and immunology. Um talk a little bit more about how each of those individually contributes to aging. I think most people will intuitively understand it but but talk maybe a little deeper about it. Well, first imunology uh is central to aging in many respects. Um one of the and we can I hope we can talk get to talk about this later. There is data showing that there are two organs that are rate limiting in terms of your aging and it's the central nervous system and the immune system.

[00:04:50] And the reason uh for this is actually uh one could have predicted this based on the fact that both organs are distributed organs. If you think of your immune system, it's located in pretty much throughout the whole organism. And so its activity can influence the the well-being or the the functioning of every single organ. The same goes for uh the central nervous system. And there's recent study coming out actually from the lab of Tony Whisker showing that uh those biomarkers that measure aging in those organs appears to be uh the most predictive of your lifespan. There's also um incredible data showing um that if you induce a specific lesion in the immune system for example in in mice model if you if you knock out ERCC1 DNA damage repair only in in the bone marrow so that the whole immune system is affected you actually induce accelerated aging in the whole organism and scinsessence in every single organ. So there's the the immune system in what in what model?

[00:05:58] Uh it's been done in two different models in mice. So this been done with the ERCC1 mutation. It's also been done by knocking down the the major trans tam the major transcription factor for mitochondria. So if you induce mitochondrial dysfunction only in the immune system, you induce secondary scinessence in the whole organ.

[00:06:15] Do you think that would be true in mammals? Sorry, in humans. It's that that's always it's a million-dollar question. in in some way the it's been shown in in two different models in mice B6 which which yeah B6 I don't remember the exact strain of the mouse but u uh there's no reason why it should be different frankly um and it speaks to the importance of the immune system the second way for the immune system is through chronic inflammation which is you know tied cause and effect in the whole aging process um now and we can talk about this later as well I find it fascinating you know the whole idea of chronic inflammation which is induced by the aging process but which itself actually further accelerates aging. So there's really a lot of lot of work that's being conducted in this area. Um the other one that you were asking is metabolism I think is can I ask you a question before we go?

[00:07:12] Yeah. Um that's a very interesting idea that two organ systems that are going to be rate limiting in age are the central nervous system and the immune system both of which are distributed. Where would you put the endothelium in that list as well? Right. The endothelium is also quite distributed across the organism and do you think that there's an inevitability to basically endothelial damage as a process of aging which of course results in the leading cause of death the the atherosclerotic diseases. Would you would you do you think of it the same way or do you think of it as different?

[00:07:44] It's not sort of defined as an organ by itself. It's a cell type but I agree with you has incredible importance uh and especially as it affects the you know the heart and the cardiovascular system and the brain. Um but I I think of of it as not so much as an organ but more as a sort of a principle that maintenance of barrier function. Yeah. and and not only in in the endthelium but also in the skin in the bloodb brain barrier are emerging as key areas to focus on if you want to maximize your longevity.

[00:08:19] Yeah, I I want to come back to this in great detail, Eric, but let's for the sake of summary and synthesis turn over to where you wanted to around metabolism. So metabolism is uh essential uh to life expectancy. If you look at uh and for a number of reasons and and um one of them I I'm convinced even though that theory has been somewhat discredited the whole oxidative stress theory of aging I still think oxygen is one of the major um major problems associated with the aging process. You know we have not been able to target the oxidative stress uh using antioxidant that has failed. It doesn't mean that the whole oxidative stress theory of aging is not valuable.

[00:09:07] I think living in an oxidative environment is really you know is is one of the mechanisms that leads to aging not the only one aging is pleomorphic. Um, so but just to make sure folks understand what you're saying, Eric, um, you're saying that, um, that the the generation of free radicals through oxygen, so I don't know how technical we want to get for people, but I I I think unfortunately we might need to get a little more technical and and apologies to those who don't want to go this deep, but but we have to talk about kind of what the role of the electrons are in oxygen and why uh, free radicals form and and what they do. So, so maybe we do go a little deeper here and explain what you're saying because it's a it's a it's a very important concept and I think we should probe it.

[00:09:50] Well, I I don't know how how much I mean maybe you you do a better job at at uh at explaining this in in a in for the lay lay person. I mean oxidative stress is the fact that um pretty much the main uh um metabolic reaction are dependent on oxygen uh which gives its electron. uh it's uh in in the so-called respiratory chain there is leakage in of these electrons that are traveling down this respiratory chain leakage at at specific places. You know if the process was 100% efficient the whole energy would be transferred from from metabolites such as uh fatty acid glucose and so on. But it turns out the the mechanism is is actually leaky.

[00:10:35] These electrons reacting with oxygen can generate these um byproducts called radical oxygen species which are highly reactive. Right? So they're not chemically stable the way we think of a normal atom of oxygen. No. And so they tend to react with proteins with fatty acid and they induce lesions. And we have a whole uh I mean the the the importance of this system in terms of um of protection against it is highlighted by the number of molecular system that we have that are actually protecting against this and and we know that as we age that leakage increases.

[00:11:14] Something about the integrity of the mitochondria and the respiratory electron transport chain degrades as we age and therefore we see more and more of this leakage. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. And so out of this came the whole idea well let's just suppress oxidative stress and you know there are chemicals even some as simple as vitamin

[00:11:36] E vitamin C that you could imagine that by chemical knowledge would be predictive to be able to quench these radical oxygen species. And so there a number of things so the idea sorry to just keep interrupting you but I we'll play off to each other to do this. So, so you eat for example an antioxidant and as you said it neutralizes that reactive oxygen species with its unstable electrons kind of like you would throw a blanket on a fire that's simmering.

[00:12:06] Exactly. And that was the hope. So um when the theory was proposed um a whole industry actually grew up out of this the whole antioxidant and the antioxidant diet and the uh you know the vitamins and so on. You can still by the way that that whole industry is still existing today. Sure does. Now um what happened is that when clinical trials were conducted in this area they failed and and so you know people who think relatively simply decided well the antioxidant failed therefore the theory has no validity and

[00:12:41] I would say not so fast because it turns out that these radical oxygen species also have important roles u they actually are inducing an inflammatory response which can be protective and a good example is uh during ex exercise. Uh there is some evidence of activation of oxidative stress during exercise and if you you know neutered this for example with anti-inflammatory you probably remember the data showing that anti-inflammatory drug tend to sort of suppress some of the beneficial effect of exercise. It's the same same whole idea. And so this is one case in which these um radical oxygen species can have um a a protective role and actually a a signaling role. So when you suppress it completely with these sort of global non-specific antioxidant essentially you not only killing the bad guys but you're also suppressing an important signaling mechanism. There's another hypothesis that I would offer which is is it possible that that there's a there's still a net negative to the free radicals. So there might be some benefits but more negatives but it could be that the trials were using agents that were simply ineffective because the problem is we don't have a great biioarker for the state of free radicals. So, it's sort of like saying,

[00:14:03] I have a hypothesis that this biological process is bad. I can't measure it really, but I think it's bad. I have a drug that I think will tamp it down. Let's give the drug the trial failed. Well, do you actually know if it tamped the thing down? Like, so you we don't even know if we tested the hypothesis.

[00:14:21] Correct. And so, those would be kind of two distinct plausibilities. I completely agree. And it's it's quite often the case is that I mean, the whole story of vitamin D is a good example. Absolutely. where where people are will tell you you know vitamin D doesn't work because they conducted clinical trials but they didn't you know fix they didn't adjust the dose they didn't measure the levels so it it's a bit the same the same story uh there are markers that you can uh actually do use in in research environment like five hydroxy noninol or protein carbonilation which are indirect markers of lipid or protein uh oxidation and how efficacious or beneficial or I guess the word is maybe um how complete are they in the scope of understanding and have we demonstrated that mega doses of vitamin E or vitamin

[00:15:08] C will indeed suppress those markers in humans? They're they're not great. They're not great. I had a colleague at the Bach Institute, Martin Brand, who is one of the leaders of the whole mitochondrial bio a field called bioenergetics, which is the study of how uh the respiratory chain and and and energy metabolism happens in mitochondria. And he came up with the idea that uh he identified uh many of the sites where these unique radical oxygen species are generated.

[00:15:36] And he was able to generate um specific inhibitors for each of the sites and and was able to show that actually u inhibition at some sites was beneficial while inhibition at other sites was not beneficial. And for so this pro project was actually supported by a pharma company which eventually decided to drop the the program um and he's retired which I think is a great loss because it is a whole program that needs that still needs to be uh pursued.

[00:16:06] So if I'm understanding what you said correctly Eric it sounds like there's a much more nuanced view. It's not that free radicals are bad and it's not that free radicals are good. It's like everything in biology. Uh it's the Goldilocks rule. You might need more of it during this circumstance in this part of the body. You might need less of it in this circumstance at this totally different part of the body. And as a result, any strategy that would try to globally suppress it could even if successful in doing it, which we haven't been able to measure, might actually not yield to a favorable outcome.

[00:16:42] Totally correct. Totally correct. And I I get frustrated by these types of the way that people sort of love to oversimplify or you know sort of erase whole fields. We've seen the and I I suspect we will get to talk about sertuins uh because the same thing has happened in the sertuins you know there's a lot of amazing work done and then a few negative results or things not working out. NAD metabolism, same thing. And I I always tell people, you know, once you get into any field of study and you go deep and you start testing in humans, um, put on your seat belt because it's not easy. And, uh, and there are no magic bullets. But I think, you know, stopping the study and saying the whole field is is BS is is really for me not the way to go. We got to keep dig deeper and eventually, you know, we'll get to that. So tell me what else within metabolism you think is kind of a hallmark of aging. So um we've obviously talked about the central part of metabolism which is respiration and ATP generation and the leakage that occurs there and and basically unfortunately that just appears to be inevitable. U yes that's totally right. We will never stop the oxygen in our environment. So yeah, um I do like to tell my patients that this is why I kind of harp on them to do a lot of zone 2 cardio training, right? So zone 2 very specifically by definition, right, is the canonical exercise you would do to maximize fat oxidation, which of course implies the most efficient use of the mitochondria.

[00:18:23] And the hypothesis, because I don't think, you know, we don't have proof of this, but the hypothesis is training at that level for specific periods of time throughout the week, is is a way to improve the health and function of your mitochondria, which would hopefully imply that you're reducing that degradation of function. Do you think there's validity to that? At least, you know, first order logic. Yeah, I mean I the proof is in the pudding pudding in a way that we know exercising and a combination of exercise is the best anti-aging intervention we have.

[00:18:58] But you think part of it is through that exact mechanism. Yeah. I mean that's that's been my hypothesis but again we can't fully glean that in in any human clinical trial. No. Hard to study. And I think you know your point allows me sort of to address your your question. What is it about metabolism that really so important? I think I'm convinced that it is fuel utilization and you mentioned you know fatty oxidation versus glycolysis and I'll add ketosis to this.

[00:19:25] I think if you think about um your metabolism is able to to oxidize a number of different substrates, amino acids, fatty acids, glucose and and ketones and lactate. and lactate and every one of those actually burns with different efficiency both being u car afficionado I think your audience probably knows also that you know there it's different to burn diesel or to burn 100 octane gas and you know if you look at that hierarchy I think ketones are probably the the cleanest fuel to burn in terms of again byproducts oxidative stress they seem to be really unique yeah how would you rank order from cleanest to dirtiest inclusive of lactate.

[00:20:11] Lactate I would not be able to to put it. I think it's probably clean. Yeah, I think my intuition is it is as well but it would be the top would be uh beta hydroxybutyrate. Beta hydroxybutyrate acettoacetate is is present at such low abundance it's probably not relevant as as a fuel fuel source. Then fatty acid next is the worst is actually glucose. And when you think about metabolism and aging, for me it goes to um a lot of the data that has emerged from um the ITP, for example, intervention testing program. This uh this

[00:20:45] Rich Miller has been on several times. I I watched your your recent podcast with uh Rich and and others. Um one of the remarkable thing when you look at the drugs that have seven or whatever 10 drugs that have emerged out of 80 y uh they are really targeting glucose metabolism and uh you know and and very via completely different mechanism.

[00:21:06] Think about a carbos which is blocking you know absorption of glucose. Think about the canosin which is you know targeting a protein has nothing to do links to protein glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Think about metformin which is you know but metformin failed. Yeah it failed but it it it's it seems to be having very powerful effect in terms of um um well it did not fail actually it failed unless it was paired with rapamy.

[00:21:32] Yes. And and in monkeys there's a study come coming out that showed that actually had an effect on lifespan. So and do you think rapamy has any impact on glucose metabolism favorably? general generally actually this isin is the the exception to this because it seems to be having some it it's not indifferent it it it has been claimed to be having an effect on uh insulin sensitivity um although although I'm not clear if that's true at the doses but anyway yeah we can come back to that

[00:22:02] I've taken rapamy I have not seen any effect on my blood sugar um now so think about you know a carbos canosine metformin u and not a GLP1 agonist which I I predict will emerge as juror protectors uh in the future. Um so I I think that's really speaks to an important aspect which is uh fuel utilization uh and how you know whether you're burning a clean fuel, whether you're burning a dirty fuel. Um you know we've put for example mice on a on a pure fat diet. These mice never saw a carbohydrate during their life and they lived longer which I thought was actually quite interesting.

[00:22:46] It is interesting Eric because a lot of the mouse literature um I think people don't read the fine print very closely and they don't notice that the typical thing you'll see is these mice were fed a highfat diet to induce obesity so that we could test you know drug A or C against obesity. But in those studies, it's not just a highfat diet. It's a highfat, high sugar diet. Right. So, they're making some insanely hyper palatable

[00:23:17] It's you know, the closest I can come up with is they're making a donut. Yes. Right. It's a fried dough, sugar food. And uh you know, so they're making basically donuts for these monkeys. And that's different than saying it's a highfat thing. So, so yeah, I think it's it's important to point out because, you know, a highfat minus the sugar might not be the same issue, right?

[00:23:40] Agree. At least in that model. Yeah. Um, so what do you think it is about glucose metabolism that that that leads to this? Because for all intents and purposes, um, let's just go through the metabolic pathways, right? So glucose, six carbons, it gets broken down into pyuvate. You get your two pyuvates for one glucose, right? And then pyuvate can it let's just assume we're doing this under aerobic conditions so we're not in a rush.

[00:24:11] We're going to take those pyuvates. Do they turn into acetal cos? I can't even remember to then enter the it's actually one pyrovate and that leads to enters the mitochondria and and becomes acetyl coa acetal. Okay. Okay. So what is it about that process that is not as efficient as when you are cleaving off carbons from a free fatty acid and those carbons are turning directly into uh I think just a straight acetal COA and then entering uh the KB cycle. What what what is the it's a very subtle difference. Why does why is one so much more inefficient?

[00:24:46] You mean why is there more calories per fatty acid or No no no that that can be explained by the stochometry. Why is one quote unquote dirtier? Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Um I I think obviously this is a really complicated question. So I I don't know that I would be able to really tell you purely as fuels whether there is a difference. I think the biggest difference is in terms of the the the whole mechanism that they elicit. And when we think about glucose, I don't think necessarily of it if you were to study it in in a tissue culture dish that one would be toxic more toxic than the other. I don't think there's any evidence for this but glucose and particularly the form of glucose that we have not evolved to actually be exposed to which is all the wheat products you know this fast form of glucose um elicits insulin secretion and I think insulin and IGF-1 but particularly insulin is the culprit in this whole process. So you're not saying that one mole of glucose, one mole of free fatty acid. We know there's a difference in

[00:25:53] ATP generation, but you're not saying that there's a difference, assuming they're both going through the mitochondria. You're not saying there's a difference in free radical formation, mole per mole, or are you saying that it's this way? There's another way to explain it, which is per mole of ATP, you need to run so much more glucose through that, of course, you're going to get more leakage. Well, the the key difference is that um the glucose is generating ATP not only via acetyl coa and pyrovate but is also generating ATP in the intracellular intracytoplasmic components. The fatty acids do not generate in the so I suspect that there might be a difference in terms of the amount of free radicals that are that are generated. Um I there is evidence but I I would not be able to site you the paper that one cleans one burns clean more cleanly than the other and I suspect it's partly the cytoplasmic component of of glucose.

[00:26:51] It's also less efficient um in terms of the amount you know of energy that's being generated per gram of fatty acid or per mole of fatty acid versus per mole of of glucose. And then going back to the insulin IGF component here, what role do you think they're playing? Critical. Um because epidemiologically and and and through studies, we know that the um insulin response to your glucose. So if you do a lot of sports, I tell I I I I'm not a proponent of the low carbohydrate or no carbohydrate diet because there's there's very little evidence that those diets are actually beneficial. You know, I gave you the example of a ketogenic diet which we did experimentally, but these are not practical diet for anyone just because the of the challenge in avoiding carbohydrates in the standard world we live in.

[00:27:44] Yes, I would say both socially, palatably, I mean there's so many reasons. I I I went on a ketogenic diet. I I from what I remember, I think you you went too. I did for three years. I was on a ketogenic diet. So, we should compare notes. Yeah. Um because I want to I want to hear your experience and then I want to ask you a couple questions about it.

[00:28:04] It was very hard. How long did you do it? Uh for a couple of years and I did not feel super healthy which is really kind of interesting. Um you know I I found it sort of socially isolating. I didn't did and so we you know we've worked actually to remedy this on we can talk about this later on on a novel keto keto um like a ketone or ketoester. Exactly. Of beta hydroxybutyrate. Um so going back to um the role of insulin um there is a lot happening in terms of you know that's been documented that the intensity so first your average glucose plays a role average blood glucose this is measured by hemoglobin A1C um in a whole series of complication cardiovascular as you know um but perhaps more important is the intensity of your peaks And uh and I think you know the intensity of the peaks of insulin is a reflection of your glucose intake fast absorbing glucose and that has been from that's the reason why we advocate advocate people to you know go on a CGM continuous glucose monitor and to really learn to understand what spikes them. The whole idea is to mitigate these peaks of insulin secretion.

[00:29:23] I'm just going to play this for all of our patients because we we have this discussion with every one of our patients. So it'll be nice to just play this video and let you do the talking. The whole idea there is to again to mitigate these peaks um and either dietary or you know for example the the GLP1 agonists are playing a role in this.

[00:29:45] Yeah. Well let's talk about this because there is at least for me a great deal of confusion around this point. Now we um we we understand today the role that the gut plays in metabolism and we understand that a lot of it is transduced through GLP1. So endogenous production of GLP-1 uh according to Ralph Def Franszo the world's authority on this is what's driving 80% of beta cell activity with respect to insulin and therefore when we have GLP when we have insulin resistance we can't the GLP1 we're making is insufficient to generate the insulin that's required to to to manage the glucose makes sense if that's the case that giving exogenous GLP1. You take a shot of tzepide or semiglutide, you're going to put more GLP-1 in the system. You're going to overcome the resistance at the beta cell. You make more insulin. You now have better glucose control. Everybody wins.

[00:30:51] Now, it's not clear that that has anything to do with the weight side of it and that that that's a separate issue and I want to actually talk about that because there are two very interesting theories as to why these things cause weight loss. But point here is, wouldn't you expect to see higher levels of insulin in someone taking a GLP-1 agonist to achieve that better glycemic control?

[00:31:13] Yes. And and that's not what you see. Um so I and I don't have an answer for this. Um but I' I've I've seen the same thing. I've seen the same thing. U including personally I've been experimenting with toatite. Uh my insulin is five now which is you know lowest that you can possibly get it. Um and I was expect I was there was a part of me that was worried that I was going to go against my my own whole theory about you know have you checked postprandially. Have you done an oral glucose tolerance test where you look at because that might be something to do um to see what is happening to postprandial um insulin along with postprandial glucose which of course will be better. No, I haven't.

[00:31:58] That that would be an interesting test to do. Yeah. And it I I've worn a CGM. Uh my A1C has gone from 5.4 5.5 to 5.0. Yep. And my insulin is down to 5.0 as well. So, and did you lose any weight? I lost a little bit of weight. Not a huge amount, six or seven pounds, which was never the goal not to start with. It was the whole idea was and and no loss of muscle mass which actually is the big uh the big um booaboo that you know people will have you fear no loss of muscle mass if you are exercising if you are so for me it's an experiment it's not I haven't decided this is something

[00:32:39] I'm going to continue but I just wanted to really experiment for myself to try to see okay what is this drug really doing and it's it's been nothing short of remarkable I think in some way um uh one of the most surprising has And for me, this feeling of satiety. Um, you know, you hear about satiety. I I was never in my whole life the type of person that felt full. I could always eat more. And and all of a sudden after about two weeks on this, I just looked at my plate. I said, I'm full. And I heard myself saying this and I just felt like, wow, this is really completely different. And for me, you know, the reason why I'm excited about these drugs is um, and by the way, this is not an endorsement. This is something to this.

[00:33:21] Yeah. Yeah. This is self-experimentation. Self experimentation which is a a long part of the tradition of our field which I I love and the whole idea is really to um for me the the thinking was one of the the biggest advance in longevity medicine is this idea that a range is meaningless. And and as a practicing phys physician you know this.

[00:33:47] You know, I went to medical school and we were told that, you know, your blood pressure has to be, you know, 130 over 90 and that was a normal range. So, you could be 128 over, you know, 88 and you were still considered normal. The same thing I went to see my personal physician and told him, you know, my blood sugar is creeping up every year that I'm doing it and now it's 96 fasting blood sugar and I'm worried because soon I'm going to be pregnant.

[00:34:12] And he said, it's below 100. It's okay. He told me, you're normal, don't worry. And I told him, I said, "What is normal?" And I think this is um this really is where I think longevity medicine is going to make an important impact is really sort of revisit. I I can't tell you how many times I've had this argument with people about glucose. Um and there and and here's the funny thing. We have the literature, in other words, we have literature in non-diabetics, your A1C that says the lower the A1C, the lower the all-c cause mortality. It's a monotonic reduction that knows no lower limit.

[00:34:48] I'm with you. So, so we say that up to 5.6 is normal. And if you're at 5.6, you're fine. And 5, but but 5.5 is better than 5.6. And 5.4 is better than 5.5. And five is better than 5.4. And 4.8 is better than 5.1. I'm not there yet. Yeah. Yeah. But my point is, uh, I also find it um I don't know what the word is. Maybe sad. I find it sad that we've we've simplified this problem uh in in an effort to to communicate but have lost the essence of where where is lower better uh because it's not always true in biology right it's not you know when you look at TSH for example when you look at thyroid hormone much more narrow band in which we would say there's optimal um and lower is not you know if it's too low or too high it's problematic but it turns out that when it comes to average blood glucose in you know, non-type type 1 diabetic or someone who's taking insulin. Um, under natural physiological circumstances, it's it's just better to be lower. Um, and as you age, it just keeps creeping up.

[00:35:52] Same thing for blood pressure. Yes. You know, they're they're revisiting the number every 5 years in terms of making it lower. You know, I think if your blood pressure is a 105 over 65, you're better off than if you're 115 over 70. That's right. Provided you're not symptomatic, lower is always better. And so I think it's um uh you know I'm frustrated but I'm also excited by the fact that this is now becoming uh the norm in a whole new field of physicians who are more aware of what what actually what is health and and the same for your weight. You know we know that it's a J I mean that's the thing that I is really interesting in the whole aging field is this idea that everything is a J curve.

[00:36:35] So there there's um there's a sweet spot where you want to be and quite often it's broad enough that you can maneuver this in a way to optimize people's health. What do you think is the relationship between I mean body weight is so crude but maybe we can even talk about it through atyposity body fat and and longevity uh once correcting for metabolic health.

[00:36:57] So, it's it's obvious that so much of the relationship we see between body fat and poor health is really just a proxy for something that's harder to measure, which is metabolic health. It's very easy to measure body fat. And we estimate body fat from BMI. And so, that's why we have all these population data from BMI. But as if you have the luxury of working with actual patients, you you I don't know. I couldn't tell you the BMI of one person I take care of, but I know everybody's body fat, everybody's visceral fat, and everybody's oral glucose tolerance test.

[00:37:27] So we we we know what we what we know and we know what matters. Um are you convinced that atyposity per se is problematic or do you believe that a person can have excess body fat but be metabolically healthy and confer the same longevity benefit as a metabolically healthy lean person? I mean we know there are people who are o considered overweight who are metabolically healthy.

[00:37:58] Yes. Um I mean easily 20% in my experience. Yes. And I am not where I I think it that's these are facts. No one can dispute them. You can be overweight and metabolically healthy. What I worry about is that is the long-term effect. Do you mean from an orthopedic perspective? with the other complications that come from excess weight or are you saying that that they're basically increasing their probability of eventually going off the metabolic slide?

[00:38:28] Both. M I I I and I honestly I don't know what the data says but uh my worry would be that you might be metabolically looking healthy when you're 40 but if you sustain this for 20 years you know clearly visceral fat yeah different category is highly predictive of everything u the other thing I'll say also the BMI itself is a is a my BMI is at the border of being overweight

[00:38:55] I am overweight by BMI I think I'm four by four pounds If I if I lost four pounds, I would get down to a BMI of 25. And I have 11% body fat. So I I I don't worry about it because I know, you know, all in all, I'm metabolically healthy. My numbers are good and all this. So in some way, yes, it's it's it's not a particularly helpful I mean, it serves its purpose at the population level, but it it can't be used to make a decision about an individual at all.

[00:39:21] Exactly. But it can also sometimes you know become a confounding variables when people do studies and they use these numbers and they they make predictions or they draw conclusions that are really not based on the fact that that high BMI fraction of the population is heterogeneous in terms of metabolic health. I think this is really where um so my colleagues at the buck uh Nathan

[00:39:45] Price and Lee Hood have actually published a paper. Wait, I didn't realize they were at the Buck. Yeah, both of them. They were up in Seattle before, weren't they? Yes, we recruited both of them actually in the last two years. Congratulations. Yeah, thank you. I think this is transformative for us. Fantastic. Very exciting.

[00:40:00] Um Lee U is still partially in Seattle, so he's partially at the buck, but he's brought you know, we we've established a collaboration with Phenom Health and Nathan was at Thorne and still a cso at Thorne, but a fac full, you know, faculty member at the back. So I think it and they're really helping us to do something really exciting along these lines. For example, they they had a paper describing this um uh uh uh BMI but bio biochemical BMI based on biological markers that essentially assess you know your metabolic status.

[00:40:36] So I think that's you know those tools are are available and it's a question of educating the physician. And do you know what makes up that biological BMI? No, but I I'll give you the paper. So, okay, we spent a little more time on metabolism than we did immune uh health and the immune system overall. I'd actually like to go back and talk about it a little bit more. Um I think again the listeners of this podcast are very familiar with the metabolic stuff. We haven't had as many discussions on the immune system. Um talked about it at length uh with respect to cancer. Uh had

[00:41:12] Steve Rosenberg on a few years ago. That was a fantastic discussion explaining the role of the immune system in cancer, which I think we're going to have to talk about here because I mean, I certainly feel convinced that a big part of why cancer incidence goes up uh exponentially with age is the declining immune system, not just the accumulation of mutations, although I I imagine they both play a role. Um, but I will tell you something else, Eric, which is uh, you know, I wrote a book a couple of years ago about this space. And in the book, I talk about these things called the four horsemen. And I described them as the the four things that are basically coming for us all. If you out if you manage to outlive youth, right?

[00:41:53] So if you're, you know, this is not to diminish the role of trauma and other things that are that are that are that are deadly. But but for many people living in OECD nations, it's going to come down to ASCVD, cancer, dementing and neurodeenerative diseases and metabolic diseases. And people often say, Peter, is there anything you wish you'd written in the book that you would if you go back in time you would do? And

[00:42:15] I say, yeah, there there are probably many things if I thought about it, but the first thing that jumps out is I really should have added a fifth horseman. and that is immune health and the types of infections that ravage people in old age that a young person wouldn't even laugh at or would laugh at. Right. So, thank you for bringing this up because we you know the imunology field somewhat um immunology and aging have been uh not really mixing very well. One one problem is that imunology is an extremely complex and advanced field probably one of the along with neuroscience one of the most complex. Um so when you go to an aging meeting there is no one talking about imunology. You go to imunology meeting there are very few people talking about aging. Um and we try to navigate even the nomenclature is is being used differently. You know people in in imunology talk about imunosiness meaning aging of the immune system. They don't mean scinessence the way we talk about it in the aging field. Interesting. So that yields all kinds of crazy communication problems.

[00:43:21] Yeah. Because if you're in the aging field then you hear immunosiness you think of SASPs and things that are being secreted by te- cells. It just means aging of the immune system. Um now the reason why I think this is u a tragic failing for for both field is what happened during covid. It was became obvious that you know being infected was not you know your risk of infection was not linked to your age.

[00:43:47] The virus infected everyone across but the outcome could be completely different with 84 excess 84fold excess mortality if you were above 75. 84fold. Now you know when this happened um and we can go in in terms of trying to understand why why did this happen? what are the the reasons for this? Um I I went and started to look at the literature. Um influenza, it's exactly the same thing. RSV, same thing. So all of these viruses that are, you know, that you can contract in later years will kill you, you know, with really significant rates. You know, influenza,

[00:44:25] I think 30,000 people die every year from influenza. um you know the mortality in terms of um uh COVID was really highly segregated into the older part of the population or in that part of the population that showed accelerated aging, obesity and so on. So I think there's a there's a lot there. Do you think that that most of the um mortality any any time we saw a gap in mortality whether it was young versus old whether it was obese versus non-obese diabetic versus non-diabetic cuz we're any anytime you looked at that you saw a difference in mortality do you believe that it was always a difference in immune function I mean with young versus old it's very obvious but do you think that was also true in the other coorbidities?

[00:45:09] Yes. Yeah. would say so and it it comes from two two reasons. One is you know there are two broad immune system the what we call the innate and the adaptive immune system. I don't know if you want me to I would I actually was going to say I think it is worth going full boore on this. I think it is time for people to roll up their sleeves and understand arguably the most interesting system in the human body. I am biased. I I spent two years at the NCI doing immunology, but I think this is such an interesting field.

[00:45:40] Yeah. So, our immune system is is built to recognize foreign elements. That's really is why it evolved. It has two lines of defense against microbes, bacteria, viruses, fungi, all of those. We are constantly bombarded by those. It is actually amazing because I mean the evidence of this is if your immune system doesn't function, the bubble compatible with life compatible with life. So we are u you know we're colonized with bacteria in and out on our skins everywhere. So we constantly respond to them in an appropriate manner and we survive everything including disruptions to the barriers.

[00:46:19] Absolutely. Absolutely. And so we have two lines of defense in the immune system. First the so-called innate immune system which is your macrofasages your dendritic cells but also pretty much every cell has a whole series of mechanism that are uh not pathogen specific that is they will recognize an intruder be it a virus be it a fungi be it bacteria and they will activate a first line of defense. those line of defenses are non-specific and therefore they're less effective um and they give time to the so-called adaptive immune system which is the second part which is made up of T- cells and B cells and both of those cells have highly selective defense mechanism the B cells make antibodies which will go uh recognize a bacteria or or a fungus or or a virus and and and the tea cells which are able to actually kill the infected self itself. So it will recognize when the cell is colonized by a foreign uh pathogen and will uh will kill it. Um so the you know the time course of these is that you know once you get you encounter a pathogen you will be activate your innate immune response.

[00:47:41] Typically you know it can be fever it can be all kinds of symptoms but activation of this defense and this gives the whole organism a couple of weeks to actually build the defense for the specific uh that will specifically recognize this organism. Um let's talk a little bit let's talk a little bit about memory within that system.

[00:48:01] The the beauty of the adaptive so the DNA immune system does not really have a me a true memory. It will always react in the same way no matter how many times you you you encounter the so the same you get if you if you get the same vir so if your if your kids are pingponging the same respiratory virus at you from school yes your innate immune system has the same playbook. Yes.

[00:48:23] Fever. Uh you're going to get red. You're going to like whatever inflamation. Yeah. You're going to get sore. All of those things are going to happen regardless. Exactly. Yeah. Um and that's in contrast to the adaptive immune system because once the initial response has been generated either via an infection or a vaccination, this is what a vaccination is. It presents you with a given fra fraction or the whole virus or a part of it. your body will mount a response and this will yield um this will lead to the amplification of a subset of cells that are selective. So think about your either your T- cells or your B cells none of them are the same.

[00:49:04] We have a process by which we generate so-called diversity which is um billions of different forms of antibodies or T- cell receptors that are recognizing in principle every chemical structure or every protein from from a microorganism. Now what happens during the initial encounter either be a vaccination or an infection is those B cells or those T- cells that have a receptor that is able to recognize the pathogen will become amplified and they will turn out large amount of the antibbody or or or the T- cell clones once the job has been done they will contract but it will not contract back down to the same level, they will become what we call memory T cells or memory B cells. So that if you encounter the same antigen in the future, the reactivation process is shortened, the maturation happens faster. So eventually that's the whole idea of the vaccination is to sort of get yourself ready with a a subset of memory T- cell clones or B cell clones that once the the true uh virus will come you will be able to mount a response within a few days or or up to a week. And so that's how vaccination works. Now what's interesting during aging is and people are not aware of this uh if you're above 70 uh most vaccinations do not work and so people then will ask they actually your immune system has aged and your vaccination rate really decreases very strongly from what I remember this might be different in different populations but the vaccination rate success is close to 30% if you're above 70 now what would during COVID. What was the risk reduction for a person over 75 who was vaccinated versus not vaccinated? Oh, it was almost complete reversal of of the effect in terms of the protection, meaning it was highly highly protective.

[00:51:13] Yeah, it was it was protective. So, how how do we reconcile those two facts? That's true. Um, and I don't know to be honest, I don't know how this has been studied. Um I don't know. Uh I I I would be happy to to to read about this. Okay. How because the COVID vaccine seems to have had a remarkable risk reduction in very old people. Didn't didn't seem to have an impressive risk reduction in younger people. Uh because the absolute risk was so low, it didn't seem to matter that much. But boy did it matter in older people. But did it matter by at the population level or at the individual level? This is what I'm not sure about.

[00:51:59] I don't I I certainly don't want to go on record saying something that I don't but my recollection Yeah. I mean we we you know I I think we can find the answer and put it in the show notes. My recollection uh which could be wrong is that the older a person got the greater the benefit they got from co vaccines. um with respect to mortality. Um so I guess the question is let's maybe talk about other vaccines. Is that not the case with influenza? Is that not the case with Numacus or any of the other vaccines that are used primarily in older adults in in general? um at least and I'm not a a vaccine specialist but uh the the thinking is that um there's a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of vaccination against influenza against

[00:52:54] RSV against all of those as you age. Um the thinking then is how how does it work at the population level and this is where the whole concept of her immunity uh works is that if you limit the spread of the infection in a family for example you're le much less likely to infect grandpa who who is you know who will

[00:53:13] I see I see so that that's been my understanding of how most of these viruses u these yeah I'm asking a different question that's an important question I guess I was asking the obviously they didn't probably do a randomized control trial. So you've got all these confounders in it, but I wonder if they just looked at all comers to the hospital, vaccinated versus non, let's try to control for all the confounders. If the hazard ratio is 1.2, it means nothing or eight. But if the hazard ratio was, you know, 0.2 or eight, well, you'd say even with the confounders, there must be some high degree of protection that came from that. Uh, so anyway, I'm sure someone listening to this knows the answer to that. We'll try to find the answer and put it in the show notes. But, um, so let's go back to the why, right? Why is it that as a person ages, they're less likely to respond to a vaccination? Is it because a their immune system, the adaptive immune system is less able to recognize the foreign pathogen and build up a high enough reserve of T- cells and

[00:54:21] B cells that will respond? or is it B that they can do that but the ability for those cells to stay in a memory state and be reactivated is somehow impaired. I think it's both uh as in everything in aging aging is um but there's one aspect which is uh really unique at least in terms of T- cell which are really instrumental in terms of most vaccine response is the fact that these TE cells are generated by the thymus and the thymus uh a small organ behind the the sternum.

[00:54:59] How big is your thymus and my thymus right now? I don't I I'm 68 so it's probably very very embionic and there's probably not much left. So after age 50 in most people you find it um very small. Now the the whereas it when you're young it's a it's actually you can see it on an imaging study and I I would imagine if you and I had a CT scan of the chest you'd barely be able to pick it up.

[00:55:23] Exactly. And it's replaced by fat actually in most people as you age. Um although there is some somewhat controversial evidence that there might still be some clones that can be reactivated even in older people and and human growth hormone as you know is one of the the the the intervention that has been shown to actually reinduce thyogenesis.

[00:55:46] So let's let's talk about that a little bit. Are you referring to that fee paper from about seven or eight years ago that looked at growth hormone with metformin and DHEA or something like that? That's one. But that fee paper was actually um inspired by work of a colleague of mine when I was at the Glatstone Institute um who um uh did this actually Mike McHugh and colleagues did this in patients with

[00:56:13] HIV uh who are chronically infected with HIV where they lose a lot of their CD4T cells and there was an interest in trying to see if you could actually and so there's a big lesion initially in infection And there was um uh an attempt to actually try to see if you could regenerate these populations to bring them back to a normal because even though we had great drugs against HIV, they could not bring those patients back to normal. There was a remaining sort of original insult. So they did a trial u uh with uh human growth hormone that were able to show some degree of uh thyogenesis and and increase in naive tea cells in in these patients and I believe the fee trial u actually tried to reproduce this. I think there's a second fee trial that is ongoing or but

[00:57:06] I haven't seen the results. Yeah, I mean the first one was I I don't remember the results, but the cocktail was a little suspect. So the GH made sense if that's your hypothesis. I believe I've never spoken with Greg, but I believe reading the trial. The metformin, which was really given at a homeopathic useless dose, I think it was only given at 500, so apologies if it wasn't, but I think it was only given at 500, was meant to offset the glucose metabolism disturbances of GH. Do you remember why the DHEA was given?

[00:57:41] No, there was some reason for it that uh made sense on paper but didn't make sense sort of physiologically. Now the more important question is if if my my take on that trial was it was a single active agent which was growth hormone like I don't think DHEA does anything. I don't think 500 metformin does anything. So the question is and it was a very small trial and I think it was open label and I have I have a significant problem with the readout of that that trial.

[00:58:08] So that's what I want to ask you about. Remind me of the readout. The readout was uh one of the clocks. Ah that's right. This was Steve Horvath was the other author on that. Exactly. and and um and actually this is this whole story sort of pushed us into a whole project that we've published down on on what we call entry clock um because there was indeed in the experiment um they in the patients they indeed observed some increase in na in the fraction of naive tea cells which tells you and me that something worked the fraction of naive tea cells increased um with respect to the memory tea cells, the naive tea cells are the ones that are generated in the thymus.

[00:58:54] They are they're naive because they have never met their cognate antigen and they sit there waiting for something to happen. So the whole idea of treating with human growth hormone was to induce thyogenesis and to restore the pool of these naive tea cells. So I think to some degree it worked at low level. uh then they used the clock uh on the whole blood and my worry uh when I saw the paper which is a worry that actually existed predated this u was also a worry when people were using tome tie length is the idea when you sample the blood as an iminologist I know this is a highly dynamic uh organ think about the blood as an organ we enumerate at this point today with the best technology more than 500 different populations of cells in the blood. Suppose that these cells vary in response to any intervention and that these cells individually have a different epigenetic age. You would have the impression that you are rejuvenating, you know, which is was the claim of that fee paper that they had rejuvenated people. But in effect, what you would do is simply change.

[01:00:05] Yeah. It's like you're on a sine wave that goes like this and you take two sample points. They could be here. They could be here. They could be here. You don't. And by the way, as you probably know, Matt Camberlin has famously purchased, I think, four or five of the commercially available aging clocks.

[01:00:22] He bought them in duplicate and did all of them, sampled them all simultaneously. Right? So, two of this, two of this, two of this, two of this simultaneously. Take 10 samples. And not only do all the clocks disagree with each other, but even within the same clock, there was disagreement. significant disagreement. Um, so yeah, I mean I want to actually come back and talk about clocks in in some detail, but given that that study was done years ago with an older clock, I I think the clock part of it is not even remotely interesting. I think the more interesting question is was there was there genuine thyic regeneration? If so, how do we reconcile a very pressing and vexing question within neuroscience, which is the role of growth hormone? Right? So, I've never taken growth hormone. I've never I shouldn't say I've never prescribed it.

[01:01:13] I've prescribed it in very rare circumstances for injury uh healing. Um but I've never prescribed it for quote unquote longevity benefits. But a lot of people are out there doing so. And as such, I've had lots of patients who come to my practice who have been taking or are on growth hormone. And I will say this to a person, every single one of them has said, "I feel so much better when I take growth hormone than when I do not." I mean, across the board, 100%.

[01:01:43] And I can't actually point to evidence that tells them it's bad to take. I can just sort of say it doesn't make sense to take if our goal is to reduce the risk of cancer and if our goal is to slow the aging process. Um so what is your take on that? Just just your intuition uh or is there any data you're aware of that would would lead one to think that well maybe we could pulse a little bit of growth hormone here and there if we get some thymic regeneration. We don't have to be on it all the time. I mean how would you think about that? I do worry about it for I'm not a specialist on growth hormone itself. Um it induces diabetes.

[01:02:25] It induces glucose intolerance. So from that angle I'm do worry about what it would do chronically especially in someone young. For me I really it's a bit like uh increasing your protein intake. um if you are you know there's a clear evidence that increasing your protein intake especially as you age becomes beneficial and the people who have higher protein intake um uh actually do better in terms of muscle mass and so on. So in someone uh who is 65 to 70 who is starting to feel you know uh the effect of or manifest some form of psychopenia there might be a benefit for that person to actually increase muscular mass and and all the benefits with this especially if it's not done continuously but but I mean I would argue there's no doubt that there's benefits but you're going to get far more efficacy from testosterone or anabolic steroids when it comes comes to mitigating sarcopenia.

[01:03:25] Growth hormone actually is not remarkable at inducing muscle mass. It's nowhere near as effective um as testosterone. It's more effective at um eliciting fat loss. But I wonder if there's something that goes beyond that because I I think when when people tell me they feel better on it, I think they're talking about like less aches and pains. Like just joints just feel better. I don't think anybody's saying they feel better because their thymus is more plump, but I wonder if like that to me would be a reason to potentially consider a schedule, you know, an intermittent schedule of something if it's again going back to my macro thesis here, which is I've been harping on these four horsemen, four horsemen.

[01:04:08] Well, if we introduce a fifth horsemen, what is the strategy? because I can give you chapter in verse the strategy for how you will mitigate heart disease, cancer, all of these other conditions. What is our strategy for mitigating immune decline? I would say the same as as a strategy that would mitigate decline in every other organ, you know, and there's clear evidence that people ex the effect of exercise on on on immunology is the same as in every single

[01:04:37] So, I'm not familiar with it. So, tell tell me a little bit about that. I don't know specifically how how exercise impacts the immune system. I don't know that you know I cannot speak to specific papers but I mean clearly um there's evidence that people who exercise actually respond to infection better uh you know respond to vaccination better. So that that's all been documented. I cannot speak to the specific studies but there is do you have a sense of mechanistically why that's the case? It is so complex I would say I I would not be able to to tell you. But that being said,

[01:05:11] I think the whole the whole line of investigation to induce uh uh thyic uh uh rejuvenation I think is an important one area especially if we thinking about increasing lifespan you know further for what we are doing now that in the future it will become one of these rate limiting step. It's a bit the same situation as the ovary where you know these are the ovary and the and the thymus are we call them the canary and the coal mine. I mean there really are specific organs that show accelerate aging way earlier than than other than other tissues. Now the question is you know why is the thymic involuting so early? Um I think it's probably because evolutionary we were never meant to live this old and um and and so that that really is one of the thinking that that goes on that's going to be in the long term one of the problems that we have to face and and this is something we're actively studying in the lab is trying to we just completed a study uh where we are looking for novel biomarkers that are predictive of whether you will respond to a vaccination or not and this is something done in collaboration Mark

[01:06:20] Davis at Stanford using the 10,00 immunome project which is one of the largest studies studying aging in the immune system only only in humans and and so we've been able to uh studying people to identify some metabolites that are associated with poor response to vaccine and so those are not only markers but they could also become uh tools that we include in as aduvent or as a as a pre pre-treatment theory I'm sure you're familiar with the the work of Joan Manik Of course. Yeah, I was going to ask you about manic and click scene in a moment, but before we do, I want to go back to this point here, which is um you know, biomarkers are so important.

[01:07:02] And when I think about cardiovascular disease, uh and even though it's the leading cause of death, why I tell my patients it's the one you need to be least afraid of if you're willing to be proactive in management. And it comes down to the fact that we just have such a clear understanding of how the disease works and we have exceptional biomarkers, right? So we we can measure the things that are causing the disease.

[01:07:28] We can measure inflammation. We can measure apo. We can measure VLDLDL cholesterol, LP little A. We also we can measure blood pressure. We can measure metabolic health. And we know how to address those things. And we know that when we address those things, we can measure whether what we're doing is working. Okay, so problem solved basically. Um, when it comes to the immune system, let's we're going to talk about Manic and Clickstein in a moment. But as we saw from their paper 10 years ago, um they gave a rapamy analog to people uh people who were in their 60s, vaccinated them and demonstrated that oh boy, you got a much better immune response. Okay, they were able to demonstrate that using laboratory techniques. I'm sure they used flowcytometry or something like that to measure it. Um, how close are we to being able to do that sort of thing commercially?

[01:08:27] By commercially I mean uh over the counter like uh not close I think in in that study they actually measured antibbody tighters. So even more complicated than flowcytometry. Yes. Okay. And so um in that case they definitely showed an enhancing effect with a a known uh you know juror protector. This was a suspected jur protector at least in humans. We exactly a rapid log and they showed uh not only um increased tighters but also protection increased protection.

[01:09:03] Eventually the the clinical trial failed for a whole series of other reasons which were in part due to the way that the the the FDA imposed the trial to be generated. I think it just complicated the whole picture. Yeah. By the way, for folks listening to us who are confused by that, um Matt Camberlin and I had a specific discussion because it wasn't the 2014 trial. It was a later trial where they it wasn't the RAD 001 trial. It was the

[01:09:33] It was the other trial that failed. Uh and I actually don't remember the reason, but but Matt Matt explained it. It was very clear that it was a tragedy of bureaucracy. It is. And um and it shouldn't be viewed as a black eye on that molecule. Yeah. And u I think you know Matt is more of a specialist in the whole rappering. So we'll defer to what he said, but we'll we'll link in the show notes to where that to to where Matt and I had that discussion.

[01:10:00] Yeah. my inter my what I've heard from anyone that I've talked to including Joan is that this was uh in some way bungled which which is sad because sometimes things like this can put a field back for you know a number of years and discourage investors. We have a um a startup that originated at the buckle which has raised $50 million again coming up with rapologues novel rapaloges that are going to be I think revisiting that whole that whole picture. Uh, so we're quite excited. The field is is far from being dead.

[01:10:32] Will we ever be able to measure this in people the way we measure hemoglobin A1C or things like that? Or is it going to be one of those things where it's a bit of a leap of faith and you're going to have to look at the clinical trial where the outcome was there? And then you're just going to have to say, well, even though there was probably massive heterogeneity amongst the participants in the trial, we're going to dose this thing individually. I mean, it's a little bit like, you know, you brought up vitamin D earlier. I mean, one of the problems with the vitamin D trials is that they're all garbage, right? Because they all just give people a given dose.

[01:11:05] They don't measure the response. They don't measure compliance. A vitamin D trial should be done based on target level, not target dose. And so we we run the risk here of the same thing in a much more complicated system. Agree. Uh that being said, measuring pathogen specific titers is done routinely in the clinic by you know I I don't know if you did this but I just had my uh measles tighter measured because I'm I'm was born in 1957 which is right the age at which before 1957 everyone was um exposed to measles. So you are typically uh safe and but you should measure your tighter to determine whether you need to be revaccinated and uh and I I found out that yeah you can do this very easily. You get a tighter would the tighters by themselves tell you? So what would you predict? So if if

[01:12:02] I if I measured every tighter right now, if I measured polio, shingles, did a pan tighter on you and then started you on rapamy for eight weeks and then stopped it and then reme-measured your titers without vaccinating you, what would you expect to see? I would not expect them to change. Yeah, exactly. So how do we know we're improving your immune system if indeed we have?

[01:12:26] Oh, you or I see what you're saying. So in terms of uh if we were to start you on rapamy what would happen? So how could we measure the improvement in immune function? By the way the uh the manic trial showed that when you vac you first they did a a one month treatment with the rapidog before vaccination. So this was uh they demonstrated not an effect on existing vaccination but only demonstrated on denovo vaccination. And I think um you know what would be the effect on existing titers against all of the other pathogen? I don't know. I mean I don't think this have ever been done.

[01:13:07] Yeah. Interesting. Um let you want to just say a little bit more about that trial. So that was at least for me a that was that was a very pivotal moment in my journey in this uh uh in this space and in understanding this world. So that was December of 2014 that that paper came out and uh if I recall roughly 300 plus participants divided into four groups. So placebo group, a group that got 1 milligram every day, a group that got 5 milligrams once a week and a group that got 20 milligrams once a week. Uh so two two people were pulsed uh one much higher than the other and then one given daily and then a placebo.

[01:13:45] I believe they were all over 65. I think the study was done in Australia and as you said they were um put on their whatever treatment was for four weeks immunized I think it was another four weeks and then a six week wash out and then the titers were checked and the best response I think was in the 5 mgram pulse and the 20 milligram pulse. The 1 milligram daily still had a better response than the placebo but not as strong as the two pulse doses. But the five and the 20 weekly were nearly identical, but the 20 had much more side effects. So I think that and again I I don't remember perfectly, so correct me if I'm wrong pretty well. Uh the takeaway was basically 5 milligram pulse was the sweet spot. You get all the benefit without the side effects.

[01:14:34] Reason why No, I I think that's that's how I remember that trial as well. Although I'm I'm always impressed by how you remember the all of the details of these clinical trials. Uh what was remarkable about that data was the fact that um this is from a drug that is supposed to be an immune suppressant immunosuppressant and you know it's been a long road for the longevity field to try to get our colleagues who are actually using uh rapamy as an imunosuppressant to have to to have them believe that um this actually has an effect on immunity and not only not imunosuppress suppressive but actually promoting immunity. So how do you reconcile that?

[01:15:15] Uh meaning not not not not their disbelief which is warranted but how do you reconcile that one molecule can be if if given so if you think about the doses we used to give rapamy it's not actually used that much by the way um today in um in in in the in the uh transplant clinic. Uh so so FK506 uh Cerolamus has largely pardon me um uh no no no I'm blanking on what FK506's real name is but anyway whatever it's it's largely displaced uh seramus which is RAPA but that said when we used to give it out we were giving 2 to four milligrams a day.

[01:15:55] Yeah. Now let's just assume that it was indeed contributing to prevention of organ rejection. Do you think it was doing so because that's a high enough dose of constitutively giving a drug that it suppresses the immune system or do you think it was only suppressing the immune system because it was given being it was being given in combination with two other drugs and it was only as part of that sea of other drugs that it has the imunosuppressive effects. No, I I think there's clear evidence it is imunosuppressive by itself and I can tell you that for the period when I was on rapamy um I would take either four or six milligrams a week every morning. So once a week so that the biggest difference between the two you know the imunosuppressive and the sort of gerrotective effect is really the amount the frequency and the amount.

[01:16:47] Um the reason why people adopted this sort of once weekly dose is to f first not have any imunosuppression and second to mitigate the secondary effect which are thought to be caused by uh inhibition of mtor torque 2 which is the second complex yeah the glucose effect and that seems to be working largely. Um what was uh in my case remarkable is that every time I took my dose not two I did only did two for a couple of weeks but either four or six the next morning

[01:17:18] I would have a pimple on my nose. So I was immunosuppressed clearly uh every single time. For a day. Yeah. For a day. For a day or two. And you know I sort of made peace with it in the fact that if I had a really heavy workout I would have exactly the same thing. Exercise is imunosuppressive. if you if you if you go all out, you know, you can get a cold, you can you know, you're temporarily fragilized after a really heavy exercise. So I think um the the difference really between these these these two these two world of imunosuppression which clearly has been documented by clinical trials it is imunosuppressive by itself uh versus the beneficial effect on the immune system to me is a question of dosage and frequency and yet I cannot reconcile the unambiguous success of the interventions testing program where those mice were eating rapamy in every single bite of food they took. In fact, they were consuming it more continuously than even the most immune compromised patient. And without exception, every single ITP study of rapamy, whether they started in old mice or young mice, RAPA alone, RAPA with another drug, it just doesn't matter. It always worked. How do we reconcile that? I I we do have well I don't have the answer but I can I can sort of uh talk about it in a way I just there's something that worries me about our reliance on the mouse as a model system um uh for aging for studying aging and how relevant it is to us as as species even mice that are of the qual I mean because we would all admit that the ITP mice are the best they're the Ferrari of mice. Exactly. The ITP is the best because uh is the best way to address this question uh because they're using mice that are you know cross so it's not in not inbred when you're using black six you're essentially doing the experiment on N of one and the whole world I mean 80% of the work that's being done in mice is done on on black six this is we're all studying the same person um so obviously when you go and try to transfer this to a human population with all of it variation. So the ITP did the right thing. That being said, and this is not an attack on ITP. I think ITP is a great program and should be funded and we should continue to study this. I just worry about the over reliance on ITP alone. And I think we should have another system that studies um uh primate interventions with drugs. There are a number of primates, non-human primates that are actually much closer to us. The reason I worry about mouse is is something that actually Steve Astart

[01:20:10] U that you've had on on this podcast as well. Steve is a good friend and he came up with something called the longevity quotient which I think is a something that people do not pay attention enough. So longevity quotient is this idea that um if you look across the animal kingdom the larger you are the longer you live.

[01:20:32] Okay? So you can take thousand species and you can weigh you know you on on the x- axis you have their their size on a y-axis their um their life expectancy it largely rises to the right and you can see a monotonous curve now there are exceptions to this um one of them is um naked mole yeah naked mole rats y for example uh naked mole rats you know are living way above. So they live above they punch above their weight. Dogs tend to punch below their weight.

[01:21:07] Exactly. Although in dogs it again varies by within the size thing it seems between species. Then when you look intra species it gets even more complicated which is the larger dog lives shorter than the smaller dogs the great dane versus the Chihuahua. That is done actually that's driven mostly by growth hormone which is again another another reason why we should look at you know taking growth hormone as an anti-aging drug with some degree of circumspection because uh in dogs the more growth hormone you have the larger you are and the shorter you live. We know also in humans the the larger you are the taller you are the shorter you live. So are these effect of growth hormone? Yes. Are they only important while during the growth phase? That that's a possibility, but it's something that really gives me pause to go back to our discussion about growth hormone. Now, where was I? I sort of lost my ch.

[01:22:00] You're still trying to make the argument for why ITP mice given rapamy with every bite of food somehow live longer. So, u again going back to respiratory quot the the longevity quotient, um mice are also an exception. they punch below their their weight. So they live shorter than they should based on so on their you know on their size and humans is the biggest exception. We live about six five to six times longer than we should uh based on our size which tells me that um you know we aren't a naked mole rat of primates. We do incredibly well which means that we already have optimized a lot of these pathways that are you know promoting aging. I suspect the mice is exactly the opposite. I I don't know that someone has really compared sort of intrinsic to to activity in mice. Are they for example living in and you know mice are especially laboratory mice are engineered to reproduce and and grow as quickly as possible. They have large litter size. They do everything very quickly. Now we know all of these activities are requiring a lot of anabolic uh you know strength which is driven by to. So the question is are the mice sort of examples of animals that are maximizing to activity to do everything they do very quickly and we are maybe at the other end of the spectrum where we have low sort of uh basal to activity. So that's where I worry when you know people just transfer everything we know from to mice into humans is saying it's going to show and work in humans. I don't know if you heard such an interesting point.

[01:23:40] Yeah. So I think this is and this is frankly why I stopped taking rapamy. I thought you know um I did not really see anything in terms of anything uh metabolically, physically, muscle strength. I could not you know in contrast to GLP1 agonist where I saw all of my numbers get better um and functionally strength all of this. I saw everything getting better on GLP agonist with rapamy I never could could tell whether I was taking it or not.

[01:24:09] Yeah. Although look and of well it's not just that I would say where rapamy acts I don't know that we would see anything getting significantly better right because if we think that the main places that rapamy is is going to act would be on uh autophagy. Well there's no way you're going to measure autophagy.

[01:24:31] You're not going to feel autophagy. You're not going to see it or measure it. Um, does it tamp down on certain subsets of scinesscent cells? That that's certainly plausible. Again, I don't know how we're going to see or measure or necessarily even feel that. Um, does it reduce some of the tonic lowgrade unhelpful inflammation?

[01:24:52] Probably. But again, if a person doesn't have much to begin with, it's going to be tough to measure. Conversely, GLP-1 agonists act directly on a thing that is so easy to measure, which is glucose metabolism and body weight for those who are losing weight as well. So, so it might not be a fair comparison. I guess the other thing I would add to this interesting observation is that of course the mice in the ITP are still in a relatively sterile environment and it might be that even if they incur some immunosuppression it's not going to be as maladaptive as it would be if they were wild animals as we are live in a sterile environment. They live grouped in a cage with no ability to move to exercise. They are uh they eat a diet which uh makes the American diet look like the most healthy thing ever. I mean, have you ever seen the pellets that these mice are eating?

[01:25:50] Do the ITP mice eat the crappy pellets as well? I suspect they're eating Okay. I don't I don't actually know what their diet is. Yeah, I don't know what their diet is, but I mean there are not that many. I can guarantee you they're not eating salads and and and fruits and and vegetables. So in some way they are an incredibly artificially bad uh you know sort of environment.

[01:26:13] The these mice actually doing everything that is conducive to a poor health and and so the fact that we see something that works in that system might have some value for you know the fraction of the population that has a very poor lifestyle. But I I do worry about you know transferring this to someone uh like you and I who are exercising or trying to eat well or trying to sleep and and and all of this. So I I I I take these observations with some degree of caution and and and frankly I you know I when people ask me should I go on rapamy I do worry um now this is a different you know it's very different story if someone a patient comes and sees sees you at 40 years old and tells you I think I I want to go and rap a mison I would strongly argue that this you should not do this because even in the in the studies that have been conducted they still saw an effect in mice that were the equivalent of 65 to 70 years old. Now if you're 75 years old and you have the feeling you're u you you know you're chronically inflamed and you have the feeling that things are not doing well um there are a number of anecdotal cases where people have described really feeling a lot better and a lot stronger very quickly uh on rapamy on rapamy but I would predict it would be the same thing with a growth hormone or some of these interventions. So, I've really put those in different categories and I my argument to people is um today we have one intervention that is very profoundly anti-aging um and it is physical activity exercise in all of its forms and uh once you have optimized this I think let's talk about doing something else on top of that.

[01:27:52] So earlier you brought up the certuan story in NAD I'd love to spend a little bit of time there. Um, I was at a talk recently and as always I get asked questions about stuff like that and I got asked the the question about NAD and I said look this is one of those things where if I tell you the following facts I'm going to tell you three facts.

[01:28:17] NAD is completely ubiquitous throughout the body and um it is absolutely essential for the most important chemical reactions that happen in the body. You cannot undergo redux reactions, metabolic reactions without NAD. Um that is that is point one. Point two is a class of proteins called certuins rely heavily on NAD as the substrate in the process of repairing DNA. That is fact two. Fact three is as you age NAD levels decline precipitously.

[01:28:59] Okay, those are three facts and I don't believe is there any dispute to any of those facts? No controversy. Okay, armed with those three facts, how could it be that supplementing NAD does not lead to a longer better life or some health benefit? Um, that's a logical conclusion right now. Well, not completely because uh you are assuming you know it it depends also what is the reason why NAD levels decrease.

[01:29:32] Yes. And it depends also what supplements how do you remedy this this is something I'd love to talk about CD38 and and some of the work so so so so it could be that NAD levels go down because their consumption goes up right so there's there's as we age there's more DNA damage there's more consumption the certuins need more of it and it goes up and then of course the question would become is the current level of NAD that we have rate limiting to that reaction if not then all the extra NAD in the world should have no benefit because you're just adding more substrate to a reaction where it's not needed. Uh, conversely, if NAD levels are going down because there's a production issue and if you provided more of it, you could actually do more good, well then it could be the exact opposite story. So, let me pause there for a moment and have you fill in the edges of everything I just said so that we can go deeper into this discussion.

[01:30:25] So maybe explain a little bit what NAD is, explain, you know, what it means in redox and obviously let's talk about certuins and the role that NAD plays there. Lots to unpack there. It could be a twohour uh a two-hour podcast. Um but one it's one area that we've worked on for the last 25 years. So we we were responsible for cloning the human suins actually after

[01:30:47] Lenny Garante published you know his paper on on su and yeast. We were the graduate student. Matt was the first to publish this, wasn't he? Uh Matt. Yeah, actually Matt and Brian. I mean, that the whole and and David, I mean, that whole gang was the original gang along with Lenny Garanti were paved the way for a lot of the what we know.

[01:31:08] Now, eventually, you know, like one thing that I would um just start by saying is that it pains me in some way in a field that is so rich and has generated so much data that there's a whole cloud. sort of lying on top of sertuins and NAD that you know there's nothing there's nothing there I I just tell people it is an incredibly u studied system uh we are still juggling the complexity and I would argue that any any field where um the the same degree of of investigation will be conducted will have the same controversy. This is the nature of science. The beauty of science is that it's incredibly messy on the way on the way up, but eventually things are are getting clarified. And I think in in the terms of the Suins, we're still right in the middle of it. So there's some complete garbage. I completely agree with that.

[01:32:01] And and by the way, I'm not completely dismissive. What I will say has made has made this field complicated is that the leading proponents of it have all opted for a commercial pathway. Agree. And therefore they have opted not to study this in a rigorous way but to study it in a commercial way. And unfortunat I mean I understand why you would do that. Like that's that's the nature of it. And this is not a molecule that you can put um uh you're not going to generate intellectual property in the same way that you would um around a novel drug. And so it poses a limitation to how these things can be studied. But unfortunately that coupled with the uh rveratrol fiasco uh and I I really unless you think otherwise Eric we don't need to talk about rveratrol but I I am

[01:32:50] I remain completely convinced that rveratrol had zero benefit whatsoever. I think it is an absolutely uh useless molecule. Um so I think that rveratrol debacle um the overhype complete debacle of that coupled with the fact that all of the participants in the NAD landscape are doing it through their own commercial enterprise with their own proprietary blend has has resulted in this inability to drive forward in this field.

[01:33:18] I agree. I agree. I think it's I mean you've identified the problems the hype and the commercialization. I mean commercialization can be helpful if the the companies are actually willing to invest in clinical trials and so on. You know, I always use the example of timeline uralithn a I mean there we've worked with them they do clinical trials rigorous there you know we they publish them in in the best journals and at the end you know what you're measuring and and so um that being said for the so let's try to maybe sort of step back and uh given the controversy I would say I would encourage your your listener not to just discard it all we're still in the middle of it and I think there's something interesting will emerge out of it so is a critical intermediary metabolite.

[01:34:04] It it has two big roles. First is it plays a key role in redux reactions. Again we've talked about these reaction reduction oxidation anytime electrons need to move around. Exactly. So it's it exists in two form NAD and ADH. Um and it's critical to intermediary metabolism. Uh there are more than 600 of these enzymes that use

[01:34:27] NAD in the whole metabolism. So it stands to reason that if you losing NAD levels, it's going to be you go below a certain critical level, these enzymes are going to suffer. Your whole metabolism is going to go down. And we know by the way that decreasing metabolic efficiency at all level is is one of the hallmarks of aging. So in addition to these enzymes that utilize the NADAH couple there's a whole series of other enzyme that actually are digesting cleaving NAD and these would be the PARPS bodus polymerase. So these are enzymes mostly involved in DNA repair. So it plays a critical role. U suins seven suins um all doing different things within the cell and we can go back and dig in into this a little bit in terms of what what are the sertuins doing. Um there's also uh another uh and two enzymes called CD38 and CD 157. And so these are also NAD hydraases and we are studying them a lot now. Um so that's I guess the the background uh of what uh these enzymes are doing. One thing that your your listeners should know about um uh about NAD levels and why the decrease in NAD levels are relevant to aging is with respect to the certuins because sertuins have a relatively narrow range of KD for NAD. So if the

[01:35:59] NAD levels change as we know they do during aging, it will lead to a change in the activity of the of the suins. And I think this is something that was proposed by Lenny Garante back in the days and showed for example even during fasting your NAD levels will increase and this will activate suin. So I think there's this is something that's really unique to the suin is there and we know this u in a really acute way because there are suins that are present in the cytoplasm versus in the mitochondria versus in the nucleus and the NAD levels in each of these organs are very different for example much higher in mitochondria. It turns out that 33 has a KD for um for

[01:36:41] NAD which is much higher than 31. And so variation so that really is the indication that they are sensors of NAD levels which goes back to the initial model that you mentioned NAD levels change during aging. Therefore we can expect the activity of the sertuins to change. Now um what else have I not addressed in in your initial batch of questions? I think we're now ready to then move on to if we believe with some conviction that restoring NAD levels in an aging individual is beneficial.

[01:37:25] We now have to deal with the same problem you deal with any small molecule or large molecule for that matter. How do you get it in the body? So how what are the ways in which you could get NAD into the body directly or indirectly? So that brings me to maybe another element of the biochemistry obviously. So one thing that has emerged is this idea that um the question is to why do NAD level decrease and there's been lots of theories uh activation of the PARPS that seems to be uh happening in C elegance but it in mammals uh this is the work of

[01:38:06] Eduardo Chini who was the first one to show that CD38 uh appears to be the major driver of the decrease of NAD during aging. And the way he's demonstrated this, and we've actually repeated some of his results and and and published on this as well, if you study a mouse that's knocked out for CD38, you find that ND levels actually do not decrease during aging.

[01:38:30] And that's pretty much across all organs. And I think that what this does is really brings uh the whole question is in terms of what should we be targeting. Now, think about did we talk about what CD38 is doing specifically? Yeah. So CD38 is a um as a membrane anchored protein. Some of it is facing um outward on the outside of the cell.

[01:38:53] Some of it is facing inward. Um for example in T- cells it's mostly facing inward. Um no outward in macrofase it's mostly facing inward. And it is in a dehydrase. Now what is it doing in the immune system? Why do we have it? Not entirely clear. One idea is that because it it is present in T- cell is it on non-immune cells uh endothelial cells okay as well um one idea at least for the immune system is that it might come up and and eat up all the NAD that's local in the extracellular fluid although there's not much of it and limit the ability as part of the innate immune response and part limit the ability of b of bacteria and other organism to actually access these micronutrient for their own growth. That's one thinking, but I think it's a lot more complicated than this. And we're really in the middle of it. I have a good part of my lab actually studying the role of CD38 in the immune system and in endothelial cells and in the brain as well.

[01:39:54] Now, you mentioned a moment ago that the CD38 knockouts do not see a decline in NAD with aging. Zero. And they live longer. I was just about to say, what is the phenotype of a CD38 knockout? What deficiency do they have? Uh, nothing that we can tell. And they live longer. How much longer? Uh 15%. That's comparable to rapamy.

[01:40:14] Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty significant. This has been published by Edward Chini. Why do you think that is? Do in other words, do you think that that is true true and unrelated to the increased pool of NAD? Now CD38. So that's that's a key question and that's one that's not been answered. Um, and I would say if I had to go on a limb, I would say it's not linked to the

[01:40:38] NAD decrease. Um, because it turns out that, sorry, just to make sure everybody understands what you're saying. You're saying your belief is that the CD38 mouse does the knockout does not live longer because he has more NAD. That's just another bit issue we're seeing and that there's something else about that mouse.

[01:40:57] Yes. Or it might be partially partially the NAD and partially the other mechanism. I'm about to discuss one thing that's remarkable is that uh as we age us and mice we see an increase in CD38 level um across the organism especially in the immune system we've published a paper showing that the SASP from scinsesscent cells is a very powerful inducer of CD38 expression in macrofasages so that's one mechanism by which uh we're linking you know scinsessence and the SAS to increase

[01:41:29] CD38 leading to a depletion of NAD and other effect and yet we have no idea what it's doing other than hydraying NAD. It has a cognate receptor on other cells. It's part of the you know it's they don't seem to be immune deficient. Uh they don't it's really one of these players that people there are hundreds of papers.

[01:41:49] I mean do do you think it plays a role in inflammation a negative role in inflammation? One idea about it is that it plays a suppressive role in the immune response. So because we see it being induced kind of ladish in the immune response and the idea it comes on to tamper down. So it's actually the exact opposite.

[01:42:07] It's it's it's so pro- anti-inflammatory that it can be harmful in that way as opposed to contributing to sterile inflammation which is the more typical problem we see in aging. Yeah, we we we did not discuss this but you know the corer the other side of the immune system is that it has to be incredibly balanced between reacting appropriately towards um exogenous pathogen but not reacting against the self. And as you know as a physician there are so many conditions that are a manifestation of an excess of immune response against the the individual all of the autoimmune response autoimmune diseases which by the way increase during aging. So the thinking is that um except for type 1 diabetes.

[01:42:55] Yes, that's the one young. Why do you I know that you used to study that. Why why do you think that is? It's really an interesting question. Although you know there's uh something called lad that I'm sure you you've heard about that is emerging that we might have been diagnosing some type two that were actually late type one. Yeah.

[01:43:13] Um the thing that is really unique about uh type one is the fact that um there I remember a number of papers that highlight the fact that there might be something happening during development that exposes um the uh immune system to the developing beta cells and that might trigger more autoimmunity at that time.

[01:43:37] It could also be linked to the fact that there's been for many years a discussion of the role of viruses infection and mim molecular mimicry between some of these viruses and and beta cells. So it could be that a subset of infections that happen during childhood actually puts you at at risk of activating your immune system inappropriately. So that that's the whole the whole idea. But there's clearly an increase autoimmunity throughout life.

[01:44:03] By the way, CD57, do we see the same effects? Do we have a CD57 knockout? No. Uh much less studied. There is some interesting effect also. But you know CD38 has garnered CD3 most of the attention. So you know if you think about I'll go back about CD38 and in terms of um what it's doing it's taking NAD and cleaving it into ADP ribos which is you know the sugar and nucleotide and and um and nicotinomide. Nicotinomide is a precursor to NAD and so this nicotenomide which is generated by CD38 but by the sertuins by the PARPS normally gets recycled um in a two-step reaction all the way back to NAD. Now what's really interesting is if you block this it's called the salvage pathway for nicotinomide. If you block it within a few hours your NAD levels go down to zero. So the system

[01:45:01] Wow. heavily dependent on recycling. incredible actually and there's a specific inhibitor of this enzyme called NMPT you can add it to cells we've done the experiment within four to six hours NAD levels down to zero the cell dies so there's an incredible churning through that whole pathway now which is a reflection of the activity of suins uh

[01:45:23] CD38 CD 157 the PARPs and so on um so you have a situation during aging where CD38 increases is you increase the degradation and so you decrease the pool of NAD but you're increasing in theory the metabolites you're increasing the metabolites nicotenomite now one important thing is nicotenomite um metabolism is either salvage back to NAD or methylation by an enzyme and this is important for supplementation because it turns out

[01:45:56] CD38 not only cleaves NAD but it also cleaves NMN which is one of the one of the two one of the two precursors NN and NR. So when you actually are have increased CD38 activity and you take NMN you churn through this pathway and actually you increase your nicotenomide and you increase its methylation.

[01:46:16] So NMN is also cleaved by CD38. Yes. Into what? Into uh nicotenomide plus something is not ADP ribos. Yes. Okay. And so when you do this you're increasing your level of nicotenomide to the point that uh it's shunting to methyl nicotenomide starts depleting your your one carbon cycle. So what you see in a number of people actually on an

[01:46:39] MN is their homocyine level going up including me um I I stopped taking it when I saw this. I thought this is not I was taking about a gram of NMN for a while and then I saw my homoyine level going up. I think as a reflection of this this pathway and basically stopped it. Now why is it Eric that the increased pool of nicotinomide preferentially goes down a methylation pathway as opposed to the salvage pathway to give you more

[01:47:07] NAD? I I don't think it goes pref preferentially. It just depends how much you It's just the more you put in even if it splits stokometrically or stochastically even it's it's you're just going to sell you're going to take away one carbon. Yeah. And I do not know what the the relative proportion is. But clearly the more you drive the system uh with NMN uh the more you're going to yield uh these and we can measure not only how much did your homoyine go up by the way up to 15 from from typical seven.

[01:47:40] Wow that's a big jump. And then how long did it take to resolve once you stopped the NMN? Well I only I measured typically every three months. So after after 3 to 6 months it had gone back to normal to 7 to eight. What about NR nicotenomide ribocide? How is that treated by CD38? Uh it's not it's not metabolized by itself. NR eventually in the cell has to make it back to NMN which is one is is on the on the salvage pathway that we talked about. Uh so NR is you know is is is less bulky less big than NMN. So it is able to get into the cell but eventually it makes it into nicotine NMN and then goes back into the same pathway. So eventually they all come back to the same.

[01:48:27] So do you think that there's no difference between the same amount of NR and NN? No, there clearly are some differences um especially in all the really complex biochemistry that happens in terms of getting them into cells. You know there are the problem with NR and NMN is that you are if you think about what the approach is you're essentially you have a pool of NAD which is a sink think about a sink full of water and you keep you know it's leaking that's your CD38 that's that's the leak at the bottom of the sink and you keep pouring more NMN more NR inside of it you're just going to you're just going to accelerate you know the leak or you're going to make it you're not going to solve the problem basically maybe you'll reestablish the val the level at a normal semi-normal but the churning through is is problematic now why is the churning through problematic because some of the byproducts of CD38 for example are um u cyclic ADP ribos uh so there's two forms of ADP ribos not cyclized and cycized cyclized activates um calcium signaling and so there's a whole aspect of the biology of CD38 that's linked to calcium signaling. So I think I do worry about the supplementation with the NR and NMN.

[01:49:52] Um I do worry about it. I'm not discounting them. I think clinical trials are ongoing. There's dozens of clinical trials. So we will soon identify something that in which it has a benefit. Again, if you think about the the metabolism of these metabolites, um it's incredibly complicated. There are effects on the microbiome. There are effects on, you know, different absorption by different cells. Just literature, hundreds and hundreds of papers, I think way beyond what your audience probably wants to hear. But um uh and I would say, you know, at this point, most of what you can buy as supplement have doses that are so low.

[01:50:34] This is where there's an important discordance also when we do experiment. We've seen amazing things in in laboratory animals in terms of supplementing with an RNN. This is where the excitement comes from. But typically these animals are getting 10 times more than what you're buying as a supplement. And the reason is I think you know grass uh sort of status is given to these companies to give a small amount.

[01:51:01] Yeah. Grass meaning generally regarded as safe. FDA's criteria for giving something that is naturally occurring that doesn't requine

[01:51:16] went from 7 to 15 um I guess two questions would be has that been reported elsewhere is there do we is that a known phenomenon in the trials that are testing NMN are they measuring homoyine to see if that's I must have read it somewhere because I was I was you were looking for it I was looking for it And then the second question is how would you then tolerate 10 grams of NMN? I mean if one gram is doing that what I mean now you're you would deplete all one carbon. What does that does that mean you wouldn't even be able to alter your epiggenome in ways that might be favorable? it it it you run all all kinds of risk and you know a number of people that I I've seen the same thing and start taking trimethly or you know you know so to try to supplement this I I I do worry about this I think for me um and again I want to reiterate the fact that I think the data and animal models of what some of the things that we've seen with some of these precursors is really interesting and and really you know this is why there's so much interest did you ever try using TMG to see if it would offset the

[01:52:20] No, I didn't. That would be an interesting little self experiment. Um, okay. What about intravenous NAD? So, that that is sort of one of my pet peeves. Um, and again, you know, I try in everything to be to remain open-minded to things that I don't know and don't understand. My prediction is that first NAD is not a an extracellular molecule. NAD does not exist or almost does not exist at all in the plasma. It is an intracellular and as I mentioned you know high concentration in the mitochondria somewhat much lower in the cytoplasm in the nucleus. So the whole idea of injecting intravenous NAD is first it's too big to be absorbed by cells. So what is the body doing with it? There is a famous paper by uh Josh Benovitz

[01:53:14] Robinovitz that showed that if you inject it actually introvenously you actually get it mostly calibed by the liver into nicotinomide. Now nicotenomide is one of the fraction of nascin. You can buy this at the pharmacy for very cheap. You can go into a an IV clinic and get a $700 injection of NAD. um very few studies, one or two I I've read both of them, they're interesting.

[01:53:44] Um so my opinion is that NAD introvenously is not something that should be done. Um the same thing for in you know subcutaneously. I've seen another company that sells it um subcutaneously. Really no evidence for doing this. Now that being said, I've heard and this is where I try to remain open-minded because there obviously we don't know everything. Um I have heard sort of anecdotal evidence of dramatic effect in some patients with

[01:54:16] Parkinson's. people really describing sort of a not a miraculous but a near miraculous effect right after the infusion having increase in motor performance that you can really assess in someone who's has severe Parkinson so um again not studied systematically there's a lot is there mechanistically is there a reason you could explain that yes through dopamine or something else there's a whole literature on uh on the effect of uh NAD precursors and so on on

[01:54:50] Parkinson's mostly animal models and I think there are lots of clinical trials going on in Parkinson's as well. So but more using the standard NR and NMN. Uh the thing that I've described is more couple of friends who've told me I've seen this um um not enough to you know to to make a product but enough maybe to question maybe this is there's something more to it than than than what we truly know. But you know the proliferation of these introvenous clinic frankly how complicated is it to produce a bag of intravenous NAD

[01:55:23] I don't think it's very expens very very complicated I mean I I've never made I know um making NMN uh at purity is is really it's not you know took some effort to scale it up and so some of the companies that have been doing this right now there's like one major supplier out of China that pretty much everybody uses um but in terms of NAD I

[01:55:45] I think this is this is an industrial process and and I I can tell you it's not $700. Yeah, I'm sure it's not. So, do you think I if if a person was going to supplement with one orally, do you think there's a case for NR being superior to NMN? I would say no. Uh I would say take them both. Uh if you're going to do something and you want to a bit of an insurance, you know, let's say and and I I did this for a while. I I'm not doing it right now. Uh you know take 250 milligrams of each and and and you'll have a half a gram. You are in a safe relatively safe dose. Follow your homoyine.

[01:56:26] Um if you are, you know 60 or above, you you could make the case this could be part of of a stack. Although this is the same thing that we see with so many of these supplements right now. You know how which one do you take? Which ones are beneficial? There's one a little bit of a dark cloud linked to um uh NAD supplementation is the demonstration that the SASP is actually uh dependent uh on um on NAD levels. And so when you are actually uh increasing NAD levels, you might be increasing these pro-inflammatory markers. So because let me make sure I understand why because the SASPs which for folks listening these are the soluble products made by the scinsesscent cells that effectively are doing all the bad things that we don't want to see scesscent cells doing.

[01:57:17] So now they are dependent on CD38 to some extent. So as CD38 goes up they go up and are you saying as you give more NR and more NMN you might churn it up. You might be turnurning up the SASPs. Yeah. The other thing also is there's been some by the way all of this speak let me let me finish you you finish your point and then I want to make a broader point.

[01:57:40] No there's there's also some uh worry about the fact that uh supplementing with some of these uh these precursors might also accelerate tumor growth. So this would not have an effect in in in you and I who don't have a cancer but if it's someone out there who has a an early form of a cancer this could lead to an acceleration. This is something that's been shown in animal models that it giving some you know some powers to some people in terms of recommending this to be uh taken over by everyone.

[01:58:11] Now the the folks who make this have strenuously denied that there is any um any validity to those animal models that have suggested that or the um and some of this has been done in in in um in vitro as well. Correct. Um, so how I'm not I'm not very familiar with that literature. I saw I remember seeing one study. It was very small. Uh, you know, my take on it was I guess if you had cancer, this might be a bad idea to take. Uh, but but but I didn't find it that convincing. So, so

[01:58:47] I I agree with you and it's it's it is a general consideration for our whole field of longevity research is uh you know better is the enemy of good is something that was uh sort of drilled into me as I went through medical school you know u we have a term in French which is um sort of like therapeutic uh overdoing it you know just uh doing too much there's such a thing as overdoing it for your patient

[01:59:16] And in this case, the whole longevity field, you know, is embracing a whole series of these um interventions. I mean, there's not a a week that doesn't go by that I don't see a new supplement being touted online and so on. And I read about all of them. The question is um which ones should you be taking? Uh which ones are actually risky, which ones are not? And and to me, this is part of the whole balance of the equilibrium I'm trying to reach. If there's something that really has a beneficial effect, you want to be on it as soon as possible. If not, um, you know, why take the chance?

[01:59:51] Yeah, I think that's I mean, you've said it, that's the point I was going to make at the outset, but but you you've said it so much better. Um, let's pivot a little bit to a couple other things I want to chat about quickly. Let's talk about interlucan 11. So big trial last fall that looked at blocking interlucan 11 which is a molecule that's made by immune cells plays an important role in inflammation. Um and this was done in mice and those mice lived longer. What do you make of the study?

[02:00:20] Read the paper like you. I don't have sort of an inside knowledge about inter of course when the paper came out it was like interlucan 11. I mean we as an iminologist you talk about one interlucan one two four seven six seven you know but 11 never heard about it. So I went to and there's actually you know it goes up to like 30. So I I went and read the paper. It's it's an inflammatory marker. So again it could be a on par with one in six.

[02:00:48] No, I would say probably not. Um so it came out a little bit in the left out out of the left field. Um but it sort of makes sense in the context of what we know about the inflammatory response linked to aging. So and maybe this is where I can I can add one point is when we think about the chronic inflammation of aging sort of inflammaging um it is both cause and effect.

[02:01:16] We talked about how the immune response um helps you to protect yourself against um uh the innate immune response against pathogen as a first line of defense. The innate immune response also has another important role is that it recognizes damage any kind of damage. If you cut yourself, if you have a a wound of of you know inside of your organ, coronary artery, a coronary artery, a coronary artery, the this will act any kind of damage, unfolded proteins, there's all kinds of things. So the innate immune response will be triggered and will activate itself. So as we age and as damage slowly accumulates because aging isn't is a slow irreversible accumulation of damage um eventually your immune system responds to this by becoming chronically activated. And so the problem is that you might think well this is great because you actually repairing all of this damage. The problem is the activation of the immune response by itself becomes problematic because these cells macrofasages for example a powerful tissue remodeler and so the immune system in this case is sort of Dr. ejaculate mystic hide it's helping but it's it's facing an uncsurmountable amount of damage and eventually its activation leads to NAD depletion that's one of the things that it does but many other things stem cell dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction so the whole idea here is that um

[02:02:48] IL1 might simply be I mean is one of the key markers of this chronically activated immune system so this is not something I imagine you're going to give to a 20 year old but in someone who's getting really in the part where chronic immune age immune activation is present um could really play an important role in the future and what the paper showed was again in mice but from what I understand is already an existing molecule uh yes and they're actually recently was contacted by a company that has another uh novel inhibitors of of IL11 you could imagine this to become part of the whole armamentarium that we have against aging.

[02:03:29] And then how do you see playing that off something on the other side of the spectrum? Because because we're really trying to deal with two sides of this system. We want to tamp down the part that's overactive and we want to ramp up the part that's underactive. So we've got basically the only example we have over here is rapamy. This one does this.

[02:03:48] And then we now have IL11 inhibition or I mean they use knockout mice but block this. That did good things. So is this one of those things where you need to do both to get and by the way maybe you have growth hormone over here as well one there also anti-1 as well which yeah block IL1 block IL11 give growth hormone give rapamy I mean but here's the problem you get into this reductionist state which is like the whole NAD world of NR and NMN hey it sounds great but what if there's unintended consequences we can't see like even as much as I love thinking about this and want to do all of these things, I start to think, man, what is the probability we're going to get this right?

[02:04:31] Agree. And the immune system is uh an incredibly tenuous system, which is in really delicate balance. So the balance is too much immunity. You might say, well, this is good protection against cancer, protection against uh microbes, right? But then you get autoimmunity. But then you get autoimmunity. Not enough immunity. Well, you you run the risk of being, you know, killed by a pneumonia or some kind of infection, but at least you don't have too much inflammation.

[02:05:01] Yes. Yeah. So, there's a very fine balance. And well, this this gets to this is why I wish we had a dashboard. We What are the biomarkers we can use for these things because we don't have this problem with blood pressure? We don't have this problem with thyroid hormone. We don't have this problem with so many things that we treat because we can measure what we care about.

[02:05:22] That's a a good point. Then the question is you know what is first I mean the immune system is so complex there's not going to be one single marker uh you know my colleague David Ferman is this this thing called I age which is a immune aging set of uh test that you can actually uh conduct um that was the first attempt at trying to measure immune aging you know they have a whole bunch of what do they actually measure is it all serum biomarkers yes serum biomarkers and mostly cytoines

[02:05:50] CXC validated how uh been validated in clinical studies. So they they've I am immunoaging. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I age. Oh, I age. Okay. Yes. I I don't know. I don't know if it's uh So, this was developed and pioneered by uh David Ferman and Mark Davis. Uh so, David Ferman is with us at the Bach. Mark Davis is still at Stanford. Um

[02:06:14] I guess this brings us to um to clocks. Yes. I don't even know if I have the energy to talk about this. Um, okay. Where do you want to begin? There's so many of these things out there. Yes. Some of them are commercially available. Some of them are just tools of research at the moment. Some of them aim to tell you an actual age, an actual number that represents your biological age as opposed to your chronological age. Some of them don't aim to tell you that at all. They just want to tell you a rate of aging. uh some of them look only at the epigenetic signature. In other words, they look directly at the methylation uh sequence, others look at a host of markers, including some very simple serum biomarkers like glucose levels and vitamin D levels and things like that.

[02:07:08] So, how do you make sense of all of those tools? Right now, we don't. Um I think so. First first statement is they are not ready for prime time in terms of patient management. There are research tools. Uh and I think I which is interesting because they're far outside of research labs at this point. Yes, they are available commercially. U

[02:07:35] I've done the same thing. I don't remember who told you told me someone actually was it Matt Matt uh measured his clocks. I do the same thing actually. I measure them every 3 months and uh I use it's just a scatter plot. It's a scatter plot in a way you know I'm between 25 and 68. uh which is of course I like the clock that you know show me to be young but uh so that being said um so we know that you know we're learning so we know that for example you you alluded to the fact that they they can vary the same clock there's circa circadian variation for example five years so your age can vary by five years using some of the clocks depending on when you measure uh when you you what time of day yeah what time of day which is you know that's biology ology that just tells you you know the epiggenome is something that's highly dynamic and so that's something as we learn obviously you know the companies will will encourage you to measure it you know to draw the blood always at the same time um now the whole field right now is pretty much focused almost completely focused on um

[02:08:43] DNA methylation I you know and Steve Horvat has done beautiful work I mean it's really pioneering work identifying and all this and uh Morgan Lavine and others have have gone on you know Dan Bellski I think with Denedin Pace uh which is another epigenetic clock that measures the pace of aging. By the way I think this is probably my favorite because it it really uh seems to be um responding to interventions. You know if you go if you change your diet or if you do something you will see your your pace of aging uh changing. So, I think that one to me seems uh more promising. Um, but it's a whole small, you know, we don't know really how to use these tools clinically. That's the problem. They're they're nice gadgets to to buy, you know, and the companies are selling you supplements and then they're selling you the uh the tests with it. I don't know what to make of it. U personally, I think this is not ready for prime time.

[02:09:44] It's something that should be done uh in the future. uh it might become in the future. Would you agree with my stern words on this? Because I've I've made a lot of enemies by saying that if as a consumer you encounter a company that is selling you a test, especially a test that is not validated in any clinic clinically meaningful way and then in the same breath selling you a supplement to fix the result of that test. You need to run.

[02:10:18] I agree. I mean I I just I I don't have the patience for that kind of behavior. Someone told me actually um recently that u one of these tests actually that you can measure almost everyone who who gets their result is low and of course low being good or bad in this test or whatever. No, it's bad. Bad. Yeah, it's insufficient. And the next step is the recommendation. You have to buy this supplement to solve the problem. So yes,

[02:10:47] I I think you know um again it's the same thing with the Sertuins and the NAD. Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There is a whole series of these players. Uh I'm not disputing their honesty or or their good intention. Uh from what I've seen, I think it's too early. And what do you think is the biggest problem? Is the biggest problem the biologic noise in the system? Which means even if you had the absolute perfect tool to measure and you knew exactly what to measure, the movement of that thing is so great that the probability that you're capturing a meaningful value is irrelevant. In other words, imagine that there's a variable that moves like this.

[02:11:31] But on the small level, it's moving like this. And I'll give you an example. Imagine you were measuring heart rate, but you could only sample it milliseconds at a time, and what you were actually measuring was heart rate variability instead of heart rate. It would be useless. It's too noisy. Agree. I agree.

[02:11:50] Do you think that's the problem? No, I don't think that's a problem. And I I I'll speak personal experience. I you know, I I work with True Diagnostic. They when you get you know they use the epic array and you get not one clock you get dozens. So I get all of them and they tend to be reproducible you know every three months unless I make some interventions but in general there is some cons consistency and I'm not the only one who has seen this. So my advice if you really are determined to use them use all of them. They all are sort of a different mirrors of of your reality.

[02:12:29] You know these the problem of the methylation clocks is that there's a very tenuous link between the change of methylation at any given site and the biology. So when you know typically the clock will measure about 500 uh will rely each clock will rely on about 500 different methylation sites but they're not attached to a specific gene. So you don't really know what it means. But how are they even doing that? They're not measuring with point arrays. How how are they?

[02:12:57] No, they do this with arrays. Yeah, they have about 20 20 million methylation sites that they're assessed, but each clock uses a subset 4 500. Now, the biggest problem with the clocks from my perspective, sorry, just to be clear, you're saying they're actually measuring point of methylation. Yes. Okay.

[02:13:16] Yes. Yes. Um, they're quantifying the level of methylation at each of these sites. Um the problem with the clocks is also where do you obtain them from? Uh typically blood as I mentioned. Yes. It's a it's a heterogeneous compartment. As you age for example you know that your fraction of naive tea cells decreases y down to close to zero. If you're 80 years old your memory tea cells increase. So we did a very simple experiment. We sorted all of these different T- cell subsets. memory, naive, uh, central memory, TM rather, determinally differentiated, and measured their epigenetic age using several of the clocks. 20 to 25 year difference between native the naive or naive sorry and the and the central memory T in the right direction the direction you would the naive are much longer.

[02:14:11] Yeah. So which is I you know that's somewhat interesting that was really interesting for me because it means also any conditions where you see a shift in the relative proportion of these cells for example you get an acute COVID infection what happens you have a massive expansion of your uh your your memory tea cells so it looks like you're going to and then you sample and given that these cells look much older than the other ones you're going to look like you're aging and so

[02:14:41] Um so and there's a whole literature that talks about accelerated aging in rheumatoid arthritis in COVID in HIV all of these conditions that are all associated with chronic immune activation. So what we so that's another confounding variable. So what we did to do this with a a student in the lab, we we made a new clock in which we eliminated all of these um methylation sites that are linked to differentiation. Okay. So now this clock that we've done does not vary actually as a function of the types of cells that are in the blood. Okay. So as as a as a

[02:15:24] T- cell goes from being a naive T- cell to being a memory T- cell to being a TRA the methylation patterns changed as part of the epigenetic regulation. So we eliminated all of those sites and made a new clock called intrin clock which actually is impervious to um your level of immune activation. And what's interesting is that that clock doesn't change anymore during COVID. It doesn't change very little during HIV. It doesn't change during a whole series of conditions where people have talked about aging acceleration including um the story that we talked about earlier on growth hormone.

[02:16:01] What does change it then? What does change it? Uh cancer scinsessence which is really interesting. What about short-term interventions that might be beneficial? So, if you took an individual who uh is insulin resistant and you put them on a GLP1 agonist and 3 months later they're 20 pounds lighter and their insulin resistance has has resolved, how does that change on the clock? Well, I would not be able to tell you specifically for individual clocks, but uh Dan Bellski's Dened in Pace clock is the one that repeatedly people have shown seems to be responding to interventions which is you know the two the two qualities that you want in a clock is one to be predictive and the other one to be predictive of ultimate income sort of you know life expectancy or the occurrence of disease but also So you want it to be um modulatable, responsive and many of them actually but the and and reproducible and reproducible. Yes.

[02:17:06] Reproducible I think is more a question of the laboratory that's doing it. So there are but also potentially the biologic noise still. Exactly. So so biologic noise and laboratory conditions speak to reproducibility. I agree with what you said. I mean, I I've I've often made this case when people ask me about clocks is um my gripe with with the age clock. So, again, the pace clock is different because it's just trying to give you a rate of aging. And

[02:17:30] I agree with you. I think there might be more there. But but these clocks that spit out, "Hey, Eric, congratulations. You're 25." I say to someone who says, "Isn't that wonderful?" I say, "Maybe." But do you actually believe that a 60 you're 68 you're 68 and your clock said you're 25. Should I expect you to live another 55 years?

[02:17:55] Yes. In other words, is it predictive? Is it a better predictor of future life than chronologic age? And the answer is to my knowledge no. There is no clock that has a better ability to predict lifespan uh than chronologic age does. And until that's the case, I worry that the biologic clocks are creating a bit of a distraction, at least this this subset of clocks, and that we we maybe ought to focus better on clocks where the readout state is more about is this intervention good or bad. Yeah. or is this a net positive intervention or a net negative intervention?

[02:18:37] I agree and I as as we mentioned earlier the the field initially focused on the epigenetic clocks because this is Steve's Horvat's pioneering work. So it got everybody to start thinking we can generate these tools but the field is now moving into um proteomics clock. Is that what Dan So what makes up Dan's clock?

[02:18:58] Dan is methylation. It's also methylation. Why do you think it's doing a better job than maybe Horvath's clock at the moment? I think typically it really depends on how you know how the tool what the variable what the cohort you know how what the question was. I think um I I I don't know. I mean I think that

[02:19:22] Dance is the only one that's doing it in in this way. Why is it working better? They're just looking at in a completely different way. How how much is AI facilitating this at this point? I mean, machine learning is is a key instrument. Essentially, what these clocks are is a regression analysis onto, you know, you start with a variable, which is your age, and you regress each methylation site onto onto the age. You do this on enough people of different ages, you find an average, you know, and eventually what the clocks

[02:19:52] I wonder if that's the wrong way to do it. Wouldn't it be better to bioank these to to get biobanked data and instead of mapping it onto age app it map it onto number of years remaining in life because if you'll know that in a bio bank they've done this they've done this they've done this in terms of uh life expectancy they've done this in terms of morbidity so this is like the third and fourth generation of these clocks now are looking at regression not only on on chronological the the initial one was just chronologically Yeah. And and

[02:20:25] Steve used to go around saying my correlation coefficient is 99. And I was like, well, that's because that's what you built it on. Yeah. Exactly. I I could look at a calendar, you know, I don't need I don't need an epigenetic clock to tell me how how old I am. But the next generation clocks actually had a bigger spread when you look at you. Of course, you have an average.

[02:20:44] That's right. Because they started to build it on a different variable. Exactly. So um what really excites me right now is the whole idea that the field is is moving on to the next stage which is non-epigenetic clocks uh because I'm still frustrated as a biologist trying to understand what what are what are these clocks it should be everything I mean why would we do I mean it doesn't make any sense to me that we wouldn't look at the metabolome the proteome and the epiggenome I mean we should look at every I mean there's there's no excuse today with the compute power not to do that right we have clocks based on fundus

[02:21:17] We have clocks based on skin. We have clocks based on facial recognition. So the clocks are going to be uh measured you know using dozens of different uh biological variables. Uh any biome small company in the Bay Area is using it the tongue a tongue picture the old doctor looking at your tongue. So you can actually use machine learning to recognize patterns of know discoloration and and and and um another you know exciting really story was I I don't know if you're familiar with a Tony Whisker's paper uh using proteomics he has shown for example proteome in plasma changes throughout life y pretty dramatic matter which is really completely mindboggling for me to see that you can be so different as you age uh in terms of your whole blood prote why I mean wouldn't you if if the epiggenome is changing then gene expression is changing if gene expression is changing no yeah yeah yeah it's okay but we and we haven't you know so they've used this to that it would change to such a degree Tony has a beautiful slide which shows you know all of the proteium in the blood and how the colors changed across and do you think that most of those changes are post-transational no Most of them are probably expression level.

[02:22:39] It's expression. Yeah, it's expression. Okay. Um so people are building transcrytoics clock and so um Tony now has a study that is I believe in press or coming out soon um where they've gone back using this proteomics clock and they've done this um uh on a UK bioank more than 40,000 different people and this is the study I we started this discussion on identifying which organs are uh so what what Tony did was actually remarkable

[02:23:11] He looked at each of these proteins that are in the blood and selected some that were predictive to be coming from unique organs. Imagine the what you know about how you measure a tropommyioin for for heart attack. So they did this they went and looked in every single organ and say okay what proteins are specific of this organ and which ones actually can be measured into the plasma and using this they were able to generate what they call an organ specific clock. So what they simp simply from a blood draw they're able to um to really determine um do you have a frailty point in your when I look at you is there like suffering happening in and this is Tony's work through the podium. Tony was corre it's it's a new startup called Vero uh which is u I I mean full disclosure I've joined the board of this company but I I I only joined the board because I was really excited about what they're trying to do and I think it really brings a whole new dimension to these predictive biomarker which is more aligned to what you and I have seen as physicians you know it's sort of simple mind it if it's a protein is released into the blood it shouldn't be there uh it might be indicating uh some suffering and I I've discussed with some colleagues who have used these clocks and have identified some abnormal aging in in a unique organ only to go back and find that there was indeed one problem without going into you know what the issues were but you can yeah I mean the challenge the thing that the reason I tend to be a slow um adopter of these things is even if that's the case the question is how much noises in the system. So I go and do that test on a patient and it comes back and says, "Oh my god, there's something wrong with your liver. Your kidney is a bit too old. You're this. You're that.

[02:25:05] You're this. You're that." So I have two fundamental questions. The first is could I have figured that out another way? So if it's telling me your liver is angry or something's wrong with your liver, how do your transaminases look? Right? If it's telling me something's wrong with your kidney, could I have picked that up on a urinary analysis looking at, you know, 20, you know, creatinin clearance or, you know, cyaten

[02:25:26] C or something else? In other words, is it giving me information that I can get elsewhere in a more reproducible, more validated fashion? The second thing is, let's say it tells me seven things are not perfect and I ultimately, and by the way, everything looks perfect. So, I have my standard essays, everything looks awesome. This test says, "Oh my god, these six or seven things are problematic." And I go poking around, poking around, poking around, and I find out one of them is indeed not working, but the other six were perfectly fine.

[02:25:57] So now we have this huge false positive situation. It's Yeah, exactly. It's the same problem we have with cancer screening, which is, you know, buyer needs to beware of the Pandora's box you open. And at least with MRI, you're dealing with imaging. But this sounds like exciting and yet it's a bit of a black box.

[02:26:16] Agree. Where it's gonna spit out, oh my god, there's something wrong with your left testicle and oh my, what do I need to do? You know, and that that being said, I think, you know, the essays are generated in a way that there are multiple. It's not like one single protein like a tripomyosin. We know that that's a clear indicator.

[02:26:34] There's something cell death in terms of your heart. In this case, the clocks are generated in a way that there are multiple sentinels for each organ. You know, many uh the story I was talking about. So early days, okay, we totally agree with this. It's a startup. I think they will um you know they will deploy it and obviously it's going to take again a group of physicians who are able to look at these tests and this is this is what researches this is what startup you know I can't blame them for trying because I think it has a potential for example to highlight a frailty point which is in in aging research to me is really critical you could have the best mind and the best heart in the world um if something else is going to fail that you are completely unaware of you want to know as soon as as you can. And so they they they you know my prediction is um I'll share the paper with you uh if you're interested in looking. It it's quite exciting in terms of where where this is leading but I agree with you early days.

[02:27:35] Yeah, I will probably maintain a shockingly high degree of skepticism um and and probably enjoy some experimentation with it. But again, my my experience in the real world is that that's just not how it works, right? There aren't people walking around that are insanely remarkably healthy where everything looks amazing, but they have some time bomb they don't know about with the exception of a few things that

[02:28:02] I I'm not sure it would pick up. For example, cancer is always that thing. And of course, there's an entire field of, you know, medicine that's going around with liquid biopsies that's exactly trying to solve that problem. It could be you could reword the liquid biopsy industry through the lens you said which is it's looking for that weakest link which in this case is the earliest signs of cancer and and it could be that a cancer will manifest itself also in local organ suffering and and again leeching it might actually point along with a liquid biopsy that tells you you have some cancer cell it might tell you it might point you to one place where actually this is actually happening yeah again uh it's it's interesting you know the the the case that I've made about MRI is the same because I I have a whole bunch of physician friends who tell me I get a I get a yearly MRI and they tell me why do you do this? I say well because I would rather know and he said well you're going to find all kinds of things. I said we did find something.

[02:28:58] I had a tumor in in behind my jaw and it turns out some mass. It it was not a tumor but it took me six months of worrying about what it was and and decided not to biopsy anything. My sense of all of this is that these are novel ways to practice medicine that Yeah. Yeah. And and and and and I'm I'm I'm criticized heavily for being too much on the forefront of doing that. Um but probably not nearly as far as some.

[02:29:26] Right. I still at the end of the day I think about every time you do a test one, you never do a test unless you're willing to act on an outcome or you have a sense of how an outcome will change your your behavior. like it. We don't order tests for the sake of information. We order tests to make decisions. Um and therefore you must at a minimum understand the full suite of outcomes that can come from the test and how many of them will pose huge trouble for you.

[02:29:57] I I I think honestly a a 20% of my patients opt not to do whole body MRI. Yes. Um, and I fully endorse that decision and I try to talk p patients out of it. I really try to highlight how many times we find thyroid nodules that we have to put needles into that ultimately end up being nothing and all we do is subject them to that risk and the anxiety that comes along with it.

[02:30:22] So, um, anyway, that that's I I I'm I'm I'm eager to look at this because I do think that the proteom offers a lot, but um I'm always worried about going a little too far on the clinical implication of a test. I agree. I'm I'm with you in terms of being careful. I I view this as a as another attempt. And for example, you know, we talked about the the data showing that the two organs that appear to be rate limiting in terms of aging, the immune system and the brain, that came out of that that that story. These were that's actually title of the paper essentially that identifies the brain and the immune system. So they they have a whole series of immune immune markers that are predictive uh of you know some degree of immune activation and so on.

[02:31:08] Well, Eric, there's a lot of other things I wanted to chat about, but I think what we'll do is we'll have you come back out to Austin for another day of driving at Kota, and then we'll we'll we'll we'll justify it by doing another podcast where we dive deeper into some of these topics. We we really take advantage of the fact that we have the best raceourse in the country here in our backyard. So, absolutely.

[02:31:28] Um I think you're going to have fun tomorrow and good. You'll be like, "Let's come right back and do it again every month." I'm looking forward to this. Thank you, Eric. Thank you. [Music]

## Description

Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist & best-selling author known for distilling complex neuroscience & psychology into practical strategies for behavior change, performance, & decision-making. In this episode, Charles explores the neuroscience behind habit formation, including how cue-routine-reward loops drive nearly half of our daily actions & why positive reinforcement is far more effective than punishment. He explains how institutions like the military & Alcoholics Anonymous engineer environments to change behavior at scale, as well as discussing the limits of willpower & how to preserve it by shaping context. The conversation also covers the real timeline of habit formation, how to teach better habits to kids, the role of failure & self-compassion in lasting change, & the power of social accountability. Charles further discusses how cognitive routines enhance productivity & creativity, how to gamify long-term goals through immediate rewards, why identity & purpose are often the strongest forces behind sustainable behavior change, & the potential of AI to power habit change.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Charles, did you say negative reinforcement is 120th as effective as positive reinforcement? That's a staggering difference. It's a staggering difference. We can think of willpower as a muscle. And like all muscles, it gets stronger the more we practice using it, but it also gets fatigued in the short term.

[00:00:17] How do we form better habits or reformat maladaptive habits around that? Every habit in our life has three components. There is a cue, then there's a routine, and then there's a reward. What do those of us with young kids need to do? Teaching children a sense of agency when you bring home an A on your report card instead of saying, "Oh, you're so smart." Which is something you don't have control over to say, "Oh, you must have worked really, really hard."

[00:00:43] Because that's something you do have control over. When adding new habits with people, we tend to start very small. And the win is basically defined by showing up, not by any performance. The science of small wins. Regardless of how long it takes to build that habit or change a habit, every day you do it, it will get a little bit easier. Making the right choice is so much more powerful than executing really well on the wrong choice. Hey everyone, welcome to the

[00:01:11] Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia. [Music] Charles, thank you so much for making the trip out to Austin. Thank you for having me. This is such a treat. you know, in many ways, you're you're kind of the the OG guy when it comes to talking about habit formation. Um, and it's hard to believe, we were just talking a moment ago that it's been 13 years since your uh amazing book on the subject matter. Um, I probably read it eight years ago. Um, but it's a it's a topic that is relevant regardless of what you do. That said, for what I do and how I, you know, what my job is and how I try to sort of help people, it really comes down to uh knowing what to do and then putting it into practice.

[00:02:02] So, give folks a bit of a sense of your background and maybe even how that uh factored into you taking an interest in this topic. Yeah, absolutely. Um, so before I wrote the power of habit, uh I had been a a a reporter for quite a while and and a business reporter and a science reporter in particular.

[00:02:21] And I I decided to become a journalist after I went to Harvard Business School and I got my MBA. And about halfway through business school, I realized it's a lot more fun to write about business than to do it. So, so I decided to become a journalist. And one of the things that I noticed as I was writing,

[00:02:38] I was working at the New York Times at that point. One of the things I noticed because I had spent time overseas in Iraq during the war. I had reported on a bunch of different things and two I had two experiences that really got me interested in habits. The first is that when I was in Iraq, I got embedded with a unit that was that was right outside of um Baghdad and I was talking to a captain there. Actually, he was a major and I I was asking him how do you how do you train soldiers to become soldiers? Because one of the things that you see in a war zone in particular or anyone who spent time around the military is that the behaviors are so deeply ingrained, right? The goal is to ingrain a set of behaviors that if a bomb goes off, which happened underneath my car, everyone around you, the the 50, 18year-olds around you who probably don't know how to do anything with their lives, they know exactly what to do in that moment and they react automatically. And so I was talking to this major and he's this like little short guy and he kind of like, you know, really muscular. He chaws all the time. And I said, "How do you do this?" And he said, "Well, the thing you have to understand, son, because he called me son. The thing you have to understand is the military is a giant habit change machine. This is what we do. We teach young recruits who maybe don't have any self-discipline, maybe maybe you know are prone to emotional operas. We teach them the right habits and we've made a science of it. And when

[00:04:00] I came back to the US, I kind of had this experience where I was thinking about that and I was thinking to myself, if I'm so smart and so talented, right? If I have this great job and I win these awards, why can't I get myself to lose weight? like why can't I get myself to go running in the morning every day? Why is this such a struggle for me when I'm so good at other things? And I realized it was because I had not learned and studied how habits function and my own habits. And that once I learned that, I had the tools to change how I behave automatically, which is of course the most important component of our behavior because it's it's what we do every day.

[00:04:37] So you get back to the US what year? From from Iraq. Yeah. Uh let's see. I I was there 03 and 04. So So I get back at the end of 04, beginning of05. And I started at the New York Times. I was at the LA Times then. I started with the New York Times in '06. And then what did you start writing about? Did it like when did you pick that thread up again? And yeah, so it's um so I did this piece that was really fascinating to me. It was for I was writing for the business section of the times and I wrote a piece about the science of handwashing.

[00:05:08] There's been really really interesting research particularly out of um the United Kingdom about how do we incentivize people in developing nations to wash their hands because something that would happen and a lot of this was sponsored by Unilver the soap company. They found that people in poor communities particularly in

[00:05:27] India and Pakistan and in other parts of Asia would buy soap and then they would save the soap for special occasions. It was like something you gave to a guest when they came over. It was something that you you used before you went to mosque or for prayer. And so as a result they weren't washing their hands every day. And of course we know that using soap actually correlates with preventing a lot of diseases. And so a number of researchers in the UK took this on to try and figure out how do we create a soap habit, a handwashing habit using soap. And what they discovered was you need to be focus on the reward.

[00:06:03] Unilver and all the advertisements would talk about the benefits you got from using soap that if you used soap disease would go down. That was not influential, right? It's it's just like talking because it was too abstract. A couple of reasons. First of all, it was too abstract. Second of all, you're trying to educate people who don't think that they're at an education deficit, right? We see the same thing in the

[00:06:22] United States around vaccine resistance and other things. Telling people, "Oh, you're you don't know enough. I'm going to tell you the truth." That almost never works. What you have to do is you have to create incentives where you get an immediate reward for that behavior. And so what they did is they actually changed the scent of the soaps. They actually made the scent of the soaps less powerful because it seemed less like a perfume, less like a fancy thing. And then what they would do is they ran these ads where they equated washing your hands with taking care of your children. Not necessarily your own health, not your own cleanliness, but when I wash my hands with soap, I can feed my children. And so I'm creating that sense, that identity reward that says by doing this, you're a good parent. And that changed everything.

[00:07:11] Now, how long did it take them to figure out that that was the unlock? Was this iterative? What type of research did they have to do? I'm always intrigued by this type of problem. Yeah, absolutely. And there's really interesting papers if anyone wants to read them. It took them years. It and it it took a really sustained exposure. And what's interesting is part of this research and where it came out of was trying to understand the neural roots of disgust.

[00:07:38] Disgust is a really really powerful instinct that all humans have and and they really wanted to understand how do we capitalize on disgust as a negative reward. So they spent years on this. Um but but like everything that ends up having widespread change, it really paid off enormous dividend. By the way, when you say they, who are the types of people? Are these behavioral economists? Are they psychologists? sociologist. I'm I'm very intrigued by who who are the natural owners of this type of

[00:08:12] So there's a woman named Val Curtis who in particular led a lot of this research. Um and I hope I'm getting Val. It's been a little while since I read the research so I hope I'm getting Val's name right. But so Val led a lot of this research and I believe her background is in sociology. Um but they brought in this was during the heyday of behavioral economics when Danny Conaman and others

[00:08:33] Amos Traverski's work was really getting noticed for the first time and was making its way into other fields and so they brought in a lot of of the behavioral economists. They brought in a lot of psychologists because obviously that's what they're looking at. And I I think it points to something kind of interesting which is some of the most exciting research that's happening right now is this interdisciplinary research and and you know because you spent time in in the academy there there tend to get become these silos within universities but when you look at what's really interesting that's happening it tends to be the people who are stepping outside of those silos. Now, the way you described it a moment ago, it was more avoidance of negative that got the job done. Can we talk a little bit about, and I think we're going to come back to this over and over again, but the more examples we have, the better. You can almost think of like a 2 by two, positive and negative, giving and taking. Yeah. Right. So, give a carrot, uh, give a stick. Take away a carrot, take away a stick. This is like in my very simple framework take away a stick.

[00:09:37] Disgust is bad. We're going to remove disgust. How do you think about or what does the science tell us about that four square? I'll tell you what the research says and and just to give a little bit of context. The reason why this is important is because every habit that we have in our life and about 40 to 45% of what we do every day is habits. And this comes from research by Wendy Wood at

[00:09:57] USC. Every habit in our life has three components. There is a Q which is like a trigger for that behavior to start. Then there's a reward or then there's a routine which is the behavior itself, what we think of as the habit. And then there's a reward. Every habit in your life delivers a reward whether you're aware of it or not. And so you're right, there are negative rewards and there are positive rewards. But negative rewards and positive rewards act very differently. And to be most powerful often we have to put them in combination with each other. So let's start by talking about negative rewards.

[00:10:30] You would think that the threat of something unpleasant happening would be the most powerful negative reward. Peter, if you don't run today, I'm going to hit you with a cane, right? That's actually not what the science tells us. What the science tells us is that the best way to use negative rewards is to establish the pain and punishment prior to the behavior and then remove the tension of it afterwards. So, I'm going to give you an example. When I was in

[00:10:59] Iraq, one of the things that I learned about was the extraordinary interrogation techniques that were used by the military and stories came out that, you know, they would take people and terrorists and if they weren't they weren't giving them information, they would put them in a little box and and sort of lock them up in this physically uncomfortable position. That's not actually what happened. What happened is you capture the person, you put them in the box, and then you tell them, "I will let you out of the box if you give me the information I want." Right? The presence of a negative reward or a punishment is much more powerful when we feel it than when we anticipate it. When we put it that way, it makes sense.

[00:11:35] The problem is negative reinforcement is about 120th as effective as positive reinforcement. So, I have to hit you with a cane 20 times to equal the motivation that you'll feel if I let you have a really nice smoothie after you go for that run. Sorry, say that again, Charles. Did you say negative reinforcement is 120th as as effective as positive reinforcement?

[00:12:01] And we define effective as likely to produce the desired outcome. Yes. Yes. The the final 12th 120th I I would have guessed 1/2. Well, and I'm not saying that you're wrong. I'm just saying that's a staggering difference. It's a staggering difference and and it sometimes gets complicated by scale, right? because you might really hate getting hit by a cane a lot more than you enjoy drinking a smoothie. But we know that if those two things are comparable in your head, I'm going to have to hit you 20 times to equal the joy to equal the motivation you'll you'll find from drinking that smoothie.

[00:12:36] And that's a normal distribution, right? There's different behaviors and different different tolerances among individuals. But the reason why this is important is because when there are negative rewards or punishments available to us in the environment, then we should take advantage of those. Right? If I know that you feel a sense of disgust and I can take advantage of that to help you build a habit of washing your hands, I should go ahead and do so. But that's not enough on its own. I have to pair it with a positive reward. where I'm creating a scent in that soap that makes you feel like you're clean, that makes you feel like you're doing something virtuous. I have to re-emphasize to you, you're doing this for your kids. Every time you wash your hands with soap, you are a good parent.

[00:13:24] So that's the ice cream and taking the scent away, taking the flowery scent away is not hitting. Well, it's actually we're replacing it with a different scent. The problem with the flowery scent is that it's too associated with luxury. So, I need a scent that smells a little bit more medicinal to believe that it's doing its job.

[00:13:46] Interesting. Yeah. Uh let's shift gears just briefly and before we come back to this and think about it through the lens of parenting, right? Because that's the first thing that probably comes to many of our our listeners uh minds as we think about the words reinforcement, positive and negative reinforcement. So, your child is misbehaving.

[00:14:04] Mhm. uh you know bedtime routine is a disaster. They don't want to brush their teeth or whatever it is. There's a there's a punishment that you could allocate for that behavior. You could say, "Look, uh you know, Johnny, if you if you don't go to bed now, you do not get to play Xbox tomorrow, right? That's that's take, you know, that's a punishment. Um there's a reward, which is if you do this thing, I'm going to give you an extra 15 minutes of playing Xbox tomorrow." Yeah, based on what you just said, is it safe to say that offering 15 minutes of extra Xbox is significantly more likely to produce the desired outcome?

[00:14:45] Absolutely. And I think as parents, we know this. Any parent listening knows this, right? Your children, they're we're talking here about permanent behavior change, right? We we don't want them just to brush their teeth tonight. We want them to brush their teeth every night. a positive reward, positive reinforcement is going to be much more powerful at ingraining that po that habit in their life. Negative reward, it it might it might work tonight. Do do you have a sense of why this is from an evolutionary perspective? Because this seems awfully hardwired.

[00:15:14] Yeah, I so I think it has something to do the answer is I I I don't know exactly the answer to that and I'm not sure anyone does. I I'll tell you what the hypotheses that I've heard are. One of the things we know, as you know, is that our brain tends to overnotice negative Yes. outcomes, right? Yep. And and that's good because that means that, you know, if something can kill us, we're going to avoid it. But as a result, we actually are very good at at at discounting that reward very quickly. We have a very accurate mental representation of how painful a reward is going to be. and whether we should avoid it or not. Our sense of a negative reward, negative reinforcement is very finely tuned. Our sense of positive reinforcement is not.

[00:16:04] And as a result, there's an opportunity there to take advantage to kind of arbitrage that difference within our brain where when I give you a positive reward, you actually enjoy it more than you ought to. Right? Here's a great example. Um, we know this from slot machines that the way that a slot machine gets you hooked is they give you a consistent stream of rewards every 10, 15 minutes, every 10, 15 pulls and then they mix into that intermittent unexpected rewards because that unexpected reward gives me that dopamic reaction, that reward sensation much much bigger than the actual prize that

[00:16:42] I'm getting. And so what we can do, slot machines take advantage of it in a negative way, but we can take advantage of it in a positive way and say if I give you a reward, you're going to you're going to love it even more than you'll hate that punishment. And that gives me an opportunity. So now going back to the military example, how um how did you how did you come to understand the ways in which a myriad set of behaviors because as you said right like a soldier is able to do so many things that basically become autonomic um that might be very counterintuitive in fact might be counter to the value of your own life.

[00:17:23] Absolutely right. Like moving this direction as opposed to that direction under threat. Absolutely. Or or training people to kill which the many people have a natural reaction to not kill it. So how does the military do it? How do they employ this uh um reward punishment uh leverage? So one of the things that they do is they pay very very close attention to teaching cadetses to to respond to cues.

[00:17:51] So it one would think if I was saying okay if a bomb goes off what are you supposed to do right let's talk about the behavior that you do when a bomb goes off the thing about a bomb going off is that a bomb going off is a little bundle of cues and we need to talk about which cues you should pay attention to and which ones you shouldn't which ones should trigger an automatic behavior so in Iraq the issue with bombs going off

[00:18:14] IEDs was dust when there was an explosion of dust That is when you should react and we're going to practice that. So, we're going to take you out into the field and we're going to use ordinance that does not actually produce sounds, that does not produce fire. What we're going to do is we're going to put stuff in the ground that creates a huge cloud of dust and we're going to train you to react to that because we have found that dust is a more predictable and reliable indicator of when you should behave than the noise of an explosion or being able to see the fire. And to be clear, the noise could be coming from anywhere.

[00:18:49] You don't know where it's coming from. It could be a false alarm. It could be something that's a town away or something. Exactly. Right. And it's often times overwhelming. Uh the thing about like a visual stimuli in in this context is that it's very very recognizable. Whereas an audio stimuli, it's hard to tell. It's hard to localize, but it's also and it also sort of so overwhelms you that it can kick in that fight orflight instinct that we're trying to avoid. Okay, so that's the first thing that they do is they pay a lot of attention to cues and they think really really hard about that training. Um, in one of my other books, Smarter, Faster, Better, there's a chapter about uh boot camp for Marines and it's probably the most scientifically well finetuned training you will find on

[00:19:33] Earth because it takes in hundreds of thousands of people every year and we have to train them to be Marines. The other thing that they pay a lot of attention to is how do we reward that behavior in a way that will make it automatic. Right? We mentioned that a habit is a cue, a routine and a reward. That's known as the habit loop. But what happens in our brain to form that habit loop is that the part of our the basil ganglia which every animal on earth has a basil ganglia. The basil ganglia's job is essentially to make habits because without those habits we essentially can't evolve, right? Right? We just spend too much time in cognition.

[00:20:13] And what the basil ganglia helps encourage, and this is oversimplifying dramatically, but is it takes that cue, that routine, and that reward, and it puts them in a kind of circuit where the neural synapses connecting the behavior centers of those three items becomes thicker and thicker and thicker, which means that as a result, an electrical impulse can travel down that synapse faster. So if I'm the general, my goal is to take these soldiers and to change their brain so that when they see smoke, they react immediately, which is they pull out their gun, they look for the threat, they go through the mental checklist of look for these five things.

[00:20:51] And then I want to have a reward for them that's predictable and consistent. Now in that situation, there's not a natural reward. I have to create that reward. So, one of the things that I do is I have them train as a unit. And as soon as they all take position, they all say to each other, "Good job. Good job.

[00:21:09] I'm in position. Good job. Good job. Good job." They're all positively reinforcing each other. That becomes a reward that can build this behavior. Which is why looking at the unit or the platoon is so important in how we train soldiers is because oftentimes the rewards that are reinforcing our habits are social rewards that we're getting from other individuals. And during training, let's say it's the first day they're going through this drill and two of the guys fall out of formation, they fail to to get in position. The absence of being able to say, "Good job." Is that sufficient or is there also a punishment of, "Hey, you two guys, you were in the wrong spot. Let's go do it again."

[00:21:49] Well, it's the Marines, right? So certainly the drill sergeants um they have a certain reputation to uphold about about yelling at people. But no, it's actually but it's not doing that much. It's not really doing that much. It's helping people correct. It's it's creating it's creating sort of that instead of a wicked feedback system, a positive feed, a good feedback system where I'm learning very quickly, but it's actually me seeking out that reward. One of the things that you'll find if you look at surveys of why people fight, inevitably they will say, "I joined because of patriotism and I stayed in the military because of my because of camaraderie because of the guys next to me. I I couldn't go home. I couldn't I have to take care of them."

[00:22:30] That be and that's really encouraged by the military and that becomes the dominant overwhelming positive reinforcement is that you act for your fellow soldiers. And when one of them turns to you and says, "Good job, good job." What he's really saying is you helped protect me and I'm going to help protect you. And that feels amazing when you think about the number of people that make it through the various forms of training and whether it be

[00:22:54] Marines, special forces elsewhere, etc. Um are they screening for the capacity to be able to form these habits or is their point of view that we can basically instill this in anyone provided some basic set of criteria of aptitude or psychological well-being is present. It's the latter. It's latter. And and

[00:23:16] I'm kind of curious in your work how that plays out. That's exactly why I'm asking because what so what they what they believe and the science tells us this is true. Humans are habit machines, right? We we literally have evolved a brain that is fantastic at making habits. And so we can take almost anyone assuming a baseline physical readiness and and mental capacity. We can take anyone and we can teach them to be a good soldier.

[00:23:43] Now, some people are going to be elite soldiers, right? Some are going to become special forces. They might have an aptitude where they're more comfortable with willpower. They're more comfortable with grit. They're more comfortable experiencing discomfort. And so they might be able to create habits faster. They might understand sort of just intuitively or through learning how to affect their habits. But we can do this with anyone which actually I'm curious when someone comes to you and they are ex exert they are showing a a habitual behavior that you think is negative that they want to race and you want to race. Are there some people whom you believe like it's just not going to happen like I can't help this person?

[00:24:19] Well, the truth of the matter is I just don't think this is an area where I personally have enough expertise and therefore I'd be hesitant to judge the success or lack thereof for for a patient. Yeah. Because I don't think I'm a good enough coach, right? I'll tell you, I have a very very basic framework on habit.

[00:24:42] Um, which is one of the reasons I'm excited about this discussion is I I'm looking to bring many more insights into what we do. Um but the way I talk to patients about it is look there's there's broadly speaking additive and subtractive habits right so there are um if you're smoking if you're drinking too much um I I want to take away something right I want the the habit to be a habit of removal uh conversely let's say you don't exercise at all or you barely exercise and we want to increase the amount of exercise you do we want to add that thing in and so I I sort of have two different strategies for how to do that for the for the former it really comes down to default environment manipulation. Um so if a person wants to eat less junk food um my view is you have to actually take some pretty significant steps to reduce the amount of junk food that is around you. Absolutely.

[00:25:35] It sounds obvious and sometimes it's very difficult to do because if you don't control your environment it's hard. If you do control your environment it's it's easier. Um, and if you're in an intermediate state, you know, you have kids and the kids eat a lot of junk food and you're, you know, but but you don't want to be eating like the the mini wheats all the time, then it gets a little tougher. But you can exert sort of willpower for briefer stints. For example, when you're at the grocery store and you have to make the decision of what to buy. Um, but taking an easy example, if you live alone, if you're a single person, you you control the food environment in your house. And that might mean one hour a week you have to control your willpower when you're in the grocery store. Yeah. But if you do that, it gives you the luxury of being surrounded by healthy choices for the other 167 hours a week.

[00:26:22] Absolutely. And so that willpower muscle, you can either use it for other things or you can let it relax. You just have to flex it briefly. Yeah. On the other end of the spectrum, um, and and and again, this has always been my way of doing things and I don't think it's unique because I've I've read other people talk about the exact same idea.

[00:26:38] So clearly others have thought of this as well. Um when adding new habits with people we tend to start very small and the win is basically defined by showing up not by any performance. The science of small wins. Yeah. So so when a person hasn't if a person says I you know Peter I hate I I had this discussion two weeks ago right or last week actually. I don't I hate doing cardio Peter. I love strength training. Uh, I love being in the gym, but this whole zone 2 thing you want me to do, it's so painful.

[00:27:09] By the way, this speaks to my heart. Yeah. No. Yeah. And um and a patient said, "But but but Peter, you've convinced me. Like, I know I need to do this. I just don't want to." And I said, "No problem. Um, all I want you to do this week is three 15minute sessions on a stationary bike. I don't actually care how many watts you're pushing. I don't want you to wear a heart rate monitor. I don't want to I don't I don't want to track anything other than time. Can you get on for 15 minutes? I want you to pick your favorite podcast. And I've got some great recommendations for you. Um and I want you to just get on a stationary bike for 15 minutes, listen to this great podcast, and even if at the end of 15 minutes you want to ride more, don't.

[00:27:57] Just get off. I want you to do that three times. And then let's discuss that in a month. And um and and this tends to be a quite productive way to do it. Yeah. Um because then you can start to increase the duration and then you can start to add other parameters around performance. Okay, now we're going to actually start paying attention to the level of exertion and are we getting you in the right spot.

[00:28:17] But if I just try to say, all right, we're going to go from nothing to four hours of zone 2 a week in somebody who doesn't like it. The yeah, the likelihood of success is pretty low. So, there's a researcher Katie Milkman at the at Wharton um University of Pennsylvania who studied exactly what you're talking about quite extensively.

[00:28:34] How do we reward how do we link a reward to the behavior so that you're experiencing the reward during the behavior? And she actually uses audiobooks much like you use podcasts. And when she was doing this research, it was right when Harry Potter had come out. She loves Harry Potter. And so, she made a rule. She can only listen to the

[00:28:50] Harry Potter audio book when she's on the stationary bike. And she found that it just completely transformed her attitude towards doing this this behavior that she previously really did not like. Yeah. I mean, even for me, that is kind of the case. And and again, I'm far enough along in my journey in my life that I I'm those things have become so ingrained in me that I will do them. But there are days when I really don't feel like getting on a stationary bike because I do most of my zone 2 indoors um because it's easier frankly than trying to hold a constant level of output outdoors. And frankly some days it's just really boring. But there are two or three podcasts that I am addicted to and that's when I listen to them. So it's uh yeah I'm I actually am looking forward to listening to the podcast.

[00:29:37] That's and what my guess is and tell me if I'm getting if you think I'm wrong on this. My guess is that in addition to giving yourself a reward during that behavior, you're also rewarding yourself afterwards. Well, for me, the reward after is the feeling. Yeah. So, so, and again, I'd love to talk about this as it pertains to exercise. um you know Anna Lama who

[00:29:58] I'm sure you're familiar with her work um you know she talks about how for many people the discomfort of exercises creates that imbalance in in dopamine homeostasis such that post exercise many of us experience that subtle shift where we actually have if not a euphoria certainly a better feeling and so for me I always know that no matter how lousy I feel or how uninterested I am and it's usually that

[00:30:23] I'm just too busy usually It's I just want to do work for another hour. I don't really want to get on my bike, but I know that I'm getting this reward after of how I feel. Yeah. And what's interesting is what the research tells us, so that that's very real, right? The runner's high is a real thing. What's interesting is, and anyone who who once didn't exercise and now does exercise, who's listening, kind of knows this intuitively.

[00:30:47] The first couple of times that we tell someone to exercise, they do not anticipate the runner's high. And so as a result, it can't be a motiv. It's a difficult motivating factor. Right? My my mom hates exercise. And I always say, "You're going to feel so good afterwards." And she says, "You know what? I just don't feel good afterwards." I now she actually does feel good afterwards, but she tends to forget it. Right? She engages in hyperbolic discounting very actively around this positive reward. But one of the things that happens when we start exercising is that we convince ourselves that we're going to feel better afterwards. And so an exttrinsic reward like giving myself a nice smoothie, you know, congratulating me, calling Peter and he tells me you did such a good job for getting on the bike three times this week. That external reward moves to an internal reward where it's the it's the feeling of accomplishment and it's the runner's high, the euphoria that I'm getting that pushes that motivates my behavior. But I have to learn the value of that intrinsic reward because you usually can't convince me of it without me having experienced it. And so if you were to consider a group of 10 individuals who are similar in in most observable ways externally, right? Um and you you want all of them to create a new habit in a domain that is entirely foreign to them.

[00:32:04] Are there attributes of these people that would allow you to predict who is more likely to be successful? For example, does willpower, which might form the basis of the initial, you know, for lack of a better word, activation energy, getting over that hump the first few times, does that factor into it? I mean, truthfully, I don't even think I understand the science of willpower. So, maybe we can spend some time on that if if it's helpful. Um, the answer is absolutely. But I'm going to I'm going to caveat the answer by saying there are certainly behavioral characteristics that make it easier for some people to understand how to change their habits and adopt new habits. There does not seem to be a great deal of evidence that there's genetic reasons to predict that.

[00:32:47] Now, some researchers, some researchers will say there is slight genetic variations. We think that some people are more prone to willpower than others are, but it's so small and insignificant in comparison with the behavioral training that you have, right? The environment that you've grown up in. If you have parents who teach you willpower habits, if you're someone who is an athlete and so you have a team that's taught you how to push yourself a little bit harder when pushing yourself is hard, you already have an intuitive sense of how to adjust your own habits. And so as a result, if you're in a room with someone who has none of that background, they've never played on a team sport.

[00:33:25] Their parents let them do whatever they wanted. It's going to take me longer to change that second person's habits because I'm going to have to train them more. And the training just takes time. That makes sense. Okay. So low heritability. Yes. Exactly. High environmental and behavioral exposure as a child.

[00:33:41] Absolutely. Absolutely. And the and the research is pretty consistent on that. So, not to digress, but again, I think a lot of people in our audience are parents. And so, I mean, this sounds like just good parenting 101, but let's double click on it a little bit. What do those of us with young kids need to do to enable our kids to become the type of adults who can make behavior changes and create better habits? So the single most powerful thing we can do is we can teach them how willpower works and to build willpower habits because a willpower habit actually doesn't tax the the metaphor of the muscle of the will willpower muscle that exists inside our head.

[00:34:21] And so Angela Duckworth who probably many of your listeners are familiar with because of grit she's done a lot of research on this. One of the things that's really powerful is to explain and demonstrate to kids how to diagnose the Q routine and reward. so that they can begin editing their own habits. So, I have a 14-year-old and a 17-year-old. And one of the things that I do is I'm very ostentatious in how I reward myself for hard behavior, right? And this this is actually kind of counterintuitive because we're we're dads. We're supposed to be stoic, right? We go out and we run a half marathon and like it's no big deal. We don't we don't So, what I do is exactly the opposite. I go out and I run not even a half marathon. I just go and

[00:35:02] I run four or five miles and I come home and I say to my kids, "Oh man, that was a hard run, but I pushed through it. Now, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to have this really yummy smoothie I've been looking forward to. For the next 15 or 20 minutes, I'm just going to lay on the couch and enjoy myself cuz I feel so good right now." What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to model for them.

[00:35:20] Giving yourself a reward, focusing on that reward is a powerful way to reinforce or change your own behavior. And I'll do the same thing with cues. oftentimes some of the cues that I use for exercise or for other things are aren't visible to my children because I'm, you know, putting my running shoes next to my bed so I see them when I wake up in the morning and they don't understand the significance of that or or I'm I'm do doing engaged in a in a sort of ritual before I start writing that they don't see. So what I'll do is

[00:35:50] I'll be very explicit with them and say, you know what, I I need to start writing in 15 minutes. here's what I'm going to do for the next 15 minutes to get ready for that. I'm teaching them think about the cues in your life. Think about the rewards in your life. If you focus on those two things, you can create almost any routine, any behavior that you want or change any behavior that you want. So the Q's in that sense are just as important for the positive behaviors as the negatives. I I think many of us probably associate Q's with negative, meaning be aware of the Q, right? If I'm trying to quit smoking, what's my cue to smoke? How do I need to spot it in advance? But you're paying just as much attention to it's funny. I don't know that I really think of cues on my positive behaviors, but I'm sure I know they're there. I guess if I was looking at your life, I I bet you Okay, so let me ask you before you work out, what do you do? What do you do before you work out?

[00:36:43] Make my electrolyte drink. Okay, so that's a preceding behavior. Ritualized behavior that's become a cue for you. And and it's not a negative cue, right? It's do you look forward to making that? Like does it feel like a little sense of like anticipation as you're making it? Like I'm gonna go work out. I'm gonna

[00:37:00] No. Because interestingly and people will be so surprised to know this about me, but at least in for the past year or two, I feel I'm so busy that I don't have the desire to work out until I'm in the gym. That's interesting. Or on the bike. So, in other words, it used to be that I couldn't wait to work out, but something has happened in the last 2 years where I really have to kick myself into the gym. Now, when I'm 15 minutes in, I feel great and I'm delighted to be there, and there's nowhere I'd rather be. But the 15 minutes before I go into the gym, which includes making that drink, extracting myself away from my computer and doing my warm-up, I'm like, that is that is actually it feels like pure willpower.

[00:37:47] But also, I guess I benefit from enough muscle memory of just I've done this my whole life. Um, but but I'm trying to I guess I'd have to think about that. Let me let me posit a hypothesis and you can tell me if you think this is right. My guess is that that preceding behavior of making the electrolyte drink and doing the stretches, that was a very ineffective cue at one point in your life and the effectiveness of that queue has diminished over time, but you found other cues, which is that a sense of antic, one of it might just be a sense of anticipation that you're going to feel good after 15 minutes.

[00:38:18] I think that's a lot of it. Yeah. Yeah. It might also be that you know that you're going to put on your podcast. And so like the the cue of hitting start on the podcast is what gets your head in that place where you can start exercising and then experience. That's interesting. I only do the podcast for zone 2.

[00:38:32] Okay. The only thing for in the gym for some reason I can't lift weights and concentrate on something else. That's fascinating. So I listen to music in the gym which doesn't get me excited. And that would that would actually suggest that you are using more willpower in the gym. Y that that because that muscle will this is a an exact metaphor but we can think of willpower as a muscle and like all muscles it gets stronger the more we practice using it but it also gets fatigued in the short term.

[00:39:01] Mhm. And so this is why if you look at um if you look at data on when accidents happen in surgery, they most often happen when a surgeon has been either in his second or third surgery or her second or third surgery or when it's a very long surgery. Right? They've been using their willpower for so long they get fatigued. If you look at the number of affairs that happen among lawyers and doctors, they most often happen when someone has been at the office after 9 or 9:30. And for years, people thought, oh, you get to the evening and it's like kind of romantic. No, it's that after 9 or 10 hours of exerting your willpower in your office, your guard is down. Your muscle is weaker.

[00:39:40] And so when someone comes up and they kiss you, instead of pushing them away, you kiss them back. Thinking about our willpower muscle, both strengthening it, but also protecting it when we need it, is critical to being able to be the people that we want to be. And so part of that then is recognizing when you're vulnerable.

[00:39:58] Yes. So you're and I mean you used an extreme example of having an affair but also vulnerable to uh fall. So so let's use a less extreme example of um I really want to eat less dessert. Yeah. Right. I really just want to eat less dessert. Let's use smoking. Okay. Smoking is a great one because the James

[00:40:16] Prochaska at the University of Rhode Island has spent his whole career and like the data that we have on smoking sessation is enormous. It vastly outpaces almost everything else. Yeah. Okay. So, let's talk about what happens. Nicotine, as you know, um is an addictive substance, but we're only addicted to nicotine for about 100 hours after our last cigarette. By that point, nicotine is out of our bloodstream.

[00:40:40] Like, we don't have a physical dependency on nicotine. And yet, we all know people who crave who smoked for years, quit, and they crave a cigarette a decade later after they have breakfast in the morning. Let's I So, I didn't I didn't actually know that, Charles. So 4 days after you smoked your last cigarette or had your last exposure to nicotine, you stronger have a physiologic need for nicotine.

[00:41:05] Yeah. It's out of your you you have you have completed withdrawal. That is that that is I had no idea of that. But what you still have you still have the queue. You still you still have and you remember the reward. Right. Exactly. The habit the habit loop still exists in your brain. Like if you have a if you have a cigarette with every morning cup of coffee, as soon as you pick up that c cup of coffee, your brain is craving that nicotine and that feels just like an addiction, a physical addiction. In fact, it's in some ways more powerful than a physical addiction.

[00:41:36] And so, so what so what Prosca did is he looked at how people quit smoking. And this gets to the point you were raising before about learning. He found that on average a smoker needs to quit seven times in order to actually quit. So, so a committed smoker, somebody who's been smoking for years, they will give up cigarettes seven times before it actually works. Which raises this kind of interesting question. What is happening in those seven times? Like why seven instead of four? What's happening?

[00:42:08] What the research tells us is that the first time I give up cigarettes, I focus on willpower, right? Right? I say like, I'm going to resist. I'm going to resist these cigarettes. I I'm throwing them out. I'm going to change my environment a little bit, but all those cues are still there. The craving for the reward is still there. And when my willpower gets taxed, my mother-in-law comes to town, I've had a really tough day at work, my willpower is really my muscle, that muscle has been exercised all day, that's the moment that I give in and I pick up a cigarette and I say, "To hell with it. I'm going to start smoking again." And just to be clear is what happens when you have that first cigarette? Why can you not on that first cigarette go, "Hey, it was just a lapse.

[00:42:48] I'm exhausted. Tomorrow's a new day." Well, it's because you don't have a plan. Right? So, you're caught off guard by this relapse. And as a result, it tends to shake our faith in ourselves. Even if it's almost subconscious, it tends to shake our faith in ourselves that we can't quit. Now, that's the first time.

[00:43:05] That's super. So, so I just want to interject here. This is something that we try to talk a lot to our patients about, which is um except because again, we're not dealing with something that's as binary as smoking. Let's just say it's exercise and you're like, we've set a plan that you're going to do something for 30 minutes every day and then you're going to have that day when you don't.

[00:43:25] What we tend to spend a lot of time coaching on is absolutely positively under no circumstance do you judge yourself for that day. and the next day just get back on the horse and don't let two don't let one bad day be two and then it's fine because I think what we see is a lot of times a person will go six days of an you know of their routine they miss a day they beat themselves up and then they're done they're like well forget it I screwed up and or you know it can happen in the reverse yeah well and it makes sense right because we we're talking about rewards and positive rewards and negative rewards I miss a day and I start beating up on myself I'm flooding my my brain with negative rewards, with recriminations, with feelings of shame.

[00:44:08] My brain pays attention to what gives me positive rewards and negative rewards. And it's saying this exercise thing, it's a sucker's game because even if I feel good for a couple of days, I'm going to feel terrible after when I miss it. So, you're exactly right. We cannot engage in that self-lame. So, this poor smoker, this poor smoker, his his mother-in-law who nags him comes into town.

[00:44:28] He's his willpower is exhausted. He's been dealing with her all day long. He grabs his, he lights up, sneaks outside in shame. Yes. So, here's what happens. You do that once, you do that twice, you do it three times. Here's what starts happening around the third or fourth time. And this is what gets to your exerciser as well. Suddenly, people stop looking at it as a moral lapse and they start looking at it as a scientific experiment. Okay, here's the data that

[00:44:53] I've observed. I do a pretty good job of avoiding cigarettes until something really stressful happens. Mhm. So, I need to ahead of time figure out when that stressful thing occurs, what am I going to do instead of smoking? Because if I don't have a plan in place, what's known as an implementation intention. If I don't have a plan in place, I'm going to pick up the cigarettes. So, here's my plan. Instead of beating up on myself, I'm going to write down that the next time my mother-in-law comes to town, I am going to have some sweet candy in the house because I know that I I'm going to have an urge to put something in my mouth.

[00:45:26] I'm going to want some type of quick boost reward and sugar can provide that to me. The novelty of taste. I'm going to have that candy in my house and when she's driving me crazy, I'm going to walk over pick up a piece of candy and go outside and eat it. So what happens is that over time, the reason why it takes seven times to quit smoking or the reason why your your clients and your patients have these re these moments of of willpower failure is because instead of looking at that as a failure, we have to look at ourselves as scientists who are conducting experiments and paying attention to the data. And my wife is a scientist and you're a scientist. So, you know, if every experiment that a scientist does succeeds, they're a terrible scientist, right? Right. The goal is to figure out where it succeeds and where it fails and learn from the failures. We have to look at our own lives that same way and say, "I meant to go run today and I didn't. Let me try and figure out why." And then I'll come up with a plan for the next time. The next time this obstacle emerges, I know what to do without having to worry about it. And is it the case you think that that people are able to kind of do that on their own or is this the enormous opportunity to to coach a person through that and say, you know, to create an accountability partner, for example, and say, look,

[00:46:46] I want to hear about it when you fail just as much as I want to hear about it when you succeed. And when you fail, I'm going to direct all of the inquiry towards learning. What did you learn? what can we you know that's in it's incredibly powerful because it's going to speed up that that feedback loop right now now there are some people there are people who quit smoking on their own without ever talking to another person about quitting smoking right but those so these guys are the outliers there they're absolutely the outliers and it's taken them longer to actually quit than someone who takes advantage of the social the social aspect of habit formation where I know that I can get rewards and I can get learnings from other people in my life more effectively than I can then I can find it in myself.

[00:47:27] The the truth of the matter is let's take alcohol as an example because AA is such a a wellstied and interesting model. There are lots of people who engage in what's known as spontaneous recovery where they will try and quit drinking and they'll relapse and quit drinking and eventually they stop drinking. But people who engage in AA because it's basically habit replacement, those people end up quitting drinking much faster. So, we all have the capacity to do this on our own, but when we do it in an environment where we know that we're we're taking advantage of the cues and rewards that make behavior change easier, it goes faster and it feels better.

[00:48:05] What is the um overall success of AA for alcohol abstinence or uh I mean I guess AI does not support harm reduction. It's really about abstinence, right? That's absolutely right. Yeah. So, so we don't know the AA is very extensively studied, but because it's anonymous, we don't have double blind studies. We don't have a lot of longitudinal data.

[00:48:30] That being said, the estimates seem to be that for about 40% of people who come into AA, they can achieve lifelong abstinence if they if that's their goal. And 40% isn't great, right? That still means 60% of people, but but it it's pretty good for behavior change. Yeah. Um and and so what's interesting about AA is AA much like the military is built around asking people to identify the cues and rewards in their life and then changing the behavior that corresponds to that old queue and finding a new behavior that delivers something similar to that old reward.

[00:49:05] There's the the 10 principles of AA the reason why there's 10 of them is because there's 10 commandments in the Bible. The bill Bill W the guy who came up with AA he had no training in psychology or science. whatsoever. The thing that makes AA successful is that when you walk in, you stand up and you say, "My name is Charles and I'm an alcoholic." And then at some point, you tell your story. And when you're telling your story, you're reminding yourself of all the cues that prompt you to drink.

[00:49:35] One of the steps is I make amends. I go to all the people that I've wronged. That that teaches me what those cues are. I'm learning. I'm looking at my life as a scientist. And then often times the reward for drinking is a relaxed socialized experience. So when you go to an AA meeting, you have a relaxed socialized experience. Absent alcohol, but you're talking to other people. You're com you're communing with other people. The same thing you get at a bar. Aa is a habit change machine that doesn't doesn't have to to express itself that way. And I don't know much about AA, but the little bit I know suggests that people will go for life.

[00:50:15] They might not go as frequently, but but they're they're going to I know people that are have been sober for 20 years that are still going to a meeting twice a week. You're exactly right. You're exactly right. So So often times people will develop a habitualized behavior around AA and they keep up with that habit for life. Just as frequent and actually more frequent is that people will commit to

[00:50:35] AA. They say like 90 day 90 meetings in 90 days. Yeah. So they'll commit to AA at the beginning and then it will taper down over time. They'll start going to one meeting a week and then one meeting a month and then you know they move to a new place and they don't know where the new meeting is. But what they have learned is when I'm in that moment where I think

[00:50:55] I'm going to relapse, where my willpower muscle seems tired, where the cues around me are prompting me to drink, I'm going to go to a meeting instead of go to a bar. And so the AA, even if I'm not going consistently, if it's ingrained in my psychology as a way to avoid drinking, it's very, very powerful. And

[00:51:13] I can activate that any time in life. So let's go back to childhood. Sure. Because I think this is such an interesting place, right, where I mean, maybe I'm incorrect, but I'm assuming that again, a lot of these seeds are sewn in how we're raised. Um, and in the case of your kids, they're getting actually kind of like a master class because they've got, you know, a parent who's one of the world's experts in it, but who also they would also they would not say it was a master class. They would say I'm a little heavy-handed, but but thank you for that.

[00:51:43] But but but you're being deliberate in how you're in how you're coaching. Um, so, uh, again, for those of us who who who want to kind of take a bit of that because I, you know, I really think like people always ask me like, "What do you want for your kids?" And and that's an interesting question, right? Like I certainly don't

[00:52:03] I don't have any aspiration for what I want them to be professionally. Like it's not like oh I want this kid to be that and this kid to be that. I mean you want your kids to be well adjusted and happy. Yeah. Um but it's hard to imagine them doing that if they don't have some command and control over themselves. So that you could argue that this is one of the most important things that we want our kids to have.

[00:52:28] Yeah. And yet I don't feel like we have any adequacy in the training for it. I think you're right. I think that this is something if if this was more of a curriculum in schools, if it was something we taught parents, and that's one of the reasons I wrote the power of habit is I wanted to I wanted to empower parents to teach their own kids this to recognize things in their own life. Um I think that a number of us understand intuitively some aspect of this, right?

[00:52:52] So a lot has been written about the growth mindset, Carol Dwek's work out of Stanford. You know, one of the things that she emphasizes is teaching children a sense of agency that instead of saying when you bring home an A on your report card, instead of saying, "Oh, you're so smart," which is something you don't have control over, to say, "Oh, you must have worked really, really hard because that's something you do have control over. I'm reinforcing your sense of agency." When we do that intuitively or deliberately, one of the things that we're doing is we're teaching our children that they have control over their habits. Right? you went and you worked really hard to get that A.

[00:53:30] You developed a habit of studying. You used your willpower. I'm going to positively reinforce that by recognizing it. Whereas, if I say, "You must be really smart. You got that A." I'm not positively reinforcing your belief that you can change your behavior. So in addition to explaining to kids and being ostentatious, showing off the cues and rewards in our own life and how we change our own habits, the way that we give rewards to our children also reinforces for them whether they believe that they are in control of their willpower or not.

[00:54:00] And I suppose the other side of that is um how do we hand handle our own failures in front of them? Absolutely. Do we do we even admit our own failures? Right. There's a there's a model of fatherhood from the 1950s that you don't burden your family with your ups and downs. Dad's a steady rock. But all the research tells us one of the best things you can do is if you screwed up, and I tried to do this all the time. I come home and I'm like, "Oh man, I called this guy today and I just completely screwed up this interview because I want them to know." And then I say, "But the thing I realized from it is that next time I call, I need to have something to eat before I call because that's going to help me." I'm modeling for them. A failure is not a failure. A failure is a data point and I'm a scientist about my own life. What do we know about the length of time or the amount of friction it takes to create a habit and the difficulty in breaking it? So maybe that doesn't make sense. I'll try to come up with an example. Um, if it takes a long time to really create a habit around exercise or meditation, let's pick something new. Okay. So, you know, not a not an easy thing to do, right? But but let's say over years and years and years, you take a lot of time to build that memory, that muscle memory up. I assume that's creating some sort of physiologic headroom that makes it much harder for you to erode that down.

[00:55:30] Yes, absolutely. So what's happening when you're meditating is that as we mentioned there's these neural neural synapses neural pathways that connect the synapses associated with the cue and the routine and the reward they're becoming thicker and thicker and thicker over time. What's interesting is they almost never become significantly thinner. So if you develop a meditation habit and then you stop meditating your life changes the cues when you come back to meditation you will fall back into it much more quickly than the average person.

[00:56:02] So we know that creating habits both good and bad creates this neural pathway that we need to be conscious of. But to your question of how long does it take the answer is we actually don't know. There's this like old there's this myth or this old wives tale that you know it takes 21 days to build a habit and it takes 30 days to break a habit. What the research tells us is that there is no number because different people have different thresholds and different kinds of habits have different timelines associated with them. If you want to create a habit of eating chocolate, you can probably do it in a couple days, right? Like it's an immediate it's an immediate positive response. You if you like chocolate, it's something you enjoy. the cues are plentiful around you. You just put chocolate bars in your house. But if you want to build an exercise habit, it's going to take a little bit longer.

[00:56:51] But here's the important thing is that regardless of how long it takes to build that habit or change a habit every day you do it, it will get a little bit easier. And you might not feel that increase in ease the first couple of days, right? But what's going to happen is I'm going to push myself to exercise day 1, day two, day three. I'm going to relapse on day four. I'm going to not do it. instead of beating up on myself, I'm going to look for the science to what what what went wrong here? What's my plan for next time? And then I get to day 12 or I get to day 20 or I get to day 365 and it occurs to me actually exercising is really easy for me now. Like I hardly even think about it. It just happens almost kind of automatically. I now what about the negatives?

[00:57:31] Right? So if you take two individuals, one who has been smoking for a year, a pack a day for a year, and one who has been smoking a pack a day for 20 years, is it necessarily the case that the latter is going to have a much more difficult time quitting? Probably. Um because it's a much more ingrained behavior.

[00:57:53] But this is where individual differences come into play significantly because if that per first person if they're an athlete, if they've worked on other habits in their life, if they've if they've strengthened that muscle around habit change, they might be able to rely on that to give up smoking. Whereas the 20 20 year smoker doesn't.

[00:58:14] But but yes, in general, the longer and more consistent a behavior becomes, the more reinforced it becomes in our brain. And does that mean that let's just assume both of these individuals are able to quit smoking? Yeah. It's five years later, both of them are at a bar and they both light up a cigarette.

[00:58:33] Are they both equally susceptible to relapse or is the 20-year person more susceptible because his uh neural connections are more hardwired? Well, there's a lot of compounding factors there, right? So, so when the when when the 20-year-old smoker lights up his cigarette, we're focusing on the habit loop associated with nicotine use, but there's probably other habit loops that he has developed over time, which is he might feel much more intense sense of shame over smoking than the one-year smoker. He might have emphyma or developing behav and and those are creating mental habits for him that are counterveiling the the positive reinforcement of the nicotine. So the answer to your question is it's really hard to say universally.

[00:59:20] What we do know is that the more consistent a reward, whether it's a reward that rewards a positive behavior or a negative behavior, the more consistent that reward and the more consistent that cue, the faster the habit will take hold and the stronger the grip it'll have on us. But when we're trying to change it or create a new habit, there's so many other variables that we don't we can't predict how long it's going to take. But we do know that any habit can be changed.

[00:59:47] Is there a rule of thumb that says on average it is more or less difficult to break habits than to create habits? So So the science doesn't sort of address that question. What we do know is that it takes a different technique to build a new habit than to change an old habit. Right? So if I want to build a new habit, if I want to start running, what I need to do is I need to sit down just come up tell come up with a cue, come up with a reward. Okay, my Q is and by the way, all QES fall into one of five categories. It's a time of day, a particular place or environment, it's a certain emotion you feel, it's the presence of certain other people, or it's a preceding behavior that's become ritualized. So tomorrow I want to start running. I've never run before. I'm gonna I'm gonna take advantage of as many of those as I can. Right? So, my plan is set my alarm for 7 o'clock. I want to be out the door by 7:30 running and I'm gonna put my running shoes and my running clothes on my floor next to my bed so I see them when I wake up.

[01:00:47] It's super easy to put them on. I know what I'm going to wear. I'm going to ask my friend Jim to meet me on the corner. We're going to run together. I'm creating as many cues as I can. If you can tap into all five, you're you're some of them are going to stick. Yep. And then when I get home, I have already decided what reward I'm going to give myself. I'm going to have a nice long shower. I'm going to drink a smoothie. I'm going to take 15 minutes to check social media or whatever else sort of delights me.

[01:01:13] So that's how we build a new habit is we choose a cue and we choose a reward and we link it to a behavior we want to encourage. But for a bad habit, a habit that we want to extinguish, our nomenclature is incorrect. We often talk about breaking a bad habit, but because that neural pathway exists in our brain, I I've smoked for 20 years. I can't just extinguish that those neural connections. What I need to do is instead of thinking about breaking that habit or extinguishing it, I have to think about changing that habit. And in that case, what I do is I identify the cue that prompts this behavior I want to change. I identify the reward that that behavior is giving me. And I'm gonna simply insert a new behavior that corresponds to that old Q that delivers something similar to that old reward and I'm I'm going to let my brain eventually shift keep the habit loop inside my head but change the behavior the routine.

[01:02:12] Yeah, this is I mean I I just like I love this framework so much. Right. So let's um let's go back to the first one. Okay, because it has so much applicability, right? So new habit want to do want to do something new. You've identified what the behavior is. That's the thing. Y the playbook is pretty straightforward.

[01:02:30] I got to come up with as many cues as possible. So if I'm going to do single Q, not that likely I'll succeed out of the gate, but boy, you get five of them, four out of five of them, it's great. And obviously some of them are more than others. So I know for our patients, the cues that tend to be very powerful are other people. People never want to let people down, right? So, we always think that one of the most powerful cues is an accountability partner.

[01:02:54] Um, sometimes we have people that literally hire trainers for the sole purpose that they they don't want to be embarrassed that they've not shown up. That the only You're kind of disappointing me right now. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, but you're right. Yeah. The more cues that we can come up with, the better. And some are will have more salience than others.

[01:03:13] Yeah. But we sort of we we'll play with that and figure out which which ones work for us. And then how do you help a person think about how to gauge the magnitude of the reward? Because you know, here's an area where you could get a little extreme. Yes. Um, yeah, I'm not going to I'm not going to embarrass myself with examples of things

[01:03:33] I've done in this department, but uh my wife could tell you some really embarrassing stories of how Peter can reward himself at times. Yes. Exactly. So, so the first thing to do is to say I have to give myself a reward, which is actually harder than it sounds. So, if you think about how most people start exercising, instead of having this like I'm going to take a nice shower and I'm going to eat a drink smoothie, they go for a run and they get home and they're late right now. Now,

[01:04:00] I'm rushing. I'm taking as quick a shower as I can cuz I got to throw breakfast on the table for the kids and I'm going to I'm running late to take them to school. I'm actually punishing myself for exercising. And my brain pays attention to that punishment and says, "I don't want to exercise anymore. This is this is a sucker's game." So, the first and most important step is to actually recognize I have to reward myself and I have to create the time or the space or the resources to let myself have that reward and enjoy that reward.

[01:04:28] Now, the next question that you asked, how big should it be? Yeah. One of the things that we know is that one of the most powerful impacts on this is how immediate that reward is. That in general, if I give myself a reward right away, if I eat sugar and it tastes good as it gives me that boost as soon as it hits my tongue, that's going to be a more powerful reinforcement than if it's something where I'm working out every day and 3 weeks from now my muscles are going to be stronger. So, the more immediate we can make the reward at first, the better. And we can often times have a smaller reward if it happens quickly than having to have a bigger reward that comes later in time.

[01:05:10] Now I mentioned though that this is at first and this is really important because as I mentioned before what happens with rewards is they almost always if a behavior becomes a habit they almost always move from exttrinsic to intrinsic. Right? So, at first the reward I'm giving myself is I'm letting myself have a smoothie. And that smoothie might not be that healthy.

[01:05:32] You have got me very curious about your smoothie situation. You You bring it up a lot. I There's something going on in Santa Barbara. So, I'll tell Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz. Santa Cruz. So, I'll tell you. I um I love smoothies. I put peanut butter in my smoothie, which you're not supposed right. That's like I'm taking all this healthiness and

[01:05:50] I'm erasing it by putting the peanut because I've already got protein powder in there. I don't need any more protein. But but from to to your point, I'm I'm increasing the magnitude of the reward that I get from this this particular reward. But over time, as you mentioned, what's going to happen is your craving for that smoothie is going to go down as your brain begins to realize, oh, actually, when I run, I feel great afterwards. I feel endorphins. I feel dopamine. I feel these endocanaboids.

[01:06:17] Right? There's this kind of like there's this soup of good feeling in my head. your brain starts saying,"I don't actually need the smoothie. I don't crave crave the smoothie quite as much. I don't need that smoothie because I just I feel good afterwards. That's the reward." So, the reward has moved from exttrinsic to intrinsic.

[01:06:33] And that's a really important transition because that means the behavior becomes self-reinforcing without external rewards. So, let's think of um a behavior where there is absolutely positively no obvious link to a short-term reward. So, we're going to have to fabricate one. Yep. Does it need to make sense? Here's So, so the smoothie kind of makes sense after the run because you are glycogen depleted. That's the perfect time to have a smoothie. You're most insulin sensitive. You actually can dispose of glucose the most easiest. If you're going to have a smoothie any time of day, that's the time to have it. Okay.

[01:07:12] Now, I come to you and I say, "Charles, I'm 3 years out of college. I technically make enough money that I could start putting money into my 401k. I just don't want to, man. Cuz honestly, like I know my employer matches and I know that it's leverage dollars and I know all the intellectual reasons why, but the truth of the matter is if I start putting money into this 401k, I have less money to buy things now.

[01:07:40] Absolutely. So, and it's going to pay off in 40 years. It's hard for me to get excited about 40 years from now. Yeah. So, how would you coach me into making that decision, especially around the cues and the rewards? Yeah, it's I love this question because there's actually been a bunch of research on this particularly out of researchers at at University of

[01:08:04] Pennsylvania, Wharton. So, what they did is they went into a comm a series of communities in South America and they asked this exact question. How do we get people particularly people and the reason why they were in South America is because they wanted people who were in a cash-based economy where there wasn't a lot of credit cards? How do we get people to save more, increase their savings rates when we know that the reward for savings is oftent times far off in the distance, particularly if you're low income? So, they had they had two groups. the control group, they would they set up a a a box for them that they could put savings into. And they said, "We'd like you once a week to come in and save some money. And by the way, we're going to tell you all the good reasons to save, right? You should save because eventually you want to send your kids to college or you want to buy that new truck and we're going to help you. We're going to help you. We're going to have a saving device for you."

[01:08:54] That's the control group. With the experimental group, they do the exact same thing except there is a secretary who works in that bank who every single time someone comes in and they put money into that that box, they say, "Man, I'm this is the fourth week in a row you've come in. I'm so impressed to see you."

[01:09:10] You know, your kids are going to your kids are going to go to college. They're going to be amazing kids. Like I just think about like someday in the future like they're going to buy you a new home. This is going to be you are a great parent. The second group, the experimental group, savings rent rate went up over 40%. They were saving 40% more money than the first group. No, not a bigger payoff. Simply someone positively reinforcing. So what happened there?

[01:09:37] It's a long-term behavior, but we need short-term rewards. And so the researchers were manufacturing a short-term reward in the form of social reinforcement. Has the following experiment been done as an extension of that where you have a third arm that gets the same reinforcement for a period of time and then the secretary goes away after x number of months to see if the shift from exttrinsic to intrinsic maintains the same savings rate.

[01:10:07] So I haven't seen that experiment in this particular setting but in other settings absolutely. And what is the period of time that you need to move to remove the exttrinsic reward and make it intrinsic? I think it would probably depend on the type of habit we're talking about and the type of individual. Right. That's there's not one answer.

[01:10:26] Yeah, I don't think there's one answer, but we do know that at some point it will move from exttrinsic to intrinsic. Um, and one of the things we do know is that social rewards actually become intrinsic much faster. that if I start working out and I know that Peter's going to tell me I'm doing a great job and I look forward to that eventually. That sense of pride that I feel, I'm just going to get it without you having to tell me I'm doing a great job. Right? Social re social reinforcement, social rewards, sense of pride, particularly mental habits become intrinsic much much faster. And so that's some that's something we can leverage. We can use those social rewards to go move from exttrinsic to intrinsic. What other ways are there besides social reinforcement to reward very long-term behaviors like savings?

[01:11:11] So, I'll tell you what I do. So, um I uh I have a spreadsheet. I've had it for seven or eight years now. And I use Simplify. I used to use Mint. I use Vanguard. I have, you know, different all the websites that sort of consolidate all my financial information. Once a week, it takes me about 15 minutes. I update my spreadsheet. I create a brand new set for this week. I input all the numbers.

[01:11:37] Here's my bank balance. Here's my Vanguard balance. Here's my private equity balance. And then I look at whether it's gone up or down. And you know what? I love it. I I look forward to this. Many times it's going down based on the stock market. Absolutely. And when it's going down is when I tend to like not do it, right?

[01:11:55] Because because part of my brain knows like, ah, the market's down. I just don't want to even be reminded of it. I'm going to wait another What is the frequency at which you save money? Do you have an automatic uh every one week or every month I am automatically mindlessly without thinking about it putting X dollars into the answer is yes it's it because my income is more stokatic because I I I write and and do things that deliver outsized rewards sometimes and sort of long periods without reward.

[01:12:20] Um but yes absolutely any but it's based on a percentage of what comes in and again anything that comes in any new money that comes in goes immediately into my Vanguard account and I've never taken money out of my Vanguard account. What is it specifically, Charles, that you are getting rewarded by if the number isn't monotonically going up? What is giving you the joy?

[01:12:40] What's giving me the joy is I feel a real sense of responsibility and I feel a relief from tension. We mentioned before that one of the most powerful rewards is relieving tension. I put you in the box and I tell you if you give me information, you can come out of the box. I'll remove the tension. And for me, particularly someone who, you know, when I went to HBS and I became a journalist, I I was the lowest paid member of my class for the next seven years. I mean, there's been I started a company before I became journalist. I used to sell blood in order to make payroll, right? Like money insecurity for me is a real thing. Mh.

[01:13:15] And to look at that spreadsheet and say like, "Ah, it went down by, you know, 2% this this month, but it's okay cuz that number that number in the bottom is still big enough that I don't have to worry." That that relief of tension is enough of a positive reinforcement to make saving a really positive experience for me. And here's the other thing that I do in that spreadsheet. I say, "Here's how much money I've made in the last year. Here's how much money I've made in the last two years. Here's how much money I've made in the last three years." And I have those right next to what my total net worth is because even if my net worth goes down this week because the market took a tumble, those numbers 1, two, 3 years, those are still positive. And I just look at those and I think I made that much in 3 years. Now, do you play other scenarios forward like and this is how much money I'm saving for being able to help my kids go to college or you know what are these other activities or um do you start to reverse engineer and at this rate I will be able to work for free. Yes.

[01:14:17] You know I'll be able to do whatever I want work-wise and not be dependent on a paycheck by age X. That's exactly right. I mean, I'm creating anticipation for future rewards, which is very intrinsic at this point. It's very intrinsic and it's actually surprisingly powerful. So, what was your do you remember the first exttrinsic thing you had to do?

[01:14:37] Was the spreadsheet exercise sufficient initially as the sole exttrinsic motivator? It's a really good question. I have to think back because it's been so long now. I think the spreadsheet was for me. Yeah, I think the I distinctly remember I I'm a spreadsheet junkie and I remember in medical school just as I'm getting ready to finish and start residency. It's my first real paycheck and I mean again I think we made $32,000 a year. So, it's not like you were rolling in money, but um I remember doing the math and being like, "Okay, you know, Hopkins is going to match my it was called a 403b, I think, because we were in I think a university is it's the same as a 401k."

[01:15:18] And I just remember thinking like, you know, I'd read all these books and it's like you were, it's free money, like you got to take it. But it became a game to me. So, I gified how little I could spend, right? So it was well I mean and I it's sort of embarrassing that I would be like look I technically don't need to spend money on food cuz I could just eat all the crap in the hospital for free. There's always a free meal in the hospital. I don't actually have to buy clothes cuz I could be in scrubs 24/7. And so I had this huge budget that I would line item and it I really had, you know, I had repayment of student loan, uh my truck loan, uh my rent, like it was relatively finite. And so discretionary money, most of it could go into savings and um and but but yes, I made that spreadsheet and

[01:16:05] I obsessed over it. So it's interesting to say that you were the same way. Oh, absolutely. I thought I was very unique in doing that. Well, what I love about what you just said is you said I gamified it, right? So the way games work is that it delivers rewards to us, right? That's why we play a game. It has a reward schedule. And the way that you gamified it is you came up with a spreadsheet because you can't play a game without a game board, right? You need some way of keeping track of whether you're winning or losing.

[01:16:30] You created for yourself a game board where you could gify savings. This is interesting. I never really thought of it that way. I assume people have already figured out a way to do this for young people. I'm sure there must be someone out there who has cracked the code on gamifying savings. If so, I have not found them. There's a lot of companies trying fact that you and I independently have done the same thing.

[01:16:49] But I think that there's a powerful aspect to that, which is I think the reason why it was so powerful for us is because we felt a sense of agency and choice over it. We came up with this model. We thought about what works for us. And and even though we were both using spreadsheets, I'll bet you our spreadsheets were pretty different.

[01:17:06] Sure. Like I think that we were measuring different things. We were investing in different things. We were looking, we were getting rewards from I know they were because your spreadsheet is more sophisticated because it's focusing on your returns. I was return agnostic. I was focusing on contribution. So my spreadsheet focused on the spend and what how big could I make the contribution number, right?

[01:17:28] But what went to Vanguard was like out of my hands. I was like they're going to do their thing and I'm going to pay attention. And and there's probably something about your psychology and my psychology where that contribution, that sense of of willpower and of sacrifice feels very very rewarding to you that it might feel less rewarding to me, but a sense of over time returns and it could have been age related to

[01:17:50] I'm sure it probably was cuz you're probably as returnsensitive as I am now, right? Yeah. Let's go back to the creation of other habits that are not immediately rewarding because unfortunately that again is in many ways the mainstay of health habits. Yeah. Um now some things that we we want people to do for health provide both short-term and long-term value and it's easier for people to anchor to the long-term value.

[01:18:17] So, easy example of that would be, um, you know, hey, uh, Sally, look, you're you're 30 lbs overweight and, um, I have to be honest with you, I don't particularly care that you're 30 pounds overweight from the standpoint of your weight, but you're also very insulin resistant as a result of it. And I know that if you can lose 30 pounds, it's actually going to improve your health.

[01:18:40] You're going to become more insulin sensitive. Your risk of diabetes, cancer, heart disease is going to go down. This is what I care about. And Sally might say, "Yeah, I mean, in the abstract, I agree with all of that, Peter, but look, I'm only 30 years old. Like, why? You know, what I really care about is being 30 pounds lighter, so I look great in a bathing suit."

[01:18:58] Right? And so, here you have a situation where both I can and the patient can care about the same outcome, but for different reasons. Yeah. And there's a great overlap, which is great. The way we're gonna address this is we're gonna make these changes in your diet, these changes in your exercise, and there's a win for both of us. Absolutely. Because in six months, you're gonna have the body that you want to have, and I'm going to have the numbers I want to have to feel confident that your risk of chronic disease is down, right?

[01:19:27] Okay. But for some things, there's it's very difficult to find the short-term win, and you have to grind away at doing something for a long period of time. Yeah. Now, I'll take a very simple example, which is taking medication. Mhm. It's not a huge ask, but you'd be amazed. If you're not familiar with this, you might already be familiar with the literature on compliance of medication use. It's shockingly low, shockingly.

[01:19:52] Uh so, let's take something that you don't even feel. So, the medicine truly has no bearing on how you feel, which is blood pressure medication. So even though the mainstay of therapy for blood pressure is weight loss and exercise, uh elimination of of sleep apnea and things like that, there's still a sizable portion of the population that has what's called essential hypertension.

[01:20:11] And no matter how much they fix their weight in the exercise, they just have hypertension. And if you don't fix it, you're really setting them up for the risk of heart attack, stroke, and even Alzheimer's disease. So I say, Charles, I really need you to take this medication, and I need you to take it twice a day. And by the way, I'd also like it if you could check your blood pressure three times a week at home so that I know it's working. And do I need to adjust it up or down? Now, for whatever reason, I might be able to get 50% of people to do that.

[01:20:40] So, I can't how can I create a reward around that? What type of reward would you envision? So, okay. So let's talk about what's been done because I think this is the key question and it's a really interesting one and I'm I I afterwards I want to ask you what you have done that you found has worked. Um so one of the interesting things that's happened in the last 5 years is that vitamin use has gone up significantly. More people are taking vitamins now than before. And researchers have looked at why and what they discovered was the big thing that changed vitamin use is making them gummies because you can put a little bit of sugar on the exterior of a gummy.

[01:21:18] Right? So what they're doing is they're creating an immediate reward for eating that vitamin. They're incentivizing the behavior. Let's take teeth brushing where there's a whole chapter in power of habit about the history of toothbrushing because if you went back a hundred years, a little bit over 100 years, turn of the turn of the the the last century, what you saw is that there were tons of toothpaste companies and almost nobody had a toothbrushing habit.

[01:21:43] And then this one guy comes up with a formula for how to get people to brush their teeth. What he does is he adds a little bit of mint to the toothpaste so it makes your gums tingle when you use it. Now, that's actually a pain response, right? That's not necessarily But what he's saying is when you brush your teeth, you're actually doing something good. You can feel it working.

[01:22:03] You can feel it on your gums doing its job. You're protecting your teeth. He's creating a positive reward even out of a pain response. So the number one thing we can do is we can try and manufacture a shortterm positive reinforcement, some type of positive reward that's going to incentivize that behavior. That's not possible with everything, right?

[01:22:24] So the next thing that we could do is we can work on people building a mental habit associated with that behavior that does deliver a reward. So savings is a great example. Taking my heart medication. So if I if I'm taking heart medication and it's kind of a pain, the pills dry. It's like taking it with fish oil. So it's like this. That's a great example. You get that like weird fish burp all day long.

[01:22:49] There's all these negative reinforcements, right? So what do I do in order to incentivize that behavior? Every time I take that pill, I think to myself, you know what? I'm going to be around for my grandkids. I'm creating a link inside my head by exploring the why that gives me a positive reinforcement.

[01:23:06] I feel a sense of responsibility. I'm a responsible person. I'm going to do that. That strikes me as an exceptional intrinsic reward in the long run. Would you lead with that? Absolutely. Is that strong enough as an exttrinsic out of the gate first 90day version? I it's going to take willpower and and like the thing about rewards is that we usually have to experiment with them because we're often very bad at anticipating how rewarding a reward is going to be.

[01:23:31] Yeah. Right. There's some people who say, "I'm going to go for a run and then I'm going to have a kale smoothie and they that's not realize how disgusting. It's disgusting. It's disgusting. Nobody wants That's why I put the peanut butter in." Yeah. So, we have to experiment with rewards to try and figure out which reward is salient for me and for me thinking about my kids thinking like I'm a responsible dad. I'm taking this pill. I'm doing it for my sons. I'm gonna be there for them. That is a very salient reward. For someone else, it might not be.

[01:23:58] I see. And they have to find that thing. And the way that we find it is we experiment with different rewards and we just see which one sticks. We're in this era of AI and AI chat bots and AI agents. You've already talked a lot about how social reinforcement is huge. I go back to the experiment you described in South America, 40% increasing savings by simply having that woman there to just tell you what a good job you were doing when you were savings.

[01:24:27] Yeah. Is there a belief has it been demonstrated that an AI agent can be as rewarding as a human being? So the research is so nent on this. Uh so my latest book is actually about the science of communication. And so this question of AI has come up a lot because and I also cover AI for the New Yorker now. This question of whether uh an AI system can be as good a conversationalist as another human.

[01:24:53] We don't really know, right? We're only two years into the generative AI experiment. What we do know is that I can create a reward for myself that's built around this ritualized behavior with an AI, right? So, so if I if I create that spreadsheet and I feel a sense of accomplishment from filling it out, I can get the same sense of accomplishment by getting into a ritualized behavior with AI. Hey AI, you told me that I should run two miles today and I ran two miles. We know that it's going to respond by saying good job. You're doing a great job, right? you're thinking about your your health for the long term now. Is the power there the AI system?

[01:25:34] Well, the AI system can automate it right. But the real question is, do I do I invest in the pride I feel from being told that by an AI? And for some people, the answer is yes. For other people, the answer is going to be no. So, the answer to your question is, yeah, AI is great because AI can help automate behav can automate certain rewards. It can automate certain behaviors, but whether that reward is salient to me, whether that behavior is salient to me really depends on me. And I have the power to choose.

[01:26:04] Yeah. I'm just trying to think that's really interesting because I know that I mean, I've already figured out ways to use AI as a reward for me and for my kids. Oh, for sure. Um, my boys and I love to just do Q&A sessions with chat GPT, like just, you know, go down the rabbit hole, right, of okay, what is the most valuable baseball card ever sold? Okay, it's this one.

[01:26:39] Why? What was the PSA on it? What? Okay, and and then what? But why was Mickey Mantels's worth less than Babe Ruth or whatever? Can I ask you a question about that? So all of those questions you could have just asked Google, right? Like in before before ChatGpt, you could have just done a Google search. What is it about doing it with chat GPT that feels more pleasurable to you?

[01:27:02] Great question. Now, of course, today you're absolutely correct in that Google today is mostly powered off Gemini. If you're using the right version of Google, you're actually getting Gemini to do the work. and it's using a great version of Gemini. Um I so so I'll give you the f my favorite thing I like to do with with chat GPT or with Grock or whichever one there all the agents are really good is I like to talk about I like to ask history questions because you know I was an engineer in college and I was one of those guys who even though I think in engineering school you had the option to take electives I didn't take any I just took more math.

[01:27:41] Interesting. Right. So, I kind of feel like I didn't learn anything. I mean, I learned my craft, but I didn't learn about history. Yeah. And furthermore, because I grew up in Canada, I really know nothing about US history. Oh, that's interesting. So, I didn't I don't even have the equivalent of high school history. So, my US history knowledge is not what I wish it was. And so, when I'm talking to an AI, it's like having a private tutor.

[01:28:05] Now, that's assuming that the hallucinations aren't so bad, right? But it's still it's really exciting to say like can we talk about this part of the civil war like what was it about Gettysburg that was the turning point and and then ask really complex questions like what would have happened if this had happened instead of that and how pivotal was this battle and um and so yes that for me is like a drug.

[01:28:30] Yeah. like h sitting down spending an hour talking with a chatbot about that type of a topic and also I think part of it is the talking. Yeah, it's the it's I can talk and I can listen. Yeah, that's absolutely right. And and so here's what I hear you saying and tell me if you think this is right. There's sort of two rewards that this is providing to you. The first is you have a very personalized search engine, right? It's it's answering the question you're asking instead of you having to like put a vague term in and try and figure out what what where the answers are. But number two, it's mimicking perhaps even authentically having a form of communication that we have been habituated to that we enjoy a lot.

[01:29:09] Right? When when when you and I are in conversation right now and and I'm sure you know this, our bodies and our brains are changing to match each other. Our heart rates are matching each other. Our breath patterns are matching each other. The neural activity in our brain and there's a guy named Yuri Hassan at

[01:29:22] Princeton who's done amazing research on this. Our brains are looking more and more similar. And because our brains have evolved to be good at communication, to be a pro-social species, we both feel a dopaminic response to that. We feel better. We feel good after a good conversation. Now, if you're having a conversation with AI, do you have that same matching?

[01:29:44] Maybe, maybe not. But we do know that I'm in the habit of feeling good when I have a good conversation. and that even if I'm having a good conversation with a chatbot, I'm going to get some of those glimmers of the same great feeling I get from talking to Peter and that's going to make that conversation easier for me and more natural and feel feel more fun.

[01:30:06] Yeah, I think there has to be something there. And I wonder if it is in how much it triggers the proximity to what is real. And I'll give you a silly example of why I think there's something to that. Um, with Chad GBT, you get to pick the voice you're talking to. Oh, that's interesting. Right. Right.

[01:30:22] And I've tried them all out, but there's I don't remember the name of the one I'm using, but it's a British guy. I don't know what it is about discussing history with a British guy, especially when you get into World War II history. Like, if you want to talk about World War II history with a with an older

[01:30:37] British man, it's awesome. Yeah. Like, it's it's just it's it's fantastic. And I don't think it would be nearly as enjoyable if I was talking about it with someone that didn't didn't didn't conjure up whatever image of of wisdom that I'm gleaning out of this. Some 16-year-old San Diego surfing chick. Exactly. Exactly. Totally different experience. Could be the exact same information, but there's an auditory component to it that is is lighting me up in a way that that and I think it's playing on old habits that you have, right? There's communication habits. I mean, my I I feel I I'm sure I was feel exactly the same way that like you listen to someone with a British accent and you just think they're smart, right? And by the way, I know lots of British journalists who like are not that smart, right? I know it's the old trope though, right? Like as Americans, we we think like it's metaphysically impossible to have a British accent and not be brilliant.

[01:31:26] Yes. Yes. And it works every time. And they use it to their advantage every time they come over to the United States. But I think what's happening there is it's taking advantage of these mental habits. You know, and we've talked a lot about behavioral habits today, but most of the habits that exist in our lives are mental habits.

[01:31:46] They're habits that we don't even recognize as habits because they're happening inside our brain. And they are incredibly powerful. They make you believe that a chatbot is more intelligent if it has a British accent than if it has a San Diego accent. Right. Yeah. These mental habits make me believe that when someone cuts me off in traffic, a perfectly appropriate response is to get angry, which does not benefit me, does not change the situation. I know that I should be zen about it, but it compels me to behave a certain way. So, let's say more about that. Let's say more about the the the mental habits. And I read something the other day which didn't surprise me one bit because anybody who has meditated will know this. Um we have an average of

[01:32:35] I believe 47 thoughts per minute. Wow. Yeah. That's right. You're almost one per second, right? And again, if you if you don't meditate or you haven't spent some time doing mindfulness meditation, you would think that's impossible. But if you've ever done the exercise of sitting there focusing on your breath, watching every single time you are distracted by a thought, you'll be like, "Yep, I can believe it's 47 times a minute." So that actually sounds small to me based on my meditation. So we we've got this uh crazy thing that is just a thought generating machine that we can't control.

[01:33:10] Yeah. Um but thoughts are not thinking. So what translates us from thoughts to thinking? How do we form better habits or reformat uh maladaptive habits around that? You give a great example, by the way, of the the reaction to getting cut off like an anger reaction. That's absolutely right. So, so the way that we can the way that we can influence our mental habits is that we have to deliberately choose to figure out what the cue is and then we have to give ourselves a reward afterwards. they they operate by the same principle as as behavioral habits or physical habits but it's a little bit more tricky right so oftentimes let's take um let's take innovation innovation is one of the a mental habit that's studied why do some people manage to innovate on demand much better than others right we can all be innovative but some people they need the muse to strike it takes them years and other people you walk in and you say hey look I need 30 great ideas by tonight and they can sit down and they knock them out So what's happening there? When researchers have looked at the lives of serial innovators, what they found is that the most important part of that is that often times the the people who are really good at it have built up what's known as a contemplative routine to spur that innovation. Now these contemplative routines can be something like every week I sit down and I reflect on all the good ideas I had last week just for 30 minutes and I try and think of good ideas for next for next week. Or the contemplative routine can be whenever anyone asks me to come up with 30 ideas the first thing I do is I go take a walk and I just think about it in my head. I'm not writing anything down.

[01:34:55] I'm not committing myself to anything. I'm just letting it percolate a little bit. I have a routine that I know works for me to spark contemplation. Because when you think about it, when it comes to mental routines and when it comes mental habits and when it comes to success, the most successful people throughout history are the people who can get themselves to think most deeply. Right?

[01:35:18] Making the right choice is so much more powerful than executing really well on the wrong choice. So the question is, particularly in a fast-paced world like today, how do we get ourselves to think more deeply? This is the killer app for our brain. And the way that we get ourselves to think more deeply is to build these contemplative routines that we automatically fall into because those contemplative routines push us to think more deeply. And I can give you an example of this if if you'd like of course which is um and again we describe this in um in or I describe this in smarter faster Better um there was a a plane

[01:35:58] Quantis flight 32 was a plane an Airbus A380 that took off from Singapore to Sydney um in the early 2000s and it it perfect takeoff. The captain was a great captain. About 10 minutes into the flight, um, one of the fan blades in one of the jet engines detaches and it punches this enormous hole in the wing.

[01:36:19] It also hits another fan blade and that fan blade explodes and it was like the shrapnel from a bomb going off inside the the the plane wing. So within about 12 seconds, there's 14 major systems that are needed to keep a plane aloft. Within about 12 seconds, 12 of those systems had gone offline. No hydraulics, no fuel, no measurements on anything. So the captain, a guy named Richard

[01:36:42] Drebney, he has to figure out how to land this plane safely. This is the worst mid-air mechanical disaster in modern aviation. So what does he do at that moment? What he does at that moment is there's all these alarms going off inside the cockpit. There's all these red flashing things on his on his board.

[01:37:00] The computer is telling him, "You have to do these 10 things, and as soon as you do those 10 things, you have to do five more things. you have to do 13 more things. What he does is he takes his hands off the controls for a second. He closes his eyes and he says to himself, I'm telling myself a story about the plane that I'm flying.

[01:37:19] And the story in my head is the Airbus A380. And it's really complicated because I have to think about fuel lines. I have to think about hydraulics. I have to think about brakes. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to change the story inside my head. I'm going to change the mental model that I'm using on where to focus and I'm going to pretend I'm flying a Cessna.

[01:37:38] Now, a Cessna is the plane that he learned to fly on. It's the plane he feels most comfortable in. And he actually sort of announces this to air traffic control and to his other pilots. And they freak out cuz they're like, "Why is this guy talking about flying a Cessna? He's in an Airbus A380." But that moment of contemplation allowed him to access that muscle memory, those habits of flying and he lands the plane safely. They touch down.

[01:38:04] All 469 passengers get off about half an hour later. There's not one injury on board. Now, they've tried to recreate this landing again and again in simulators. Almost every single time it crashes. So, what did Richard Drebney do differently? Why was he able to land that plane? And I've asked him. And what he'll tell you is he'll tell you he actually doesn't know or remember exactly what he did in the moment.

[01:38:27] But by changing that mental model in his head, by engaging in this contemplative routine, which felt supernatural to him to say, "I need to be in charge here. I need to stop reacting. I'm going to choose to pretend I'm flying a Cessna." That unlocked all of these learned habits of safe flying that allowed him to land that plane.

[01:38:47] Tell me more about him outside of the airplane. What kind of a man was he? What were his pastimes? What like this story is so impossible to imagine that I can't believe he's a normal guy. So he's not a normal guy. So he would he was trained to fly by the Australian um military, the Australian Air Force. And anyone who's learned to fly in the military, they know that a huge part of it is learning technical skills, but a huge part of it is also learning these mental habits, these mental skills. And in particular, learning how to train your focus based on building mental models. And the way that a mental model works is as we go through life, everything we do, there's a little story inside our head that we're telling ourselves. And our brain is comparing that story to what's actually happening to help us figure out what to pay attention to. There's so much that I could pay attention to right here, right? There's bright lights, there's your expressions, there's a camera, there's wood paneling. I need to figure out where to actually focus. And so what my brain does is it creates a mental model where it says the story of right now is that I'm having a conversation with Peter. So, I'm going to focus on Peter and I'm going to be very, very attuned if something changes unexpectedly in your demeanor and very unattuned if something changes outside to the light because it doesn't matter to me right now. So, when you're learning to fly in the military, they tell you be really deliberate about how not only you build mental models, but how you challenge your mental models.

[01:40:20] And so the morning before that flight, before Quantis flight 32 took off, Richard Drebney did this thing that he did before every single flight. He's in the shuttle from the hotel to the airport and he turns to his co-pilots and he says, because he's the captain, he says, "What's the first words out of your mind? Uh, what's the first words out of your mouth if we lose engine two? Where are your eyes going to go first? Where are they going to go second? What are you going to do with your hands? If we lose engine three, how are your words going to change? In other words, what he's doing is he's saying, "Tell me a story about how we will react if there is an emergency." And if you listen to the cockpit recordings from when that hole appeared in the wing, what you hear is you hear all these pilots talking to each other in calm, collected voices.

[01:41:09] There's not an ounce of panic in their voice. It's as if they had practiced this a thousand times because of course they had. They had practiced it in those rides from airports to or or in the simulator. But that's not the only thing that Dre did. The thing that made Dreany special is that when he would ask his co-pilots to tell him those stories, he would argue with them.

[01:41:30] Oh, that's what you're going to say first after Engine 2. Why are you going to say that? Like, why shouldn't we say this? What? You're going to move your hands left and then right? You're going to move your hands left and then right? Let's let's let's talk about like why not right and why not left. He was in the habit of challenging his own mental models and other people's mental models. And that challenge is what allowed him in the panic of that moment. Imagine you're flying a plane and all of a sudden all your alarms light up. It's so easy to become reactive. It's so easy to fall into just

[01:42:04] I'm going to do what the computer's telling me. I'm not going to think about this. I'm not going to challenge the story inside my head. But he's in the habit because he practices it with other people of challenging not only their stories but his story. What fraction of pilots are behaving that way from the particularly military trained a huge fraction. There is now there's a really interesting study particularly out of South Korea um that in some cultures there's too much difference given to the captain and so as a result they're engaging in less challenging of each other's mental models and there's been a lot of interventions to try and change that.

[01:42:42] The the tragedy on Canary Island if I recall there was a KM flight and it was the KM flight that was at fault. Everybody I think died on that flight. And it was a similar issue, wasn't there, where the captain, who was their, if I'm not mistaken, he was the most impressive captain in their entire fleet, right?

[01:43:03] Um but but I I think a simil a similar situation was not heeding the input from a less senior in the cockpit. That's exactly right. And and sometimes there's a there's an Air France flight, I don't know if you remember, it was from Brazil. Brazil. Yeah. Like so we have the cockpit recording of what happened there and if you listen to it there was nothing wrong with the plane the entire time it was that the pilots became what's known as tunnel focus right when

[01:43:29] I all I do is I pay attention to the most obvious inputs and I stop challenging that story in my head of what's going on so they actually cause the plane to stall and then it fell into the ocean. It happens all the time. So have you interviewed Sully Sullenberger? No. You know, so what's interesting is

[01:43:45] Rich I I spent a lot of time talking to Richard Drebney um and me and Sully share a speaking agent. They're both very similar. These guys are engineers engineers. Like you talk to Drebney and it's not like he's not a guy you go have a beer with. He is like a guy who like he is really difficult to talk to. Like first of all he believes there's a process for everything and there's a right answer and there's a wrong answer and and when

[01:44:11] I bring something up he'll be like nope you got that exactly wrong. let me tell you where you got it wrong. Right? This instinct to to challenge mental models is so ingrained in him that it comes out all the time. And they actually have this expression in in the um Australian air community and they might be in the US too that when someone's a really good pilot, they're known as an [ __ ] pilot.

[01:44:33] Mhm. Because they're so uptight, they're such an [ __ ] Like they challenge everything you say. They're always picking a fight with you about whether you're doing the right thing. That guy's an [ __ ] but he's a great pilot as a result. It means you don't want to have a beer with him, but you definitely want him flying your plane.

[01:44:49] Super interesting. What are some less dramatic examples of how this manifests in the lives of those of us who don't carry in a in our hands the lives of 400 passengers. So, let me ask you a question. So, what um what do you do to get ready for each week? Like, do you have like a process you go through or Yeah. So tell me about that. What is what is it that you that you do?

[01:45:13] Um every Friday afternoon I make a list of everything I'm going to accomplish on Saturday and Sunday. And every Sunday I make a list of everything I'm going to accomplish Monday through Friday. So I have two lists, a five-day week list and a two-day weekend list. Um and they include the most important things that have to be done. Now, not things that are automatic. So, I don't write my workouts and stuff because those are kind of on cruise control. Um, but it can be anything as mundane as got to go to Dick Sporting Goods and get uh, you know, a set of baseballs. You know, we're the old baseballs are getting beat up. Um, need to uh finish working on this newsletter. Need to prepare for this podcast. Um, need to, you know, take my daughter here. going, you know, it's it's it's just basically it's how I kind of organize the, you know, the blocks of the week.

[01:46:07] And why does that feel good to you? Cuz because you pro, you would end up taking your daughter anyways. You would probably see the baseballs and be like, "Oh, that's right. I got to go to Dicks." There's something about that list that's a contemplative routine for you. What What reward is it providing? Well,

[01:46:19] I am someone who it's weird, but I and this has always been the case even in school, like you know, high school. I really enjoy checklists and I enjoy checking things off a list and I So, there's actually a there there is a dopamine hit that I am getting. Absolutely. when I because I I have a box and I write what I'm going to do and then if it's in progress it gets a single line through the box and then when it's fully done it gets the X through the box.

[01:46:48] I love that. So for example, if one of the things was speak you know connect with uh Charles this weekend that's you know okay so let's say um I call you tomorrow and we talk for 5 minutes but then you have to run. I would put us half slash through it which is all right. We partially connected, but we haven't fully connected. So, I know that I still have to come back to it and connect with you.

[01:47:11] And if I don't, then it goes on the next list of the week or something like that. So, here's what I love about that. There's a need for cognitive closure that all of us feel, right? If you the research on people who make to-do lists find that 60% of people when they're writing a to-do list will write down something they have already completed because it feels so good to check it off.

[01:47:29] So, I used to do that. I stopped doing it about 20 years ago, but I did. I used to take great pride in sneaking in a couple wins out of the gate. Yeah. Because you have this. So what you've done is you've take that need for cognitive closure. It can push us to like do the laundry when we don't need to do the laundry, right? Because we just want to feel some sense of accomplishment. You have actually redirected it through a cognitive routine to be a very positive influence in your life. I'm going to create the goals that I actually want to accomplish. I'm going to create a system where I can satisfy that need for cognitive closure. and I'm gonna have a tracking device in order to do it.

[01:48:05] And that's okay. Sorry, continue. Well, I was going to say the reason why that's useful is because you have a routine around it. You have this cognitive routine that you're on Friday afternoons, you're doing the weekend list. On Sunday, you're doing the week ahead list. For me, my cognitive routine is every day when I come home from work,

[01:48:21] I tell my wife about my day in excruciating detail, and she is bored to death by it. She does not care how this interview went or what this what came out of this meeting. But I'm not doing it for her. I'm doing it for me. Because as I'm describing my day, I'm paying attention to this went well. Why did it go well? This didn't go as well. Like what? Like what do I need to do differently next time? I have a cognitive routine of describing my day to my wife that provides me with a dividend.

[01:48:50] Does she understand that? Oh, absolutely. She doesn't She tunes me out. She doesn't pay any attention. She She knows that I'm I'm describing the day for my benefit. and she does the same thing to me and I kind of tune out sometimes what she's saying about her day. Interesting. Yeah. You know, it's funny. I sometimes worry that I'm too rigid in having these lists and that especially the weekend list. Maybe would my life be better off without it and even though I would have to give up some productivity, um would it would I you know, would I would

[01:49:22] I be less wed because sometimes I get a little dogmatic. Yeah. Right. tight. We feel bad. I get up on Sunday and I'm like, "Dude, you're not you're not you didn't get much done yesterday. You've loaded the deck for today." Yeah. I think that's a really good instinct and I think it's worth experimenting with. Um, you know, one of the things that we know, so the way that

[01:49:40] I write articles for the New Yorker is historically, and I do this with books, too, is I I will write an outline that's almost as long as the article itself just to make sure I understand in bullet point. No, actually, in a narrative to my editor. Yeah. I write a letter to my editor. I do all the reporting and then

[01:49:57] I put it aside and I just write my editor a letter saying this is what I think I'm going to say. And it's easier because like the stakes are very low and I don't have to return to the reporting. If I get something wrong, it's okay. And that's worked really well for me particularly in writing, you know, books and writing long form pieces. But I do think it's impacted negatively my creativity. Like there's something about having having more op options and having that sense of risk that sometimes pushes you to figure out how to say something in a new way or pushes you to figure out how to say say something in a kind of fun way that didn't occur to you before.

[01:50:35] And so I play a lot with rigidity and and freedom in trying to find that right balance. And and my guess is that you do too in many of the things you do. I know that intellectually you do like I listen to the show and there's some questions that you ask that you ask everyone and there's some lines of inquiry you go down that are clear clearly like the right line of inquiry but then sometimes you ask a question that comes out of nowhere right or you ask something that's kind of unexpected that causes the guest to say something they didn't anticipate they were going to say I think intellectually you're engaging in that same exploration versus exploitation process that's at the core of all information gathering

[01:51:15] I want to go back to this contemplative sort of routine idea because the first thing that came to my mind when you described it is um going back to something that that um um that that Ryan Holidayiday wrote about the stillness is the key. Have you read that book? And I'm a huge fan of Ryan. I think he's great.

[01:51:34] And and obviously Ryan has written more books than than I can count. But I do that is my favorite. Right. That stillness is the key is is my favorite. It's the one I've gifted the most. Um, it it's um it's a book I go back to, you know, I'm actually due to reread it, right? I've only, you know, it's probably been two two years since I last read it, so I'm due to reread it. Um, and it's something that my brother does so well. You know, my brother, it's his superpower is making stillness time.

[01:52:06] Interesting. Um, he's very disciplined about this. He is very disciplined about time to think. Tell me how he does that. Like tell me a little bit more like what if I was watching him what would it look like? Well, you would actually think at the surface it's quite selfish, right? He'll he'll say for the next two hours I don't you know he'll tell his wife and his kids like I need to be left completely alone and I need to go for a walk with no phone, with no anything.

[01:52:36] Um and I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to walk in the fields. you know, he lives on a farm and he's like, "And I'm going to just be with my thoughts and with nothing else and then I can come back and do my best work." Yeah. Um, but he forces that in. Um, and I think I I am convinced that all of us could do better work if we did that. Um, and yet

[01:53:06] I struggle to do it. there there's a bit of a a trap that I fall into which is yeah but think about how much more I could get done in those two hours like I don't have the two hours to be still right so um Cal Newport has done a lot of work on this y and one of the things one of the mistakes that we make and this is just a a cognitive heruristic that we fall into is that we look at some types of activities as being unproductive because they don't have yield immediate dividends Right.

[01:53:38] This actually is part of the whole habit system. Absolutely. It absolutely is. It's about building those habits to recognize pro deep productivity, deep work. Right. Yep. And so one of the things that I'm sure it happens to me, I'm sure it happens to you, is that I say if I go take a walk in the woods for two hours, like what do

[01:53:55] I have to show for it, right? There's like whereas if I sit down and I pound through these emails for two hours, suddenly I like my inbox is half the size it used to be. It feels really like an accomplishment. Now, of course, all that does is create more emails for me. And it turns out half of those I could have ignored. But so what I need to do is I need to train my brain. And my brain often times doesn't believe me, right? I know intellectually taking that walk in the woods will is going to yield dividends that I'm going to be able to do better work. But my brain, there's a part of my brain that looks at my stated preferences, what I believe and want to be true, and another part of my brain that looks at revealed preferences. How do I actually behave? And that revealed part of my brain is saying you never take walks. Like you always sit down and do your email. You must think that doing email is more valuable than taking a walk. So I have to convince myself convince that revealed preference is part of my brain. No, the walk is really good. Like if I if I take this walk, I'm going to I'm going to get more work done. I'm going to be able to get through those emails faster because I'm going to hit delete on more of them.

[01:54:59] This actually is a productivity enhancer. We don't we have to hack our own brains. Sometimes we have to remind oursel of a reward. Oftentimes the salience of a reward increases simply because we tell ourselves it is a reward and we have to take advantage of that to try and sometimes play with our own brain because we'll act in our sometimes in not our best interests. And so what do you think is the relationship then between productivity and habit? How implicit and how explicit is it?

[01:55:35] So, I think it's huge. I think it's huge. But, but let me be very clear how I mean that because oftentimes the things that we do out of habit are not the productive things, but our habits can set us up to be productive. As I mentioned before, the the most important element of productivity is deep thought, right? Because making the right choice, making the right decision, spending my time on the right task right now yields many more dividends than simply getting something done. It's the difference between productivity and busyiness. So the question is, how do I set myself up to make better choices? Well, the way that I do that is I build habits that give me not only the time and space to make a choice, but the prompt to make a choice. Because there's a lot of times that I'm going to avoid making a choice if I can. My brain doesn't like making choices. It's energy. It costs energy.

[01:56:28] It feels like it's depleting me. So, my brain is going to say, "Oh, you walked in the cafeteria. Like, don't get the salad. Just get the sandwich you get every single time. You know, it's going to you're going to like it." Right? So, how do I build a habit that allows me the space to make that choice and the prompt to make that choice? That's why habits are so important is not because they make us productive, it's because they allow us to be productive. say more about the decision fatigue because I think that's something that many people listening to us right now can relate to. Um I have become much more aware of it in myself recently and

[01:57:04] I don't think it's age related per se. I think it's just complexity related. So the more things you're juggling the more I find myself unable to make simple decisions. And it's like I can't tell you how internally frustrated I get sometimes when I'm asked to make decisions. So there's two things happening there. And you're exactly right that decision fatigue is real, right? We've seen it in done actually at this point hundreds of studies that the more decisions you have to make in a day, the more fatigued you get. But there's some there's some elements that play into this. The first is structuring decision design. So,

[01:57:42] President Obama, in one interview, he said that the most important habit that he developed when he was president is he bought 12 of the same suits and shirts. So, every morning when he woke up, he just he knew exactly what he's going to put on. It's the same. There's no other options in his closet. He just has to grab one of them.

[01:58:00] Yep. And he said the reason why is because the day was so exhausting with decisions and each of the decisions he made was so important that he had to preserve his ability to make decisions. So, and avoid that fatigue. So, the first thing is how do we design our decisions so that we're only having to make the important ones and we're making the the less important ones automatic things where we don't have to make a choice. Right? The second thing that happens there is that decisions are harder to make in a hot state than they are in a cold state.

[01:58:33] So, if you're hungry and you go into the cafeteria, it's going to be a lot harder for you to choose that really healthy salad over that really tasty sandwich because you're in a hot state. Yep. Now, in a cold state that morning when you just had breakfast, if you say, "My implementation intention is I'm going to eat a salad today. When I walk in, that's I'm I know which salad I'm going to get." It's a lot easier to make that decision. So, here's what I think is happening. Number one, you don't have a mental heristic in place to say, "I'm going to I'm going to curate the decisions I have to make." Because if you had that, and you probably do now, but like the first time it comes up, you don't have the heristic. And the heristic is when my wife asks me where to go to dinner, I'm just going to choose one of them. I'm not even going to like think about like which one is the best one. I'm just going to choose one, right? So, I'm going to create a designru a decision structure for myself that allows me to focus on the most important decisions and ignore the the smaller ones.

[01:59:28] Secondly, she I'm going to ask her not to ask me to make that decision at the end of the day when I'm exhausted and I've been making choices all day long. Yeah. I'm going to say, "Look, I'm in a hot state right now. I can't think about where to go to dinner, I'm thinking about other stuff. But if you ask me two hours from now after I've had a beer and I've started watching TV, I think I'll be ready to answer that question."

[01:59:51] And you're so right that that's the obvious answer. And yet you feel or at least I feel like how can I not be more gracious. Oh, right. Like I feel embarrassed that I would have to say that and obnoxious. Absolutely. But it's true of everybody in my life. Like sometimes my assistant will email me and say, "Can you pick lunch?" Like we're having an offsite and can you pick your lunch? And I'm like, "I can't."

[02:00:16] Like I literally and it sounds silly, but like if it comes through on text, it's even more debilitating. Yeah. Because then I have to click the menu and see the menu and it's like a restaurant. I don't and I'm like I wish you could read my mind and you knew what I wanted. I don't want to have to do this.

[02:00:31] It's very Canadian of you that you feel a sense of guilt around around try to telling someone you can't make the choice right now. So So I think it part of our brains particularly for successful people, right? Everyone listening to this podcast, you and I, when we are successful, our self- definitionf rooted in success instead of failure. We are the type of people who have been successful because we make good decisions. And so we beat up on ourselves when we when we can't make a decision. We beat up on ourselves when we have a human frailty or a human weakness. But you know this from from training athletes. The key is not to not have frailnesses. The key is to recognize your frailnesses, plan for them, and strengthen your behavior around the frailness.

[02:01:19] Every single one of us makes bad decisions. And if our self-defin is I'm someone who like every time everyone asks me a question, I give them the right answer, then we're setting ourselves up for failure. It's been 12 years since you wrote what is um you know I think arguably the um the most authoritative text on on habit creation. How much have you stayed um up to date on the science of habit? And and and if so, how much has changed in the last 12 years? If you were to rewrite that book today, what are two or three things that you think might be different or that we're just outright missing? So

[02:02:01] I' I've tried to keep very current on the literature around it and and the fundamentals haven't changed, right? The fundamentals have been true for thousands of years about a cue, a routine, and a reward, how our brain works and forms habits. What has changed is our understanding of how much influence we can have over those cues and rewards by influencing our environment. So I'll mention another author, uh, David Epstein, who was wonderful. He's a wonderful had him on a podcast six, seven years ago.

[02:02:28] Yeah. He's great. He's great. and and he talks a lot about current research looking at environments where we have a lack of resources and environments where we have a lot of resources. And environments where we have a lack of resources often times produce better outcomes. But not all resources are created equal. Right?

[02:02:49] If I tell you you have a time limit on coming up with a new idea and your time limit is 5 minutes, that's not going to be helpful. But if I tell you, Peter, you can't spend more than two days on this, that is helpful. So, what we're learning a lot about is how to use constraints, how to create what are known as um wicked environments where the feedback is ambiguous, is long, it takes a long time to arrive and it's not being delivered in a social context versus helpful contexts or or good contexts where the feedback is immediate. It's very very clear and it's being delivered to me oftentimes in a social context which reinforces it.

[02:03:32] We're learning a lot about how these different environments influence our ability to act in different ways. And you know this is at the core of behavioral economics. We we've known for a long time that the decision architecture matters that environment matters. But what we're learning is we can get much more precise. So, if I was writing the power of habit today, one of the things that I would include is a chapter on thinking much more deliberately about your environment. Not just I'm going to put apples on my desk so that when I have a craving to eat something, I eat one of those apples instead of a donut in the break room, but also I'm going to structure my day so that I make my most important decisions in the morning because I know that that's when my my decision-m is strongest. I'm going to structure my day so that I go and I take a walk in the afternoon because I know that if I do that, I'm going to do better work that evening.

[02:04:26] I think that one of the things that we are learning is our environments matter much more than we thought they did and it's worth paying attention to that. Do we have a greater sense of appreciation for the social component today than we did then? I I obviously it was strong and well understood then but it almost seems to me that and I don't know if it's just coincident with social media but we just understand the power of social influence and that's actually one of the reasons I wrote super communicators is because what I came to realize is that when we focus on habits we tend to focus on ourselves but most of our most important work both for ourselves and professionally is work that we do in conjunction with others. the the value of my life and your life is largely based on the conversations we have with our spouses and our kids, right? That's whether we feel good or bad. And so what I realized is by focusing on habits exclusively, I'm missing this incredibly important part of what makes people successful and happy, which is how do we interact with other people? And we are making we are living in a golden age of understanding communication like never before. Because of advances in neural imaging and data collection, we can see inside people's brains as they're having a conversation.

[02:05:38] We know what's happening there. And we're learning a tremendous amount about what kinds of social reinforcement are positive and which kinds aren't and which kinds are powerful, more powerful than other kinds. So, I'm not going to ask you if you're working on another book because I know you might not want to talk about it, but you're you're you're always in a state of learning. Is there is there something that that is that is brewing as the next evolution in your in your thinking?

[02:06:05] So um and in fact I'll tell you what the next book I want to write and invite and invite listeners to reach out to me if you think there's something I should know about. So I think AI is really really interesting and really really important. Now I'm not one of those guys and I interview a lot of these guys who says

[02:06:20] AI is going to change every single part of life. It's going to revolutionize everything. I think there's a lot of humanness that's really important to us. But I do think that AI has the same potential that the indust the first industrial revolution and the second industrial revolution had that the the wide adoption of the internet had. And what's interesting to me is if you look at the history of non-fiction literature, what you see is that there were these moments of real discovery and someone wrote a book that explained to us how to think about it. One of my favorite examples is The Right Stuff.

[02:06:55] Many people have seen the movie, right? The book is fantastic. It's written by Tom Wolf. It's an amazing book. And what he's really writing about is he's not writing about the science of the Apollo missions. He's writing about the psychology of the people who are designing those rockets and are getting on those rockets. His basic question is, what kind of a person is willing to strap themselves to a rocket before we knew that this was safe and easy and send themselves into space before we knew we could survive there? Why? Why is someone willing to do that? Why are people competing for the opportunity to do that? And he found a lot of interesting answers. That's what I'm wondering right now about AI. And we might be a little bit too early in the process to really have any conventional wisdom or takeaways.

[02:07:41] Why h why do some people see the world differently in a way that allows them to develop these generative AI systems and other AI systems that are so potentially transformative? And most importantly, how will it change how the rest of us think? How will it change our our definition of self? How will it change how we work? Those are really interesting questions. So that's that's what I'm hoping to write about in the next book. And I think there's probably going to be a lot of lessons in it about how we ought to behave.

[02:08:12] What do you think about the importance of purpose to a to to our species? I think it's incredibly important. I mean, and and here we get like a little mystical, right? Because we don't know why purpose seems to light up so many parts of our brain, but we know that it does. We need we need a why, right? That story that's inside our head, that mental model that tells us what to pay attention to and what to do next.

[02:08:46] We are a storytelling species. We look for correlative links in life. I, you know, I I told this one funny joke and so the girl fell in love with me. I I started running every single day and then, you know, I got in better shape and I was able to give up smoking. That might be correlation and not causation, right? But we look for those causal links. We look, we want them to exist. We make sense of the world by telling ourselves a story about the world. And it at the core of most stories is the why. Why is the knight getting on his horse and going to fight the dragon? There's got to be some reason for it. There's got to be some motivation. He wants to win the hand of the princess, right? Why do you remain faithful to your spouse?

[02:09:36] There's temptations all around, right? Our biology tells us that we should probably not be faithful, but there's a why there. That's at the core of our story. And the reason why that story is so important is because it's our self-identity. It is how we make sense of oursel as an individual in this world. And if we had to reinvent our self-identity every morning, it would be exhausting. That's actually what schizophrenia is.

[02:10:02] One of the contemporary ways of looking at schizophrenia is that it's someone who has biochemically a more difficult time telling themselves a consistent story from day to day. And it's awful. And so the purpose, that why is so important because it grounds us in our story and that tells us who we are. So many of the stories then about AI's power and potential is that many of us will not be necessary from a at least a work perspective, right? And so let's just assert that there's some truth to this, right? That that people, you know, and again, I I would put myself and my career near the top of the list of things that could be outdone.

[02:10:54] Yeah. Um so what what do we make of a of a of a world in which many people no longer have a professional why? Is it something that could be substituted with a personal why? In other words, is there a world in which I'm no longer necessary in any way, shape, or form for any of the things I do? I don't need, you know,

[02:11:17] AI will do a better job at podcasting. AI will do a better job at doctoring. AI will do a better job at everything I do. Um, my kids will be too old to need me as a parent. Um, but I'll I'll become so obsessed with chess that that will become my why. Is that is does that work? So, what I would what I would suggest is two things. We've always had this concern, right? There's always been this concern that each technological leap forward will mean that work disappears and it's never come true. It just means that work changes, right?

[02:11:48] The second thing I would argue is you're already there. I mean, look, at this point, you don't need to work for the paycheck. No, that's my point. Yeah. You've got enough money, but I still choose to. I mean, you choose to work, right? And you're not working necessarily. You call it work, but it's also stuff that you would probably do in your spare time, even if it was uncompensated, even if you thought of it as fun. I enjoy this.

[02:12:10] You don't take ads for this podcast, right? You have made a decision. This is a this is a hobby for you. Very impactful, very successful hobby, but it's not work, but you define it as work. You feel a sense of obligation to it because it fulfills a purpose for you. I am not worried about AI spreading and us losing our ability to create purpose. I think that what we find purpose is that a contrarian view or do you think most people would share that view?

[02:12:38] I and and I asked that not knowing the answer. I think if you were in Silicon Valley, um, it would be a contrarian view, but I will say a lot of the people who work on AI, they are not very close to normal life, right? They they are not they're not they're not living the lives that you and I live. And so I think they're they're possibly rightfully worried about issues that you and I don't worry about quite as much.

[02:13:04] I would say among the broader population particularly among scholars my view is more in the mainstream that there's a recognition that these this hand ringing over losing the need for work has always existed with us you know elevator operators like basically elevators have been taken over by AI right really dumb AI but like it's an AI it used to be that every elevator you got you got on there had to be someone there who stopped it at the right floor there are not people walking around right now who say like, "Ah man, if I could only be an elevator operator, my life would be so much better."

[02:13:38] Because they found something else to do. They found something that was equally meaningful to them. Our human ability to find purpose and manufacture purpose and create purpose is infinite. And as we move into a new world with different technological challenges and different technological opportunities, we will find that purpose. Cuz the truth of the matter is maybe someday AI can raise your kids.

[02:14:04] Maybe your kids get old enough and they don't call you anymore and say, "Hey dad, I need your advice on this, but you're they still need you as a dad. They're still going to mourn you when you pass away." There is something elemental and human about being human and that can't be taken from us. Do you think AI needs to internalize the value of human life for us to be able to coexist with it? Or is there an actual risk, an existential risk to our species if AI doesn't understand our uniqueness?

[02:14:45] I have no idea. I mean, there's there's certainly some people who are smarter than me who could who feel like they can answer that question more authoritatively and say yes or no. It's a huge risk to us. It's going to kill all of humanity. There's other people who say actually AI is such an alien when it eventually does reach this point AGI or super intelligence or the you know the moment where Skynet becomes real that it's such an alien form of thinking and form of cognition and form of sent sentience that it won't really care about us the same way we don't really care about ants right so there's people on both sides of this the answer is I have no idea I actually don't even know I don't know what AI AI actually is right. Defining AGI, artificial general intelligence, is really, really hard. Second of all, I don't know how AI is going to be exploited. I mean, right now we use it to have fun conversations about history with our kids, right? But if you think back to the internet, when the internet first started, nobody thought that the really important financially productive and impactful way to use it would be to sell everything through one store and to allow people to basically shout at each other on social media, right? It wasn't the technology that gave rise to those either advances or or weaknesses. It was people like

[02:16:10] Jeff Bezos seeing the world in a new way that the technology empowered. We're not at the stage yet where people are seeing the world in a new way because of the AI, but they're going to and they're going to use it in ways that surprise us that we can't anticipate. And until they start doing that, I don't know that I can answer your question.

[02:16:27] Yeah. Which I think brings me back to one of the most exciting things that I would love to see AI have a huge impact on is one of the things that we as humans have the biggest challenge with with which is behavior changing help encouraging and helping people to change behaviors which kind of brings it all full circle right which is if if there is an AI agent that can be the most powerful tool for behavior change as powerful as having you stand next to a person 24/7 as their behavior coach then you really change lives.

[02:17:09] And do you think that that's we're going to see that? Like is that is that is that a is that an achievable outcome? Honestly, I think Charles, you're in a better position to answer that because I think you have a far better uh and a deeper knowledge of the science because the real question is do we know how to do we have the data for how to do this under perfect perfect circumstances that can serve as training data through this vehicle? Because you know if you take a step back and ask is the

[02:17:41] LLM platform the right platform I think the answer is yes for this application. We can debate whether the LLM is the right platform for all applications of AI. It may or may not be. Um but given the transformer in 2017 that was the I mean that took us down this path but I have to believe it's the right platform for this problem. So now the question becomes do we have enough training data? Do we do we know do we know what the solution space looks like?

[02:18:06] Do we have the data to train it? And if so, then it comes down to how important is an actual human in this element versus the words. Yeah. So, I'm going to add one more element to the the formula that you just described. The solution space assumes that delivering the knowledge is the bottleneck, right? I need something to deliver me the right knowledge at the right moment very very easily.

[02:18:33] Not necessarily. It could be that. Well, it depends how you define knowledge, right? It could I I I I was thinking about this more broadly, which is if you were stand let's say I'm I need help changing my habits. You standing next to me, you will provide me with knowledge. You'll provide me with accountability. You'll provide me with reassurance.

[02:18:53] So here here's the thing that I'm going to suggest is that there's a step before that which is are you actually motivated to change? I mean, because the truth of the matter is if you say like, "Yeah, sure, I'd love to lose 10 pounds, but it doesn't really matter that much to me." It doesn't matter how much I stand next to you, how much positive reinforcement

[02:19:11] I give you. If you're not, if you don't have fundamental motivation to make that change, it's probably not going to happen or at least not in a profound and lasting way. And so now the question becomes, AI can certainly deliver the information to me. It can certainly deliver the positive reinforcement. I can certainly deliver all the the subsequent parts of the formula.

[02:19:30] Can AI generate motivation in me to change? What fraction of people who fail to make change fail because that is missing or because all of the coaching, queuing, behavior modification that follows is missing. So let me ask you, how many copies of your book have you sold at this point? Outlive um almost 3 million. 3 million? That's a lot. Okay. is 3 million people who have gotten fantastic information.

[02:19:58] Well, maybe some didn't read it. Maybe some didn't read it. As as long as they bought the book, how many of those 3 million do you think made the change that they wanted to make after reading the book? You know, I'd like to believe that many people have made a change. Yeah. But probably very few have made every change.

[02:20:18] Well, and and what I would suggest is that the people who are picking up that book, they're motivated to begin with, right? Right. That's a selection bias out of the gate. Yeah. So, here's what I would say. I would say I think this motivation question is the most important one. I I think that you can

[02:20:36] It's the inception question. It's the inception question. It's because if you don't It's a It's a necessary prerequisite. It's not sufficient on its own, but it's a necessary prerequisite. And there's a lot of people who pick up your book, and I'm going to include myself in this, who say, "I really want to do everything

[02:20:48] Peter tells me. Like, I I want to be super healthy. I want to work out every day. I want to live forever. And I read the book and I say, I'm going to do this. But, you know, I have motivation for 15% of it or 20% of it or 50% of it, but then on the other 50% I don't have the motivation yet. And the question is, how do I generate that motivation? It's not your job to generate the motivation for me. It's you can you can give me the arguments. you can tell me why this is important and you're persuasive and maybe that will motivate me, but ultimately you're delivering me the information I need once I'm motivated.

[02:21:25] And so that motivation part is a real is a real question. Now let's look at someone like Tony Robbins. What does Tony Robbins deliver? He delivers the motivation. Right? If you listen to what Tony Robbins says about financial stuff, and I think I think the world of Tony Robbins, I think he's had a huge impact on people's lives. I don't think his advice is the most sophisticated advice on the face of the planet. I think his ability to motivate people is incredibly sophisticated and as a result, he's changed a lot of lives.

[02:21:56] What do you think? Does that make sense? Yeah. So, what do you think is the element of that? And does it work uniformly or is there a susceptibility? Is there a subset of people for whom that that that style of motivation works? I think well so we know that there is there are people for whom that style of motivation works and other people for whom it doesn't right just and it and it might just be taste it might just be habituation like there's a really funny meme of him at a I don't know at one of his you know whatever they do things and it's he's getting this guy to roar like a lion like it's the funniest thing I've ever seen but it's just it's just like like it's again there's a subset of people for whom at that roaring like a lion is going to change his life. And then there's a subset of people that look at that and think, "Yeah, that's not for a million dollars.

[02:22:52] That doesn't change anything. That doesn't that's not going to change anything, right? It's actually going to make it I'm going to be demotivated because this seems so silly." That being said, anyone who's listening, you should go to a Tony Robbins thing, even if you don't believe it or enjoy it. It's just the spectacle of it is amazing. What he does on a stage is is really astounding. Um, so I think what you're asking is like what do we know about the science of like do we know that there are there are some people for whom um the way he delivers a message is the is the turnkey to make this happen and and um again I I'm I'm if I if I sit there and listen to him give a talk it's it's it makes a ton of sense. It's very inspiring. It seems like yeah that that all makes sense. Um, but it's to me I always think of that as the easier problem to solve. I think the harder problem is the one that you're trying to solve, which is okay. Yeah. Like Tony might get you to realize you need to quit smoking, but quitting smoking is hard.

[02:23:51] How do I how do I come up with a plan for that? How do I how do I actually both necessary and neither is sufficient? I think that's right. I think that's right. and and to one of the things that we do know about motivation is much like rewards, it tends to be very different from person to person. And so the only way to really figure out what motivates you is to experiment, right? I mean, my guess is if I was to ask you what Oh, let me ask you. So, what motivates you to work out every day?

[02:24:19] It's many things. it there's there's the there's the cognitive piece of it which is I really really believe what I preach daily which is exercise as a tool is the single most important tool in both magnitude and direction at lengthening life and improving quality of life. So in as much as I want to live longer and live better, exercise is is as important if not more important than anything I could do. Let me ask you, those motivations that are getting you to work out every day, are those the same motivations that would have worked on you when you were 20 years old?

[02:24:55] No, not at all. Right. Wasn't even on my mind when I was 20. Right. And as a result, what we need as a motivation changes over time. It changes from situation to situation. The the the environment, the choices we make. So it's it's not like we can say like this one form of motivation is the right form of motivation. What we can say is motivation is really important.

[02:25:16] We know that motivation has certain characteristics, but we also know that it is something that is incredibly adaptive in people's lives and that they find motivation from different sources throughout the course of their life. Yeah, that's a really good point is that what what worked, you know, what got you here yesterday isn't going to get you there tomorrow necessarily.

[02:25:33] Yeah. Um and it might be when you're 70 years old, you're I just turned 50. You're 52. Is that right? 52. 52. So we're we're in the same place, right? where we can for the first time that road is really realistic and because you've written so eloquently about it I'm sure you've thought about it a lot.

[02:25:50] No, no, I'm long past that. I mean, I might have 30 years left on Earth if it's real. It's real. That also has an impact. And what motivates you 20 years from now might be different from what motivates you today. But what's important is if you're paying attention and nurturing that motivation, if you're conducting experiments to see what does motivate you and what doesn't motivate you, it's when we stop thinking about it that we start making that we get into trouble.

[02:26:13] Charles, this has been super interesting and I know it's kind of funny that you're, you know, um, you know, I read Super Communicators last summer, uh, last spring actually when it came out. Um and uh but but really what I wanted to talk about today was a you know a book you wrote 12 years ago um which I think is uh so I would recommend everybody read everything you've written but but this is uh in some ways I think uh this is the book that that I think can have a greater impact on people's lives. It's um it's an exceptional book and I hope that we've we've spurred people to kind of go back and and try to apply it because in many ways what you've written about is the book end of what I'm trying to write about. I'm trying to write about the what you need to do. But but at the end of the day, if you can't create habits around these things, it is difficult.

[02:27:02] Well, thank you for having me on and thank you for those kind words. I I'm such a huge fan of you and of the show and it's just an incredible honor to be here. So, thanks. Well, thank you for coming out and um I'll have to think of a good smoothie place in Austin to send you. I want to reward you for sitting through this.

[02:27:19] As long as they've got peanut butter, then I'm good. Thank you, Charles. Thank you. [Music]

**Channel:** Peter Attia MD
**Upload Date:** 2025-08-25
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4j_bet1Z4A
**Duration:** 142 minutes

## Description

Josh Spitalnick is a clinical & research psychologist with expertise in treating a variety of anxiety conditions with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) & other evidence-based approaches. In this episode, Josh unpacks the four layers of anxiety—psychological, emotional, cognitive, & behavioral—highlighting why avoidance is the key feature that transforms ordinary worry into disorder. He explains why he continues to treat OCD & PTSD as anxiety conditions despite their DSM-5 reclassification, & he draws important distinctions between worries versus worrying & thoughts versus thinking. The discussion explores health anxiety, illness anxiety, & the impact of modern contributors such as wearables, social media, & the COVID era, while weaving in real-world case studies & Josh’s structured assessment approach. Josh also breaks down evidence-based treatments, from exposure therapy & cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to acceptance & commitment therapy (ACT), along with the role of medication, lifestyle factors, & how shifting from avoidance to committed action can build long-term resilience.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I want to get a sense of where you think the balance lies between the abundance of information we have today about health and the triggering of more health anxiety. Health anxiety has skyrocketed in the last 4 years. Is that signal getting louder? Yes. And by the way, going on WebMD or Google or because a social media influencer said, "If you have this, this is probably what it is." does not diagnose you. I'd like to use worry versus worrying to help people understand when they've crossed that threshold. For the anxiety sufferer, worrying looks like they're trying to solve something. The problem is is when they get their answer, they're not done.

[00:00:38] What about the individual who they create a story that says this is cancer or this is heart disease or this is whatever. Everything they get checked up for is fine. Someone will prescribe you something thinking that they have the magical cure to fix your distress, your pain. And my job is to sit with them and say the pain is real, the sensation is real, the symptom is real, but it may not really be indicative of the thing that you think it could be. Now, let's talk about what your ongoing exposure therapy is to get him to be feeling like his old self. Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter

[00:01:11] Aia. [Music] Josh, thank you for making the trip out to Austin. I would imagine the temperature is not that different from where you're from in Atlanta. Not much. Uh I left some humidity for pretty rigorous heat, so thank you for that. We trade humidity for heat here. I'll take heat over humidity. I will.

[00:01:33] Um so we're going to talk about anxiety broadly um and probably get into a specific subset of anxiety which is around health anxiety. Something that people like me are probably contributing to in some form or another. We're going to talk about that. I wondered if you were going to bring that up. you started there. Great, great start.

[00:01:50] Yeah. So, so not something I want to be doing, but I think uh inevitably it becomes a two-edged uh sword as you probe deeper into health. You you end up doing this. Um but before we get into that, I do think this term anxiety is so broad that that I want to kind of maybe just start with your background. Uh what is it that you do in your practice? Who do you work with? Uh maybe help folks understand a little bit why why I'm sitting down with you. Sure. So, I'm a licensed psychologist. I'm boardcertified in behavioral and cognitive psychology, which means in addition to everything I do, I spend a significant amount of time focusing on how people think, how people act, and how we can address those in in their deficits, and how we can improve them to make their lives better. Very basic. So,

[00:02:36] I'm a therapist. At the end of the day, I'm a therapist. Um, and though my career has had many stages, I've spent most of the last 15 years of my career doing almost nothing but focusing on anxiety kinds of conditions. For me, anxiety is many layers as it is for most people. It's a very physical experience, very physical, physiological. It's an emotional experience. There are cognitive elements to it. How we think and ultimately the way we judge each other and how we see each other is the behavioral experience.

[00:03:05] So, we see what people do and don't do. And so an anxiety specialist um is someone who really addresses all of those domains of functioning. How we physically, emotionally, cognitively, and behaviorally act in our own world and in relation to others. Let's start, you know, talk about the definition of anxiety. I think everybody kind of loosely understands what it is and I'm sure most people have at some point experienced it. Um, but is there um a

[00:03:31] DSM5 criteria that you refer to or do you think about something that goes uh deeper and or broader than than what the the DSM would have to say about anxiety? So, the DSM5 actually altered anxiety disorders. Um, we're going to be seeing the DSM6 probably in a few years. I'll be interested to see what it does. But in the last iteration of the DSM, it actually pulled two pretty prominent anxiety disorders out of the anxiety disorders. It moved PTSD out of the anxiety disorders and it moved OCD out to the anxiety disorders. I don't believe for one second that they're not anxiety disorders. They're anxiety disorders, but because of some special elements about them, some people much wiser than me and you decided that they should be in their own special categories. And those two disorders specifically have some interesting elements to them that I see why you'd want to separate them out. For me, when

[00:04:20] I think about interventions, and this is maybe a reverse order for how physicians are trained or how even some therapists are trained, for me, the intervention sometimes dictates the disorder. And that may not be the most popular thing to say, but most the interventions we're going to probably talk about today are going to be some version of cognitive behavioral therapy and some version of exposure-based therapy. Those are two of the leading interventions. Um, gold standard, some people use the phrase, or firstline treatments of choice for almost any anxiety disorder. um of the 8 to nine that I like to refer to. So anxiety is a loose category. Anxiety for me simply means that someone is emotionally, physically, cognitively, behaviorally, internally preoccupied with something that's concerning them and then undeniably they're doing something about it. Often doing the wrong thing. And so as an anxiety specialist and as someone who runs a large practice and we get thousands of referrals a year, Peter, I'm always tickled that our practice thrives because amongst all the anxiety disorders, they share one common symptom. They all have different symptoms. They all have different criteria. We can talk about some of them. Um but they all share one symptom, avoidance. And so for me, avoidance is the kind of the thread between all of them that identifies when we have someone who has worries, physiological anxiety, cognitive anxiety, behavioral anxiety. When I start seeing avoidance, we're now going from someone that has a worry state to something that's probably more problematic. And so there's many versions of avoidance, but avoidance is a is a is a behavioral coping tool that's highly effective in the moment for the anxiety but ineffective long-term for functioning that is shared amongst almost all the anxiety disorders. So anxiety is a loose category and it's how people are thinking mostly about the future, how they're feeling about the future, how they're anticipating the future. So we start talking about anticipatory anxiety. We start talking about these risk calculations. We start talking about worrying about something that's going to happen, catastrophizing, plotting and planning and then acting in advance of that which you've built an amazing career around in medicine to plan 30, 40 years in advance. But the anxious person is using that in a way they're weaponizing that sort of fortunetelling in a very unhealthy way and it's ruining their lives. So if avoidance which you're describing as an action um is the the sinquanon of all forms of anxiety is the correlary of that that worry or distressed thought about the future absent a behavioral avoidance doesn't cross the threshold of anxiety and therefore is not necessarily I don't want to use the word but pathologic.

[00:06:56] Sure. So the DSM at its core is about dysfunction in every category of disorder in the DSM from kidney disorders to schizophrenia to to medically induced disorders uh you know med cancer induced depression to post-traumatic stress and OCD if there's no dysfunction in life and that's usually relationships occupational functioning social functioning educational functioning if we don't see problematic behaviors in someone's life then they have worries then they have sadness

[00:07:26] So someone who is sad, who's not feeling great, but they're not acting in ways aligned with depression, it's hard to diagnose them with some version of a depressive disorder. So the short answer is yes. I think if someone is not engaging in behaviors in advance of trying to eliminate the distress, the uncertainty, the the concerns about what's up ahead, then I have a hard time diagnosing someone with a disorder. Um I treat a lot of OCD. I'm in I'm a national OCD specialist. I'm a national

[00:07:54] OCD um treater and trainer for the International OCD Foundation. I'm a national health anxiety specialist. Um I'll call myself an expert. Some people don't like that phrase, but I'm a specialist in those two topics. If someone is not evidencing compulsions or rituals, which is one part of OCD, the other part is obsessions. It's hard for me to diagnose someone who's doing nothing to mitigate or manage those distressing thoughts if what they're doing in turn is living their fullest life. The DSM4 to 5 changed that. The

[00:08:27] DSM5 said first of all moved OCD out of the anxiety disorders and they have it and now it's a category called the obsessivecompulsive and related disorders focused on mostly rituals and repetitive behaviors. Um, and the criteria changed where it used to be you have to have obsessions and compulsions.

[00:08:44] That was DSM4. DSM 5 and 5T now says, well, you have to have one or the other. And so I'm I'm talking to both sides of my mouth. Current diagnostic criteria says if you have obsessions or obtrusive thoughts and you do nothing about it, we can still diagnose you. I don't know if I believe that because if you're doing nothing aligned with that anxiety, which for me, if it's aligned with it, it's shrinking your life and you're having these horrible thoughts and feelings and you don't really engage with them and no one really knows and you're out there living your fullest life. I don't define that as being someone who is impaired or dysfunctional. The problem is I've never met someone who has intrusive thoughts and obsessions and who does nothing. So now we're getting into the next layer of what anxiety is. And you sort of mentioned the word behavioral avoidance.

[00:09:31] Um, anxiety has two kinds of coping. And some of them we can see, we call those overt rituals or behaviors. And some of them are more covert. So right now in this room, I'm using my hands and I'm talking with you and I'm doing stuff to sort of engage with you and I'm answering your question. But in my head, Peter, you may not know that

[00:09:51] I'm second guessing what I just said, wondering if you believe what I said, wondering if I sound good, questioning if I should even be here, wondering if this is going to be a good podcast. And if someone's in that state of thinking about all those things, though, we can't see that. I'm starting to talk about a a concept called a mental ritual. And so in the last 10 to 15 years, we've seen in the anxiety space anxiety specialists not just focusing on what people do behaviorally, but also what they're doing in their head, in their mind. And now we start doing the difference between thoughts, which are passive experiences, and thinking. Thoughts I don't control. I call those the burps, farts, and hiccups of anxiety. They just happen to us. But when you start thinking about those thoughts and trying to neutralize those thoughts and acting in advance of those thoughts and analyzing them and looking them up online and questioning them, that's a mental action. So now we just opened up

[00:10:52] Pandora's box. Anxiety just got bigger. It went from a condition where you're having these unwanted thoughts and feelings and avoiding maybe using substances, maybe trying to avoid a situation, not showing up to a presentation, maybe um staying in bed longer, doing things to not deal with it. In certain conditions, you're washing your hands extra, you're um maybe certain doing certain things to your body. Those are behavioral actions or rituals. But now we have a whole another space of actions or reactions.

[00:11:21] And those mental rituals are, if not as problematic, sometimes worse because the person with lived experience with anxiety often doesn't know their mental rituals. They just think they're obsessing all day long. I hear I hear that a lot. I obsess all day long. And I go, are you obsessing all day long or do you have obsessions or are you sitting there stewing on it? Oh, you're stewing on it. That's a rumination. Yeah, that's an obsession. No, no, no, no. You're ruminating. You're fixated on it. You're trying to quantify it. You're trying to solve it. That's a mental action. Why?

[00:11:52] Because you're trying to diffuse the bomb. You're trying to deal with uncertainty. You can't tolerate uncertainty. You can't tolerate the distress. You're trying to solve this Rubik's cube that's missing a puzzle piece. And so, most therapists can't see that. And the person with lived experience just thinks they're just worrying all day long. And so, we start separating the difference between worries and worrying, thoughts and thinking. The first one is on the house.

[00:12:16] The first one is your body doing exactly what it's supposed to do. The second one is you trying to solve a puzzle that you probably won't be able to solve and you're going to keep doing it and keep doing it and dig deeper and deeper into a hole until you can't get out of it. So most of us are familiar with behavioral manifestations of coping. But mental rituals are equally as destructive and worse hard to identify and see if you don't know what you're asking. Anybody who's spent any time meditating will be very familiar with what you just said about the difference between thoughts and thinking, right? And and I was actually just talking about this with with somebody this morning um as it pertained to mindfulness, right? So the the idea for for folks maybe not not as familiar with the idea that you know if you practice a form of mindfulness meditation, you very quickly you're almost blown away at the torrent of thoughts that exist in your brain and how you can't turn them off. So if you sit there and try to practice a ritual of paying attention to your breath and figuring out how many milliseconds you can go focusing on your breath and nothing else, you realize that the answer is a very short period of time.

[00:13:24] Uh you know maybe unless you've reached some state of enlightenment that I'll never reach. What's basically happening is you're sitting there focusing on your breath and immediately you're going to be thinking about what you want for breakfast and then you lovingly bring yourself back to thinking about the breath and about a millisecond later you realize that you got to do that thing after you know it's just a non-stop it's a ping pong match back it's incredible.

[00:13:48] Um, so say a little bit more about that. Again, for the for the individual who has not practiced this highly uncomfortable exercise of mindfulness meditation, help people understand what you mean about the distinction between thoughts and thinking. It is important. I think it's uniquely important when we talk about anxiety. I like to talk about the W's of that level two thinking. I'm going to break into three categories. We haven't gotten to the third one yet, which is going to get real scary in just a second here. But I like to talk about the W's. The who, what, where, when, why, how, ends in a W. And what if. When

[00:14:29] I hear someone asking a question that starts with a W and whatever the statement is ends with a question mark in my work, if it's about their anxiety core issue, so if someone has social anxiety, the fear of public speaking, if someone has a fear of snakes, the fear of being bitten by a snake, when they're asking questions about is that snake going to be there, does that garden have snakes, or is that public speaking event tomorrow? And what am I going to do about it? And what if they laugh at me?

[00:14:53] When I hear those questions, most of us just think that someone's worried. But that looks productive. It looks like you're trying to figure something out. And for most of us, we just move on with our day. For the anxiety sufferer, it is an attempt to resolve uncertainty. Is an attempt to figure out something that you don't have the chance to figure out because that time has not happened yet.

[00:15:12] It's a fortune-telling mindset of mental action. And so worrying, the verb is an activity. And most of us do it and move on with our lives. It's like teflon. It slides off of us. But for the anxiety sufferer, worrying looks like they're trying to solve something. The problem is is when they get their answer, they're not done.

[00:15:35] And that's the epidemic of anxiety. that whether you do a ritual that looks more behavioral like scrubbing your hands, praying excessively, asking the police officer if they got a report if anyone got run over in the intersection, which is called hit and run OCD, rereading your email 17 times, or wondering about your email, questioning, did I send that out? Was there a typo in there? Are they judging me? What if they say something back to me? Those don't look like rituals or compulsions, but it's our ability to resolve angst, to solve uncertainty, to deal with this inner feeling that is killing us on the inside. And it is its own designation of symptoms. So, um, maybe just to step back, the first thing

[00:16:21] I'm doing in therapy with almost anyone I work with is breaking down symptoms into three categories. And there's two acronyms I'll use. It doesn't matter for me amongst all the anxiety disorders. And I can get kind of Q2 with this, but it's category one, category category two, and category three. Very basic.

[00:16:37] When I use letters, it's T's, O's, and C's if I'm dealing with OCD, which stands for triggers, obsessions, and compulsions. And for almost every other anxiety disorder, it's T, F, and SB, triggers, fears, and safety behaviors. And every DSM, every anxiety specialist, anyone who treats anxiety, and anyone who battles anxiety should know those three levels of symptoms. Triggers are the things that bother you. The events, the people, the places, the things that are out of your control. It's God messing with us. It can sometimes just you sitting around and a thought pops in your head can be a trigger.

[00:17:17] Unfortunately, sometimes a physical symptom can be a trigger. The middle column, which I use the letter O or fear. Um, O for obsession, F for fear, is the internal experiences you're having, and I use the word having, not doing, that are out of your control. Breathing, heart rate, yucky thoughts, upset tummy, a twitch, a feeling, an aura. For most of us, we call those worries or fears or obsessions.

[00:17:47] Sometimes it's an urge. And those are not up to us. That means your body is working. Sometimes it's working in overdrive. Sometimes it means your your prefrontal cortex and your lyic region, we'll talk about brain stuff in a few minutes, I'm sure, are not communicating properly. But that means that something went off in your body as a signal of uhoh, there might be danger. And so it's happening to you. The next thing that happens in the most basic behavioral paradigm, Peter, is stimulus and response.

[00:18:20] And what happens between stimulus and response is where all the magic happens. And one's ability to make decisions effectively between stimulus and response is where therapy really takes takes action. That response in all the anxiety disorders is avoidance, rituals, behavioral or mental. And so it's a therapist's job to figure out those symptoms, the T's, O's, and C's, to educate the patient on what they are, because most patients, and honestly, probably most therapists confuse worries from worrying, thoughts from thinking. And most therapists are going to put anything between your ears in category 2.

[00:19:02] And in the last 10 to 15 years online, there's been um um language and and and descriptions of something called pure occur

[00:19:16] OCD. And what that was was people thinking that I just have obsessions. I pure I'm a purely obsessional subcategory of OCD. And I have pure OCD on my website. I write about it. I blog about it because I want people who think they have that to find our website and to find us because I want to reverse engineer what they think is going on. They think they're just having obsessions cuz it's all happening up here. What's really going on is they're having obsessions and then spending all day long up here trying to solve an existential crisis, which I would call a mental ritual.

[00:19:49] Let's help people understand that. And we can either use in fact I' I'd like to do both. I'd like to use thoughts versus thinking and I'd like to use worry versus worrying to help people understand when they've crossed that threshold. Um, so start with whichever one you want and let's pick a real world example that you might experience in the practice. Well, I want to talk about health and medical stuff. So, someone's having a bunch of physical symptoms and they're afraid that they might have cancer. They're afraid that they might have cancer. That's a worry. They're afraid that these might be symptoms of a heart attack, of an MI event. That's a worry.

[00:20:31] What if I'm having a heart attack? All of a sudden, you're trying to figure it out. Which, by the way, asking that doesn't figure it out. And googling it doesn't figure it out. And calling your cardiologist who hasn't seen you doesn't figure it out. But when you go, go what what if this is a heart attack symptom? You're beyond worrying about it. The worry is I might be sick.

[00:20:48] In this case, having a medical event, and you're trying to figure out like, what if this is the thing? And when you're trying to figure it out, that's no different than googling it. That's no different than looking it up online, calling your nurse or doctor friend or or in-law and saying, "Do you think this is what it is?" So when I go to someone and go, "Hey, do you think that's what this is?" Most people would call that reassurance seeking, which is a classic ritual. It's a behavioral thing. Me asking you, "Hey, you have not evaluated me. You're my brother-in-law. Do you think this is a medical event?" But when you ask yourself that, how is it any different? we haven't evaluated you.

[00:21:23] There's no lab work. We're not really going to get the answer. And are you really just looking for one answer? You're fine. So, the dilemma is is when you go from that worry state to oh my gosh, I'm terrified I might be sick to what if I'm sick? What if this is the event? People can spend not that that little moment, but all day wondering, is is that is that another thing? Is that a heart issue? Is is that a symptom of stroke? My eyes twitching. Does that mean I'm having a seizure? when they start asking themselves a litany of questions, that's not the worry. The worry is just, I'm scared something's wrong. I'm scared something bad's going to happen. When you sit there and start questioning it all, to me, it's no different than just sitting there and googling all day long, what are these symptoms? And everyone would look, anyone would look at that and go, of course, that person's ritualizing. But when you do it inside, it's the same mechanism. It's you trying to get to the end of the story. you're using your crystal ball or time machine to get to the end of that story sooner than you actually need to. And in that case, if you're having a real medical event, I'd go to the doctor. I'd actually go see a physician. But sitting there questioning it doesn't solve anything. So, you went from a state of having worries, I'm afraid I'm sick, I'm afraid something's wrong, to sitting there, I won't use the word peverating because that usually means something else, but ruminating on it. And that's looks functional, but it's actually quite dysfunctional. Is it dysfunctional because of the duration? Is it dysfunctional because it comes at the expense of doing something else? Or is it dysfunctional because if an objective person were to evaluate it on its face, it doesn't make any sense? Now, I know I've said a lot there, but to me, this is the crux of it, right?

[00:22:58] I'm going to be able to answer that with one word. Yes. It's dysfunctional because it's taking away from your life. It's dysfunctional because the duration or intensity of it doesn't match the thing. meaning that if you're spending all your time doing that and not going to the doctor, this is not going to solve anything. Um, so in a single moment, anyone freaking out, I don't think that's dysfunctional, Peter. That's that's what any one of us would do. You know, you you sent an email and go, "Oh, shoot. Did I just do that?" We all do that. Oh, man. This this this feels tight in my chest. What what is that? We all do that. So even the criteria for something like health anxiety um the DSM criteria requires 6 months of being concerned about whether it's about symptoms or diseases. We'll talk about different kinds of health anxiety in a few minutes. 6 months. So in a single singular moment it's nothing more than you being inquisitive and curious. But the point is is that's not going to solve whether it's a medical event or not. Going to your doctor is getting an

[00:23:54] EK E EKG is asking your nurse sister if you're having like a stroke. What does she know? So, it doesn't solve the problem and it's trying to get to the end of a story or or resolve some uncertainty um or some ambiguity in a way that's not actually going to solve it. So, it's just not a functional way to process in a singular moment, in a single moment, the first time, I don't care. You don't care. It's what someone does. But when you're doing that multiple times a day, multiple times a week, or for months on end, that's the disease. Now what about the individual who uh goes out to seek medical attention for something but the pattern is so illogical. So they they just keep having sort of unexplained um symptoms.

[00:24:43] Mhm. And they they create a story that says this is cancer or this is heart disease or this is whatever and they follow through with the medical checkup as they should. Yeah. And the medical checkup keeps coming back crystal clear. You're you're fine. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. And the goalpost keeps moving. So, it's I think I've got this. I think I've got that. I think

[00:25:03] I've got this. I think I've got that. Everything they get checked up for is fine. Is that health anxiety? That's possibly health anxiety. Um, and first of all, health anxiety is not a disorder. It's a class of disorders. It's a it's a buzzword online. It's something you can Google. But the disorders within them there's they break down into really two sometimes three disorders. One's called illness anxiety disorder which used to be called hypocchondriasis and one's called sematic symptom disorder which used to be called sematapform disorder. And then there's a third one that's a bit curious which is conversion disorders or functional neurological disorders. But what you're saying is is in this case someone has some set of symptoms and whether the symptoms stay or change they're going to doctor after doctor. They've had all the appropriate medical workups and every doctor said negative result, negative result, negative result. I have to be careful how I talk about this. I've done other podcasts where I've said a story like this that I'm about to share and

[00:25:58] I've triggered some people and I'm not trying to upset people or trigger people, but in your situation, I feel very comfortable probably saying it sounds a lot like a health anxiety kind of disorder. You're having physical ailments. You're going to doctors to figure out what's going on. We would most commonly diagnose that as sematic symptom disorder. If your medical charts are clear, if the doctors have consistently said, "Ma'am, sir, I'm sorry, but there's nothing there." The problem is is you and I both have anecdotal stories of someone getting a breast exam, going for their annual, going for a papsme. They've had all the medical clearance, and all of a sudden, a month later, they find a p-siz shape under their armpit. Oh my goodness, they have breast cancer. So, I have a personal story. I won't spend too much time on it. Where my wife, I was almost a widow about a decade ago. Um, which is not funny to me. Um, she was having some radiating discomfort and pain going up her right abdomen and backside and she's thin and healthy and we have no history of medical issues and went to a primary care doctor who we trusted dearly and he's checked her out and said, "You might have a tiny umbilical hernia.

[00:26:58] You're young. You're healthy. You're thin. Don't worry about it." And we said, "Okay, we'll see what happens." And a week later, she's still complaining. We then go to her OB and OB did a full exam and found absolutely nothing. We then went to a surgeon um who the OB recommended just to make sure and I'm not I don't remember honestly what the surgeon did. I know we had I think an ultrasound and a CT I believe and surgeon said I would not do an umbilical surgery right now. You're fine. You're young. Let's wait on it.

[00:27:21] Nothing's going on. Those are three doctors who basically gave her a clean bill of health with some superficial observation and then some very basic non-invasive procedures. And then about a week later she said, "Josh, it's not going away." and I something's not right and it's raining up my back and they check for gallstones, they check for kidney stones and all this sort of standard stuff, blood work, ur analysis, all of it. And uh someone said, "Why don't you go to a GI specialist and see what's going on?" And she went there and she had a mass on her liver that was compromised over 50%. And uh that required immediate surgery. If that had ruptured her blood out, she would have possibly died. Um the liver is one of the is the only organ that regenerates itself. So we got very lucky. um had a significant re resection liver uh liver surgery um and um she's doing well today. But if we waited on that and took three nos as okay, I guess she's take some ibuprofen, stretch, maybe it's gas, you know, figure it out. I don't want to know the answer to that end of that story. So the problem is is sometimes we have to trust our own bodies and sometimes we can't trust the doctor. In your situation, I think if you're chasing symptoms, you've been to multiple doctors with multiple multiple workups and everyone's saying it's nothing that we can diagnose. For most of us, we're describing that you have some physical anomalies going on that maybe don't require medical intervention. And so now in the health anxiety spectrum, we're now starting to describe symptoms in three categories.

[00:28:47] Symptoms that are medical, symptoms that are physical, and symptoms that are psychological. So, in all the health anxiety spectrums, we break those symptoms into three categories. If they're medical and require medical intervention and you worry about them, no kidding. So, you and I would as well. And whether we call that an adjustment reaction, Peter, or something else, if you have a medical condition that requires medical intervention, you worry about it. Most of us do. And I don't require a therapist or medication for that, unless that's something that you want. If you're having physical symptoms that are not deemed medical, either because the lab lab reports are not back yet or because the doctor, you know, hasn't talked to you yet or because the lab results are negative. At some point, we have to admit maybe there's nothing medical here unless we're like waiting for lab results. But the worry associated with that we would typically describe as sematic symptom disorder.

[00:29:37] You don't know what you have yet. You may have nothing and you're worrying about it and not leaving the house and doctor shopping and going online and checking your labs and wearing a pulse oxometer and all the things you're doing to constantly monitor physical symptoms. Body scanning, checking, pretty common ones. At some point, your quality of life is going down. Could something medical come from that? Absolutely. But currently, we have no data to support that you have a medical condition and you're still worried about it. We have an issue. And then the other category is when it's all psychological. long time ago it was about AIDS that we don't see that that much anymore but someone's afraid they're going to get AIDS they're afraid they're going to have a a stroke a brain tumor no symptoms to support it um they're just worried about getting an illness or disease back in the day people would call that person hypochondrial the disorder was called hypocchondriasis and today we call that illness anxiety disorder um and people can have all three they can have medical issues a they can have physical issues that are not medical and worry about them and they can also worry about getting other diseases which we would illness, anxiety disorder. But the most common presentation that I see in my practice and that people reach out to me for is when someone has a kind of a combination of physical things and they're convinced it's something. And usually by the time they're reaching out to me, they've been to multiple doctors. I don't when someone reaches out to an anxiety specialist with physical things, the first thing I would say and you would say is go get a workup. So I'm never going to get in the way of medical care.

[00:30:59] Not first, second, and third opinions. I think it's a smart thing to do. Um but at some point, when is enough enough? If every doctor who is of quality and competence has ruled out whatever you think is going on and even then people go to great lengths. I've had patients get spinal taps off the record for cash to determine if they have cere a leaking

[00:31:18] CSF because they think they're having a stroke or having I think that's one of the things I guess I would say that makes that playbook challenging is in this day and age you have more and more sort of um I don't know for lack of a better word just quacks out there that are going to come up with every reason under the sun for your symptoms. So you will find somebody who will come up with an explanation for your symptom.

[00:31:44] It'll be the mold in your house. It'll be the uh slight elevation of cadmium uh you know in your blood or radon cat litter. Go down the list. Absolutely. So now we've opened a Pandora's box which is this individual who's feeling a little fatigued. can't figure out why something's wrong with them. They're fatigued. Maybe I maybe it's, you know, fill in the blank. I I don't know what it is. Um, first doctor they see does traditional work up and says, "I I you know, you're all your hormones look great. I don't, you know, everything that I can see looks." But but you're going to find that person within the first three, depending on which door you open, who's going to come up with a with an explanation. And they're typically going to have a solution for you that's pretty off the beaten path. If you go to a car mechanic and say your car is squeaking in the engine, they're going to have a wonderful solution for your engine, even if it's not required. If you go to a psychiatrist and say, "I think I need meds." Guess what? They're going to give you medication. And if you go to enough doctors, they're going to they're going to find some problem and recommend some intervention, whether it's homeopathic, whether it's diagnostic, you know, whether it's a prescription, something. They'll give you something because they want you to feel better. Yeah. I think part of it is the when you're a hammer, everything is a nail syndrome. But I I I think that and that would be the most charitable explanation for what I think is going on, which is truly there are just a lot of real charlatans out there um that are, you know, just not not practicing any form of reasonable medicine, not even evidence informed, right? Like evidence-based I get has its limitations and I will fully acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based medicine.

[00:33:24] Agree. But but but there is at least still a threshold of evidenceinformed medicine. But when you start saying that the answer to your slightly elevated seesium level, which by the way, no lab has ever documented what the upper limit of that should be anyway, but let's just assume that my arbitrary level is too high and you're slightly above it. So that's clearly the explanation of everything that's going wrong with you.

[00:33:49] And I'm going to hand you some supplement that, by the way, I happen to also sell. Happened to sell. I just happen to sell. How lucky are you? Look, it's it's your lucky day. It's right here too, by the way. It's in the office. You found the guy that knows how to cure elevated seesium levels. Um, that that's the challenge I suppose I have, right? Which is it's the challenge

[00:34:09] I have. You we're in the same boat where you're asking me to as a non-medical person to make sure that someone is getting, you know, uh, advocated for, spoken for, and referred to by providers. They're going to go to find anyone. And I'm I'm it's above my pay grade to know whether that doctor knows what they're doing, whether they're recommending medications or off label things that are uh and how am I going to argue against that? So yeah, most anxiety specialists like myself who work in the space of a lot of health and medical and I have a career where we haven't talked about where I've done lots of medical training, medical work in my career. Um um I'm informed, I'm knowledgeable, I also have medical people in my family. I can ask the right things, but I'm trusting um the medical people around me. So I'm on faculty at a university in Atlanta. Um I'm adjunct faculty there. I got colleagues there. I got medical people around me. I surround myself with people that I think are sharp psychiatrists, physicians, oncologist just in case and still my patients are going to go to other doctors because they're just looking for the answer. To me, that's sort of within that health anxiety spectrum. If every doctor you've gone to that I trust has given you the best medicine possible or the best assessment possible and you're getting no answer and you go to the next person, you don't need the DSM to go, maybe this is more than just a medical issue. I'm still going to advocate for the medical needs. I'm still going to support them and join them and I'm still going to help them see that your physical symptoms are real. Physical symptoms are real. That doesn't mean they're indicative of or prognosticate a medical condition. Half the battle I'm doing is education around that topic.

[00:35:37] Yeah, I think it's worth stating that again. Right. So, if a person says, "I'm experiencing this pain," that's real 100%. You're just saying, don't assume necessarily that that means that there is an underlying medical reason for that or even something that you would find on the total best case scenario diagnostic. more often than not there's not a great medical diagnosis or category that fits into the things that someone like I I mean I see I mean

[00:36:10] I don't specialize that much in FND or um sort of that that functional neurological space of pseudo seizures or or tingling arms or body parts that can go numb. That's a that's a whole another space of conversion disorders. But I'm talking about people that have chronic headaches. Yep. tummy issues, leg cramps, bones that feel sore, and they've had every workup you could imagine that would be considerate for someone who has bones that are sore. And there's about three or four conditions most of us are going to jump to and you say, "Your bones are sore." And when that's all been ruled out, and they try and convince you, but my my my thigh, like I I can feel the bone. I can feel the marrow feels like it's it's tearing itself up. And we were talking about pain conditions. We're talking about, you know, neuropathic kind of conditions. At some point, the intervention, which is them doctor shopping, becomes worse than the pain itself. At some point, someone will prescribe you something, and hopefully we're not dealing with opiates at that point, but someone will prescribe you something thinking that they have the magical cure to fix your distress, your pain. Um, and that scares me. And my job is to sit with them and say the pain is real, the sensation is real, the symptom is real, but it not may not really be indicative of the thing that you think it could be. And by the way, going on

[00:37:23] WebMD or Google or because a social media influencer said, "If you have this, this is probably what it is," does not diagnose you. And so there's really this wonderful space of social media, wearable devices, which I'm a big believer of. Um, and the access that we all have to our medical records scares the hell out of me because we are now patients being our own advocates. And showing up to doctors saying, "This is what I found out online and I think I have this or this is what this person said and I think I have this or my I'm looking at my watch here. My heart my heart rate's been up all week. Doesn't that mean something?" Yeah, it means your heart rate's up. Period. That doesn't have to mean anything else except your heart rate is up. And so most people would assume that means you're, you know, at risk for a heart attack or a stroke. Or it means if you stare at your watch long enough, you don't have hair on your head like I do, but if we talk about lice, guess what's going to happen in a few seconds? We're both going to be doing this because that's what happens. And if I mention your left pinky toe, Peter, have you thought about your left pinky toe this entire time we've been together? Cuz you are. Now, how's the toe next to it doing? And by the way, now how's the right pinky toe going? Now we get to think about that stuff. You think about that long enough, you're going to feel your left pinky toe. It's going to be tactile and sticky and maybe sensory. It was there the whole time. Your brain didn't have to think about it. How's your breathing right now? We don't think about breathing. And I treat people who get fixated on swallowing breathing.

[00:38:41] There's got to be something in here. I have thyroid cancer. I have esophageal cancer because I feel something in there. You probably do feel something in there. By the way, if you do this all day long and you create some some bruising, you're going to feel a whole bunch of more stuff in there. You know that better than I do. But to convince someone that there may not be something in there because they've been scoped and tested and blood checked and there's no signs of anything that's anatomical or physical in their throat, but they can feel it. It's not my job to say it's fake. It's my job to say you're just you're struggling with something and what are we going to do about that?

[00:39:12] And that's is the is the message there. Do you go one step further and say like you're creating this or are you saying no, I don't need to go that far. I just need to get them to understand there's another explanation for this. There's no need to do that because if I take that stance, I'm now the next person who's the naysayer. I'm the next one who's invalidating them. And almost no therapist that I know would ever basically weaponize that or blame them for that kind of thing. What I can say is you may not have created it and they you probably didn't create it. Like leg pain is not being created, but if you sit there and focus on your left pinky toe or if we talk about lice long enough, it's going to create head sensations of itch. That's how it works.

[00:39:53] When you focus on something long enough, you pay attention to it. And if you pay attention to it, you're more aware of it. And if you're more aware of it and your brain actually works, it'll feel it. Phantom limb syndrome research has demonstrated that. People putting a dummy arm and a fake arm in a mirror and whacking an arm, we can feel that in our nerve endings because our brain's processing information. So, do we have a dead arm that's not connected to that's actually causing pain? No. Do we have a a pain reception or an information processing thing going on? probably that's fascinating research. The point is is I don't have to tell them that it's your fault or that you're creating it. But I can tell them that the thing you're doing is keeping it active. It's keeping it prominent in your in your focus. And as long as you focus on that, you're not focusing on anything else.

[00:40:38] And if you're not focusing anything else, we have a whole another disease. Disease one, there's something wrong with your thigh. Maybe not medical. Disease two, you're fixated on it. You won't leave the house. You're demanding opiates. You're complaining to people. Your husband doesn't want to hear anymore. Your doctors have cut you off.

[00:40:55] And I've worked with patients I'm in Atlanta that have been blacklisted from two or the three major hospital medical systems because they've done so much doctor shopping and so much fighting with their doctors that it's a stress on the system. But they have the wearables and the social media and the online and access to their patient portal that proves that something's wrong. And just as an example, what types of things would they actually be doctor shopping for? What is this? What's a symptom that's a real world example?

[00:41:20] The ones I usually see the most are memory loss or memory slip-ups, which some people would actually put into the functional neurological disorder spectrum. Um, a lot of chest pain that has had every EKG in medical workup you can imagine. Um, or sensations like ants crawling or physical pain, neuropathic pain for which it has no explanation.

[00:41:39] Those are the most common ones which is and let's just take each of those if in as much as you know details. I mean what would be triggering events, right? And and where I'll tell you where I want to kind of go with this, which is I want to understand the genetic factors that would pre predispose a person to this versus the environmental factors that would predispose an individual to this. Um, you know, I've had a number of folks on this podcast where we've we've talked at length about the heritability of various psychiatric in uh uh illnesses. Um so you know what you know again using concordant and discordant twin studies we can get a pretty good sense of how these things work and we know that with health anxiety uh

[00:42:19] I the heritability is about 30 to 40% it's on the lower side so so it's low compared to where we see with schizophrenia autism are very high on the 70s to 80s sometimes right so so it's there it's there's a genetic loading that's there yep but when you say 30% heritability I hear environmental so do I so do I I hear in the dia stress model. Yeah, the diiathesis is there.

[00:42:42] It's low, but it just takes that right context to make it come alive. And and for some populations, for some people we work with a trauma. Trauma can induce this. Trauma can cause all sorts of physical manifestations of discomfort and distress and pain. Whether that's a physical or sexual trauma or an emotional trauma or loss. There's enough research and large-scale studies to demonstrate even with um pseudo uh um um seizures um panes um psychoggenic non-epileptic seizures that um emotional and physical traumas um can demonstrate then bodily reactions that are not explained which we used to call conversion disorder. So trauma is a notable thing. Family history of it where parents are complaining and describing similar symptoms. So I see that quite a bit. I see that both with

[00:43:24] OCD. OCD has a heritability rate of about 50%, 40 to 50%. Health anxiety is a little bit lower um in both populations. And what about general anxiety? Um so I don't general anxiety like I I go by disorder unfortunately. Okay. So um if I go by disorder I can tell you but in general anxiety I assume it's probably still in that 30 to 40% range just in general. I don't know of any other disorder outside of OCD that has a higher heritability rate of there's nine anxiety disorders I usually refer to.

[00:43:51] That one usually has the highest genetic. That's the 40 to 50%. That's 40 45%. So I assume across the board if we merge them all together, we're going to be in that 30 to 40% range at best. It's very atypical for me to meet a child or teen with OCD and to not have a firstdegree relative who has it. Doesn't mean the first degree relative has sought treatment or agrees with it, but almost every child's like, "Oh yeah, my mom does the exact same thing."

[00:44:14] And do you think that it is a learned behavior in that sense? I I well we have to not deny that there's a genetic component to it but when you are in a household where someone is doing things in a very hypervigilant way constantly or always washing down the counters or always doing things on repeat like tapping the door or asking you to say something over and over and over again at some point social learning kicks in and they won't necessarily be the same.

[00:44:41] So in other words, if mom washes her hands a hundred times a day, Johnny could easily manifest what? Clothing folding or ruminating on some other Yeah. You're describing a lot of the subcontent areas of OCD. I don't know if there's any research study out there that has demonstrated that parents subclassification of OCD mimics child, but at a macro OCD falls down to the next generation. It's pretty well documented. Um, if if I've seen a 100 people in the last year with OCD, I haven't seen that many in the last year.

[00:45:13] I'd be shocked if more than 15 didn't have a first-degree relative that had OCD. It'd be very atypical that they are seeing. Say again. That they see that they live with that they live with or have lived with. So, it would just be very uncommon which makes it difficult to parse out how much it's very difficult to know genetic versus nurture. It's very difficult.

[00:45:31] Health anxiety for me is almost identical. So, I view health anxiety as a subcategory of OCD. Um, I think probably 20 years ago, probably people viewed the HIV focus much more as an OCD condition. Today we would call it illness anxiety disorder, but most of the colleagues I work with, the people I've done research with, people that I talk about this stuff with, view health anxiety as a subcategory. Academically, it's its own special category in the

[00:45:55] DSM. Um, but I see the exact same things that you're asking about, which is that it is very rare for me to see someone has health anxiety, for which a first-degree relative doesn't also have health anxiety. And health anxiety, OCD for most populations usually starts around age 7 8 n prepubescent. Um, health anxiety usually starts around the teenage years. A few kids I've seen can have health anxiety. Epidemological research would support that health anxiety typically starts in teenage years and young adulthood. Um, I see kids with aophobia, fear, throw up, kids that complain of tummy aches because they're afraid to go to school. I think they're more f focused on situational symptoms in response to situations than what you and I would think about more existential dread about health anxiety.

[00:46:35] So it' be a little bit unconventional for a kid to be thinking about morbidity and mortality and things like that cuz kids are not developed to worry about that in general though it can be the case. Um but it'd be very unconventional for me to see someone who has health anxiety where they wouldn't say yeah my mom also worried about that. A metophobia is no different. A fear of throwup very common in family in family dynamics. So first thing when I see someone who has a fear of throatophobia, which one of your family members also has that fear? It's like the first question you ask. Oh, that one. Great.

[00:47:02] Now that I know biologic, behavioral, both. So you've referenced HIV and AIDS twice. Is that really the first big landmark introduction of widespread health anxiety or is it just the most recent one prior to our current? It's probably the loudest. Um, I mean, we you can go back if you want to do research on this, go back in Grecian, ancient time, people focused on this stuff and did brain mapping. And I joked you before we started talking I use the word tffenation. All sorts of crazy psycho brain surgeries to help people alleviate stuff. But the HIV ep epidemic probably became the most prominent thing in the last 30 to 40 years that got people's awareness of what if I get that terrible disease because we don't know enough about it. The treatments weren't available at the time. The life expectancy was short and that scared everyone. But you could look at trends in the last 10 years and when I get together with all my colleagues and we nerd out about this stuff, you can see trends during Black Lives Matter movement a few years ago and the um hashtagme too movement when you see people coming in fearful of like what if

[00:47:57] I say a racial slur? What if I get accused of sexually assaulting someone in in the past and and you see those those socio kind of driven moments where you see spikes of people coming in concerned about that. CO lit that on fire literally. Um, and there's still lingering effects of that that we can discuss. But I I don't know if I've seen an HIV concern in the last 5 to 10 years. I mean, just don't hear it. But and I used to work I I've done a lot of work in HIV and STD prevention. I've worked in HIV clinics. I did an NIH research fellowship on HV HIV and STD.

[00:48:29] So, I've been in the I'm a weird psychologist, but I've done lots of medically based research and clinical work. So, I've been in the HIV space actually for about 20 years as an OCD, anxiety specialist. I I'm sure I have colleagues that could say speak to this. I haven't heard someone complain about HIV, concerned about getting it in my in my career probably in the last 10, 15 years. But you name every other condition. Stroke, heart attack,

[00:48:49] Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, every kind of cancer. I mean, cancer is the most notorious. It's the loudest. It's the scariest. It's what everyone talks about. Um, is is that signal getting louder? Yes. Okay. Okay. So, let's now go over the three things you alluded to earlier. Social media, wearables, and access to medical records. Is there anything else that you think is contributing to that?

[00:49:10] Let's assume genetic drift is not increasing the genetic predisposition to that so that the increase that you see in the incident is environmental or triggered. Anything else driving it besides those three you think? So, those are those are research based me citing those things. I'm going to speak more on a personal anecdotal level. I have a general sense that in the last five years since the pandemic and since we've seen a shift in culture around medical access and insurance and people getting proper care and political things and turmoil, I think most mental health providers and epi research would show this, Peter, that we've seen a significant increase in mental health awareness, a significant increase in people coming to therapy for the first time, a significant ificant increase in people staying in therapy longer and longer and we've seen a significant spike in general anxiety since 2020 almost a two-fold spike in most research studies. So all of that combined with a general sense of not being able to afford health care or frustration with your health care providers,

[00:50:17] I just feel like we're hitting this unfortunate, perfect, terrible storm of people being more vigilant about their medical and mental health needs in good ways, trying to be advocates, and trying to seek services. But also, I think we're I think we are as at least in the United States, there's just a general sense of increased anxiety and stress on all of us. And as you know, stress and anxiety turns sematic, turns biologic.

[00:50:43] Um, but I think those three big areas of social media, wearables, and access to healthcare are big players. But COVID got all of us to think about this stuff. And I was joking with some of your team before I came in here, but even on the flight over here, someone was coughing in the row behind me and I thought, crap, what am I going to come home with? 2019, never would have thought that, honestly. 2018, not I have I have kids.

[00:51:04] I have a kid going to college and a 14-year-old. when they were kids, they had snots and boogers and gross and diarrhea and you pumped them with meds and sent them to preschool. You just didn't care. Today, when when your kid's sick, you're thinking, "How many days of work am I going to miss?" So, somewhere in the last few years, and I don't I don't battle health anxiety. I don't get too caught up on that. I think about it more than I want to um because of the work I do, but somewhere in the last few years, we've all become more in tune to our upper respiratory stuff. And people are wearing masks before they never did.

[00:51:30] In other countries, in China and Japan, we saw people wearing masks before the pandemic. We see this all over the United States now. I was at a restaurant just a few minutes before I came over here and three people wearing masks. Do they have it? Are they trying to prevent me from getting it? Are they afraid of them getting it? I don't know. But five years ago, I didn't see anyone any restaurant person wearing a mask.

[00:51:47] By the way, would there be any pathology there? Explain. Well, if you see a person wearing a mask and let's just say you make the assumption that they're not sick, so they're not doing No, I know. I know. I'm saying I'm making that assumption. If you if you if you see people walking through airports with masks. Yes.

[00:52:02] Um uh and again I'm not trying to ask this question through sort of uh any any lens other than pure inquiry. And I realize these are very loaded questions, but what I'm really trying to understand is if a person's walking through an airport wearing a mask and you knew that they were not sick, so they're doing it for fear of getting sick.

[00:52:19] Is there any reason to say that person's not psychologically functioning on all cylinders at the moment? It depends on their situation. So my m my mom who's doing very well today. Sorry. Let me further assume that she was battling cancer. Yeah. True. Okay. No, no. I'm gonna throw all that out. So So you're not immune compromised. You're you're you're a 40year-old perfectly healthy person who's not undergoing chemo. You don't live with someone who's underg

[00:52:46] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm just trying to get at like it's a fair question, but you you're a person who precoid would have never thought of wearing a mask, but you haven't escaped the co mindset. Now, you could argue, well, what's it? It's not causing anybody harm. It's their face they're covering up. I mean, aside from the fact that the barista at Starbucks can't take their order. Like, no one's actually paying a price. Is there is this any is there any maladaptive behavior there?

[00:53:09] Uh, sounds like a a real therapist here, a real psychologist. Possibly. I think if that mask is being used as a cover to avoid social interactions, as a way to get out of other events, to make sure you're not working in a certain part of the restaurant, possibly, when you really don't need to do so. If you're just wearing the mask because you're just a little bit extra cautious, don't want to get sick. Again, if we don't care about it and you stay employed, let's say it's an employ or you're walking through the airport, I don't think there's anything pathological about that. I I think that's no different than someone you taking um what are those like um those vitamin C packets before they get in a plane.

[00:53:40] People do that all the time. Costco and other companies sell boxes and boxes of stuff. Do I think that stuff works? Not really. But people are pounding that vitamin C powder stuff to make sure when they go on their flight or their travel, they don't get sick. Um is that any different? I I don't know if it's any different. I think we all take our own approaches for homeopathics and I'd put the mask in that category of people who are taking over-the-counter kind of things or supplements to boost their immunity or to pre prevent themselves from catching something that would compromise their immunity. I think good for them and I don't think anything about it.

[00:54:10] What about driving with a mask on? You're the only person if you're not an Uber driver or if I the other day saw someone driving down the freeway. They're the only person in their car. I assume it was their car, but there was nobody else in it and they were driving with a mask. So again, I'm if it wasn't a rental car, now if it was a rental car, you might go, gosh, like I could see what if they thought again, I think that's pathological to me and I think we can probably say both are, but if you're in a rental car and you and I both know how the transmission of respiratory issues go and you're in a rental car that's whether been cleaned or not, someone smoked in it, someone coughed in it, by the time you get in it, we're beyond that potential range of infection from from CO or other respiratory ailments.

[00:54:49] Wearing a mask isn't going to do a darn thing medically. I'm not a medical provider. I got to be careful I say that on this on on here, but I know enough about the science that that's not how you're going to get some kind of disease. That baffles me. Is that pathological? It looks funny. It doesn't make sense to me. Maybe it's they're going to be going to the next place and they forgot to take it off. Maybe they are imunompromised. I don't know what their situation is, but if to your point, if someone doesn't have an illness and they're not trying to spread it and we don't believe they have any state of im imuninompromis compromised status and they're wearing a mask, it seems off. And so, should the majority of people who are not wearing masks look at that person with empathy as opposed to disdain, which is probably how most people look at that individual? I think anyone who's in a situation like like that would look at someone with empathy, with compassion, and think that that's not my situation. And I hope that whatever they're going through is okay.

[00:55:38] But again, we start talking about like what you can see and what you can't see. Going back several discussions ago about mental versus behavioral. I've never been in a podcast and someone said, "Hey, what do you think about people taking emergency or vitamin C or whatever, whatever those powders are?"

[00:55:51] No one's ever asked me that. Is that different than wearing a mask? Not to me, but we can see the mask. It is a little different. And I think that's the point, right? I think it's a if if you take the the vitamin C pack, you you're putting it in your water, you're drinking it for all intents and purposes, you're taking a bunch of electrolytes. The person who takes that next step to put a mask on presumably in an environment where nobody else is wearing it. Oh, I'm sorry. Not I was talking about in the airport and other situations or restaurants in a car situation. That feels pathological to me.

[00:56:22] Sure. No, even in the airport. My point is they're doing it in an environment where nobody else is wearing a mask. There must be some that that to me is a higher threshold. They're more concerned. Absolutely. They're they're focused on it more than the rest of us. And my one might argue then maybe the rest of us should be focused on it as well. And I just don't feel like that I

[00:56:40] I have to I have to do that. But I I think but how would you talk to that person? So let's assume that that that I'm I'm making this up. This is completely untrue. Let's say my wife can't stop wearing a mask everywhere we go. This is not true. Just for all her friends listening. I'm not ratting out my wife who never wears a mask. But let's just assume my poor wife can't stop wearing the mask. And I'm getting kind of annoyed. I'm like, "Honey, this is getting a little ridiculous. Every time we go out for dinner, you're wearing a mask." Like, frankly, I'm embarrassed.

[00:57:07] And she's like, "Peter, I just, you know, I just I just don't I just don't want to get sick. I just I don't want the downtime." Uh, you know, she comes up with whatever seemingly rational argument she has, and I said, "I get it, honey, but when I'm sitting across from you at dinner, I like to see your face."

[00:57:24] Sure. She's like, "I appreciate that you like my face, but I just can't afford to get sick. I like my health." Yeah. Yeah. And so, let's say we present to you for therapy. Okay. Tell me how you're going to engage. First of all, I see this all the time. It's just metaphorically, it's not the mask. It's the romantic partner that I see quite a bit in my work because I run national romantic partner support groups. Free support groups for people around the world. Me and a colleague in

[00:57:48] California and yesterday for my hotel, I ran ran one of those. We see us all the time. It's just feel free to come up with a better example cuz this is this is just a dumb one I came up with. No, the example is is I have a romantic partner and his or his or her partner come in saying my partner is never going to events or my partner is constantly scrubbing down the the counter or my partner makes sure that we have to have our shoes off before we walk in or my partner makes me say I love you 17 different ways before we go to bed because the version I said wasn't good enough. It's the same point which is what that what the person with I'm going use the phrase lived experience which is a pretty colloquial common phrase for a mental health person to say that someone has some something. So I'm I'm I guess

[00:58:23] I'm already making the case that they might have a condition but I see quite often when the person with lived experience is doing excessive behaviors that's causing impairment and disruption to the people around them. So we'll use your example. You said Josh can't that word means a lot to me can't take it off. She won't. I can't even see her face at dinner. In that first meeting,

[00:58:43] I'm trying to figure out not Peter, what's wrong with that? Why can't you get over? Because I know why you can't get over it. I'm trying to understand from wife's perspective, what is it doing for her life? What is she solving? And I'm trying to her hear her story to figure out, do I have any inroads in here to figure out how rational this is really getting? How how functional it really is? And and so in the interventions for health anxiety or OCD are starting to talk about cognitive behavioral interventions. I'm using motivational interviewing techniques and socratic questioning with a lot of compassion and kindness to try and hear her story, hear her concerns cuz you're just the husband. You're sick and tired of it.

[00:59:17] I'm coming in with a short fuse at this point. Y but ultimately I I have a sense of my job is to help her figure out is there any wiggle room in wearing this? And I probably may not do that in the first meeting, but I'm going to start assessing other areas of her life that she's not doing that are probably more protective. And every person who does my work knows the research is undeniable.

[00:59:36] Not getting on a plane is the funniest thing in the world because if you drive a car, you're not paying at all to stat to statistics because driving in a car within 5 miles of the radius of your house is the most likely place you're going to get into. Maybe not a fatal car accident, but a car accident. Airplanes, despite all the stuff in the last six months to two years, is still by far statistically the safest form of transportation by the millions and millions of people that fly. But it feels terrifying when we start seeing, you know, planes colliding and things happening and changes with the FAA and stuff. So, but no one looks at that and goes, I'm going to change my situation.

[01:00:06] I'm just not going to get in an airplane, but they drive. So, I'm trying to find those moments with your wife. I'm trying to figure out what is the value for her. Does she see that it's impacting her husband and her friendships? Does she see that it's limiting opportunities in her life? I'm trying to find what's the cost and is there any way for that cost to outweigh the benefit of what she is not being imunocmpromised for. I'm also trying to find out what other curious behaviors is she doing that look like the mask as well. Is she washing her hands a little bit extra? Does she keep hand sanitizer on her? Does she refuse to shake hands?

[01:00:36] Does she make sure she brings her own straw? And so how often do you see that where um a person shows up and there's sort of one chief complaint but then upon further probing there's a a series of concentric circles that are they're building out from it. It's the whole point of the success of therapy because you're the answer is all the time. So it's rarely isolated very rare where I see a single anomalous symptom behavior or action being the only thing that is worthy of attention or treatment. Um, you can go as far as to play this out in substance abuse and eating disorders. There might be the primary substance substance or eating behavior someone's engaging in. Trust me, there are other characterological and other tendencies that someone's engaging in that may not look as dysfunctional or um impairing, but they're there. They're under the surface and a lot of them are probably happening. So, I'm assuming that she's spending time at the restaurant also scanning who's coughing. also seeing when the waiter brought the the credit card machine, if that still exists, the the the the fold out of their butt back pocket. How disgusting is that, Peter?

[01:01:41] That that the waiters and waitresses stick that in their butt back pocket or in their pants and they pull it out and ask us to pay for it. Like, that's foul. Does that make you stop from paying? No. Most of us don't care about that. But that's pretty messed up. Do you really think that a person didn't go to the bathroom and do you really think they washed their hands every single time? Of course not. But if you don't see it, you don't think it. So, I'm starting to assess in her sort of this out of sight, out of mind concept. What other things is your wife paying attention to that she's aware of. What other things, and this gets a little fun, should she be paying attention to that she probably doesn't want to. And now she's thinking, great, thanks therapist. Now you're making me worried about the all the other stuff out there. And my point is to say, maybe, just maybe, the mask is a bit of an overreach. Maybe it can be sometimes modified. And so if someone is completely vigilant about doing said behavior, in this case the mask, and she can't take it off with you with her bow at a restaurant in the corner, I think we have something to work on there. If she's like, "Well, okay, I can do it at least when I'm with Peter." Okay, we've broken some ground. We have some wiggle room there. But often someone has no wiggle room and they're not willing to give up whatever that thing is. And that's where we start talking about doing various interventions. And interventions for this are a combination of addressing cognitive flaws, understanding the behaviors, mental and behavioral, that he or she is doing that are way more pervasive than just the mask, starting to ask them to make minor modifications to those behaviors, which we typically call ritual prevention.

[01:03:06] And then if I get lucky enough, we actually get into a place called exposure therapy. And we haven't talked about at all about that, but a real anxiety therapist, going back to the very first thing I said to you, you're not going to come to my clinic and be seen by an anxiety specialist, no matter what their degree, credential, years of service are, and not get some version of exposure therapy. And all exposure therapy is is an intervention that helps someone approximate their fear, facing it head-on in a safe, ethical, compassionate way without putting them in any ethical, legal, or medical risk.

[01:03:40] Some people might think it puts them at risk and some people might think they can't handle it. But exposure therapy, which goes back to the 60s, is the leading intervention for things like PTSD, phobias, social anxiety, OCD, and health anxiety. But to get someone to get there means you have to get them across this process of readiness for change. This this model of pre-contemplation to contemplation to ready to take action. If your wife is like, I am never going to take off this mask. She is so pre-contemplation.

[01:04:07] I've got to figure out then what concessions or changes can she make? Maybe her and Peter go to a cafe or restaurant outside that's completely airrated, not inside. And she tries to take off the mask even for 5 minutes. And if she can do that, Peter, we're breaking ground. We're now putting some wiggle room between a dogmatic um uh anxolytic noway wiggle room action and now as long as it's outside air and when the waiter comes over, she puts it back on her face. Okay, I'm okay with that.

[01:04:34] But now you get to see her beautiful face. you guys can eat outside and now you're going to start picking cafes that are outside more than inside restaurants to slowly start building some resistance or strength bravery for her to try it in different locations. And if she does it and get sick the next day, you're going to fire me and hate me. But if she doesn't, then maybe we're starting to break around and find other things that she can modify or change slowly that meets her pace and that makes you happy.

[01:04:58] That's all good anxiety therapist is going to So is the idea that you use cognitive behavioral therapy to bridge the gap until they're ready for exposure therapy? Sometimes sometimes if someone's so precontemplation or so wedded in their rituals and we see people who are literally scrubbing walls with Lysol and bleach where the walls are down to the studs. That's more for things like contamination based OCD. People are doing behaviors that require almost hospital level care. Some of them are not ready for exposure-based therapy.

[01:05:24] And in that case, I'd probably recommend someone if they're not on medication probably seriously consider medication. But exposure therapy is the first line treatment for almost everything to do with OCD and health anxiety. Once you get them ready for the exposure, you have to um you can say that once you get them ready, but I'm never walking into a a client with OC or health anxiety not thinking I'm not going to do exposure therapy. They're going to be getting it some version. So if I came to you and said, um, but I'm an I'm an exposure therapist.

[01:05:51] Okay. So So I don't know if this is a realistic enough example. So I'm going to So if it's not, just say, Peter, that's not how these people present. So, let's say I said, um, Josh, I, um, you know, I travel a lot for work, but, um, I got to tell you, with all this news around, um, air traffic controllers going, you know, uh, losing sight of airplanes, I don't know if I can fly anymore. This has now actually posed a real risk to my career. My career depends on me being able to get on a plane every week to go and meet my uh, my clients or whatever it is I do. This is a real world scenario, by the way.

[01:06:26] There are people that are having increases in aerophobia or fear of flying way more than we had in the last few years because of stuff that's going on. This is this is real stuff. So So yeah, so the environmental trigger is there has been a rash of airplane crashes coupled with objective data that say air traffic controllers are overworked and the system is failing and something bad is going to happen.

[01:06:47] And unfortunately my job necessitates that I'm on the road, you know, all the time and I can't take buses. It's too far. I can't take trains. Basically, I'm going to lose my job if I'm not willing to get on a plane every Monday and come back every Thursday and I can't seem I just don't know how to do it. And I've got two I got two weeks of PTO. I'm going to do a little bit of medical leave, but I'm running out of options.

[01:07:11] How the hell are you going to get me on a plane? So, first of all, that person is trying to figure out values. They're trying to figure out what's more important, the belief that I'm going to die in a plane crash versus my job and my livelihood. And they're in the trenches in that. So, I want to join them there. Before we do anything, I'm going to do an assessment. We're going to have that first meeting or two. I'm trying to figure out

[01:07:29] Tell me a bit about the assessment. You mentioned this earlier. Yep. Yep. So, almost any therapist is going to do an initial intake evaluation, which is gathering a lot of information that they have filled out in advance, going through that, and then interviewing them for usually between 60 to 90 minutes to really better understand their story, what they're coming into treatment for, what their history of treatment is. in situations like this, you know, have they had other moments of fear of flying, fear of driving, other significant avoidant behaviors? Ultimately, the goal of an intake evaluation, a first meeting, is trying to figure out diagnostically what's going on. And so once you know what that diagnosis is, treatment commences from there. So by the end of a first meeting, a first intake, they have filled out generic survey forms, um some forms that we would describe as evidence-based assessments that have been demonstrated in research to be the best for specificity and sensitivity of getting to symptoms of a diagnosis. And in each sub disorder, depression, social anxiety, OCD, there's everyone sort of has their tried and true that are research grade that we all sort of know are standard in the field. Um, and someone's going to fill those out, fill out some general packets about their life and medical history. And I'm going to meet with them to try and help understand their story to try and build rapport to try and connect with them because ultimately I want to have them, you know, run through that brick wall with me at some point in therapy. For this person, it'll eventually be getting back into flying. Is that five sessions or 50 sessions? I don't know right away.

[01:08:47] And it's based on a lot of factors. But in the first meeting or two, I'm gathering a lot of raw data to put together a story, which we would call a case formulation that explains their diagnosis or diagnoses and tell them what the treatment options are. And in a case like this, more likely, Peter, someone's probably going to come in saying, "Do you prescribe benzo?" And I don't prescribe. And honestly, if they have to get in a flight right away, and they don't want to mess up travel and

[01:09:11] PTO, I'm not a fan of medication in general, though I know it helps people and it definitely saves lives. I'm definitely not a fan of medication that has a high addiction potential, but sadly when it comes to things like panic attacks or not being able to get in an airplane and if you're not obviously here or she's probably not going to drive 24 hours or you know 12 hours across the across the country then unfortunately what people usually do is they drink heavily or take benzo to get at least through the flight and what happens on the other side they're now inebriated. So they got through the flight by white knuckling it and getting under the influence but now they can barely get off the plane. That's not a great solution, but it does end up being what people often do with fear of flying because that's the only way they can get through that flight to get through TSA and to get in the plane is going to be some sort of pharmacological whether it's alcohol or pills or a combination.

[01:09:54] So, but that's not my goal. What about alternative medications? So, so what about SSRIs or SNRIs, which again have this sort of sort of bad rap as being anti-depressants, although they're they're probably a much broader category than that. Do medications like that have a role in at least being part of the uh part of the tip of the spear to to to to create some increase in psychological resilience in a story like this to be blunt probably not if the story is that this person has never really seen a therapist before has never really struggled with things like anxiety or depression have never taken medication and this is an end of one kind of situation where they're like, "Yeah, I'm terrified of flying and it's ruining my life." An SSRI is going to take or an SNRI is going to take several weeks to take action. Um, it's not ultimately going to most um I'm trying to be careful not speaking out of turn as as a PhD. I don't usually speak speak too much about medication, but I'm speaking the way almost anyone would who knows about it knows. SSRIs don't treat the the tip of the peak of anxiety. So, someone who's having a panic attack,

[01:11:00] SSRIs, if they've been on them for six months, doesn't help with the panic attack. It can help long-term reduce chronic anxiety which itself can reduce panic attacks. But if you're in the throws of a a panic episode, which is what often fear flyers experience, an SSRI in that moment acutely does not solve.

[01:11:17] Does it help you as a therapist by increasing the sort of emotional resilience that then makes them more open to therapy? If if this is just about fear flying in this unique situation, probably not again. But if someone has a multitude of symptoms and problem areas, and this has been going on for a while. So if this gentleman's missed a few meetings because he doesn't love public speaking, he has to sit around a table and present stuff and he doesn't love going to parties because he just doesn't do well unless he drinks at parties. Um, and he's kind of, you know, become a little bit more of a recluse recently socially in the last few years. Maybe because of medical issues or health issues or he just he's just in a funk of life. Oh, there's also this flying issue. I think an SSRI in the situation might be a good thing to at least help calm some of the things that we're talking about. You know, we're talking about basically an increase in serotonin availability in the brain. An SSRI could be helpful here, but but it's really just a medication for us to actually get to the real tools. I want to teach him because if this is much more of a long-standing issue, an SSRI might help him, but I want to teach him skills where he can basically have his own tools, his own skills, where long-term he's both off the SSRI and doesn't need a therapist anymore. But in this flying situation, honestly, if I was involving a medical person, I'd probably recommend nothing more than a benzo, which I'm not here supporting or in love with. But that's more likely to get someone in that immediate moment through TSA on the other side a benzo because you have to get on a plane on Monday and it's Thursday and you're going to lose your job. So, I need a band-aid and it's going to be a very, very, very tiny dose of Xanax such that it just gets you on the plane and not freaking out, but that's it. Now, let's talk about what your ongoing CBT exposure therapy is to get him, let's say, 6 months from now to be feeling like his old self.

[01:13:02] Yeah. So, fear of flying is an interesting one because it is so in in a unique way a hard one to ultimately do the real exposures with because you don't have a flight simulator. Well, I used to um I so I worked for six years in a virtual reality company that actually pioneered um virtual reality uh interventions for fear of flying, fear of public speaking, fear of heights.

[01:13:24] Yeah. Yeah. Um in the in the 2000s after graduate school and I was on faculty at university in Atlanta for a few years. I'm still adjunct there. I left uh research and clinical career working in a hospital um to then work for a startup and worked in a private practice who actually had fear of flying simulators that had virtual reality goggles um a a platform that would vibrate um an old factory system. You could click buttons and make the smell of smell of you know diesel fuel and like a stinky ham sandwich next to you and perfume. A full sensory experience to have that sort of suffocating horrible fear-f experience.

[01:13:56] But again, there's a few clinics around the country. There's not many that still use these kind of things. It's kind of a a clunky system. So most of us who treat fear of flying don't have access to simulators and those kind of things. Um and prior to 911 many people would actually take short flights with their clients and patients because you could afford it and do like a in Atlanta I could fly to Savannah and back in in an afternoon and it wasn't very costly.

[01:14:15] Today it's almost impossible shy of me going to the airport maybe getting up to TSA having the person buy a plane ticket that's refundable to go through TSA to sit by the terminal to then leave the leave the airport and then get their money back. That's probably the closest real world exposure. But what we're doing is we're addressing all the cognitive distortions or the faulty thinking, faulty logic associated with the fears of flying. I have a 30 tip handout that I often give people about understanding what flights are like.

[01:14:43] That air pockets in the flights are not real things. So people feel things and that the wings can go in each direction when we see wings sort of wobbling. They can go almost 7 feet in each direction. So 14 ft worth worth of movements. When you see the wing doing this, it's not breaking off. Um, and that there's all these mechanisms in place when the pilots are flying to keep things safe, that flight's going one direction at a certain altitude and flights going the other direction at a different altitudes. They don't have head-on collisions in air. Basic facts to teach people stuff that sometimes helps people, but for the most part, it's just how much I'm sorry to interrupt. How much is their fear based on facts that your sheet is addressing? Sometimes, in other words, like, yeah, does am I in this fictional situation, am I afraid of a mid-air collision? Am I afraid of the landing because the air traffic controller loses us? Am I afraid of something as vague as turbulence because

[01:15:34] I don't understand what turbulence is? It's almost none of those. Honestly, the most common aspect of fear flying is having a full-on panic attack on the flight inside of a metal tube that you can't get out. That you can't get out of. Ironically though, see people have a fear of dying and a fear of crashing and a fear of midair collisions. What they're really afraid of is having that feeling of losing their mind on the plane and that they're stuck on it. And so yes, there are some real elements of teaching people the basics and but you can't you can't they're they're correct in that assessment by the way.

[01:16:05] Yes. Yes. But so but then the treatment gets focused much more on panic disorder. So when we're treating fear of flying, you're almost inevitably treating panic disorder which again by the way highly responsive to exposure therapy. In fact, the leading intervention for panic disorder unless you go back to my scenario where you have to give someone a benzo, which I don't prescribe in those acute moments just to get through a singular moment.

[01:16:25] And usually if a psychiatrist would prescribe that, they wouldn't have them take their first dose on the flight. You'd usually try that as you pointed out Xanax, a low dose of Xanax, like a few days before just to see how your body responds. That would be a pretty standard medical care practice thing. Um but when we're treating these kind of conditions like panic disorder, something called introsceptive exposure or treating someone to their intraceptives or bodily sensations is of all the things out there like the undeniable grand champion of interventions. It is super effective. It is highly compassionate. It is not hard to learn as a therapist and it teaches someone that they are not having to respond to these bodily sensations that they think are going to lead to a full-on panic attack. So it would be very rare for me to be treating a fear of flying, a fear of being in a car, a fear of being in sort of situations by also not treating some version of a fear of panic reaction where you feel like you're going to lose your mind, you're going to hyperventilate, you're going to pass out. That pretty much goes along with it. Whether you diagnose both conditions, panic disorder and fear of flying, the DSM would say you wouldn't.

[01:17:28] But in this situation, I'm treating both situations. And so I'm sorry, I misunderstood. How what is the exposure therapy for that specifically? So let's let's step back. Exposure therapy again is one of usually four techniques. One of them is called invivo exposure and that is Latin for in life meaning you're actually doing real things with real objects. If I had a fear of podcasting and public speaking coming in here would be a great invivo exposure. Um there's something called imaginal exposure. Imaginal exposure is actually writing a narrative down or a story which sometimes we do it with trauma. Sometimes we do with imaginal situations that have never happened. So those are two different kinds of imaginal exposure, but you're essentially coming up with a story that you're going to write down and record and listen to. So this is just the first part of exposure therapy as I'm describing. There's a second part that's even more important to me. Um the third kind of exposure is interosceptive exposure and that's commonly used for people who have health anxiety, physical symptoms, or panic disorder. And in this case, we're actually inducing real low-grade physical symptoms like eye blurriness, rapid breathing, sweating, tummy aches, um arm soreness. If you and

[01:18:35] I sit here and do a two-minute plank, my arms are going to be wobbly. So, I'm inducing things that people experience in the real world that immediately make them freak out, think they're having a panic attack, they're having you're saying if somebody is worried about eye blurriness, you're gonna put eye drops in their eye.

[01:18:49] I'm not gonna put eye drops in their eyes. We're probably going to look at an iPad that has these sort of cool visuals that's going to make their eyes there's all these optical illusions I like to use. What about the What about the tummy aches? How do you induce that? You have someone spin in a chair. You have someone um you have someone sort of do some cardiovascular exercise in your office like sitting up and down. Sitting up and down very quickly. Um you have someone spin on a baseball bat. Creating nauseiness, nauseous nauseousness and queasiness is not hard to induce. We're not having someone eat something or ingest something because that's going I think one step further than you need to.

[01:19:19] But you can create any sort of physical symptom from leg soreness to a headache kind of symptom to a tummy ache to tight shoulders to cotton mouth. People who have a fear fear of swallowing um who have like draw, you know, fear of like something getting clogged in their throat. You can recreate almost any physical, not medical, physical symptom safely. If you and I were to go on a treadmill and work out, we're going to create 95% of the symptoms that people experience when they have a panic attack. If you go to a really high level of a treadmill or an elliptical, I'm going to create all those symptoms. But

[01:19:48] I'm not going to bring exercise equipment to my office. So I am helping people bring real world physical symptoms to light and in my safe laboratory in a safe place. And I'll get to the second part of the port point of exposure in a second just so they can experience a thing that they're terrified to experience but they already experience it out there. Nothing we do in exposure therapy have they not already experienced. The fourth kind is just called media augmented or virtual reality exposure therapy. and is that people who are using either 3D goggles, virtuality goggles, videos, audio audio clips um to use sort of AV audio visual tools that are kind of mimicking the invivo and imaginal and intraceptive experience and that can be something as elaborate as real world simulators, virtual ready goggles, um or even like watching, you know, a flight land on

[01:20:36] YouTube 20 times in a row to see what happens when the flight comes down. All those things we treat people who have um audio and tactile things like misophonia which is a high sensitivity to sounds or people who are afraid of hearing something. So anything that brings that that tool into the place using audio video that's part one of exposure therapy which is you and a patient have come up with an elaborate hierarchy ladder a list of easy medium and hard scenarios in their mind that they think that they could some point do. Most people think they can never do the hard ones and they almost always do successfully. Um, and you're coming up with this hierarchy based on what you asked about that first meeting, that first session, that second session. I'm collecting a lot of raw data to figure out what are the things in their life that are triggering them that I can recreate to help them face their fears headon and come up with new learning.

[01:21:30] And so, Peter, back in the 60s and 70s, we thought that habituation or just getting used to it was the creme de la creme of exposure therapy. And we found out that that wasn't really solving it. And then we started shifting more towards cognitive models that not not just habituation and being in a distressed moment, but actually now coming up with new meaning about it, which is called inhibitory learning.

[01:21:50] That was really started at a seminal article in 1986 by um Michael Kak and Ednafo. NFO is one of the pioneers of exposure therapy both in PTSD and OCD and um has done amazing work out of UPEN. Um her um Marty Franklin a bunch of people at the UPEN sort of were the pioneers of exposure therapy. In '86 they they pioneered an article that taught us that habituation or just getting used to symptoms. It helps but it's not really getting people moving further. And so when you start having these corrective experiences, when you start unlearning what you thought was going to happen, which anxiety is all about anticipating something and being colossally wrong, thank God, we need to get people to experience being wrong in a situation that mimics what they actually experience. So exposure therapy has shifted from just a behavioral physiological model to a cognitive model. And that cognitive model is helping people process that information after the exposure. So, you just did some weird stuff for 20 to 45 minutes.

[01:22:47] Whether you're huffing and puffing, practicing giving a speech to a screen, um, putting yucky things on your hands if you have OCD, uh, germ OCD, um, if you're afraid of, you know, bugs and spiders, you know, maybe going to a local pet shop and looking at spiders behind a glass tank or putting, you know, spiders that are in like resin, fake spiders that are dead, like on your arms. all sorts of things that start whatever it is that you can create that sense of fight, flight or freeze, that sense of fear, that sense of dread. So your amydala starts producing the chemicals that you experience in your own life in my private safe place.

[01:23:21] Sometimes we go out in the community, we go to restaurants and shops and do odd weird things. And so we're doing that to have people experience that stuff, but also not engage in rituals and compulsions. So exposure therapy is a combination of doing things that bring on a sense of safe, predictable, but uncomfortable emotional, physical feelings while also not doing the mental and behavioral things that bring it back down. And if you can stay in that state for 30 to 45 minutes and do that multiple times a week, Peter, you start learning real distress tolerance, real resiliency skills. you start disproving that the thing that I thought I had to do either to avoid it altogether or to undo this sense of dread or feeling if I don't undo that and I sit with it maybe just maybe when it happens in the real world I don't have to pop a pill I don't have to run home I don't have to wash my hands I don't have to wear the mask and so we're combining inducing a sense of um arousal psychophysiological arousal cognitive interpretations that are usually faulty not doing things to bring it down and stay with that. Doing a few different interactive things through 30 to 45minut experiences and then afterwards processing those lessons learned. Making meaning out of these weird situations, finding out that you're stronger than you thought you were. Finding out that no one died.

[01:24:44] Finding out that in that moment you didn't do that horrible thing you were wondering if you were going to do. Again, we're treating things like people are afraid of being pedophiles. People are afraid of getting horrible diseases. People afraid of killing themselves or killing other people. People afraid of contaminating things and and ruining someone down the road. Some things are imminent and some things are you won't know for a few years from now. And so we're really tapping into this intolerance of uncertainty. This belief that I can't deal with the fact that something terrible is going to happen.

[01:25:09] So I've created this fabricated world around me wearing the mask to make sure it doesn't happen. Sorry. You gave an interesting example there. You said people have a fear of being a pedophile. Yes. Okay. This is very controversial. Yeah. Yeah, I was about to say, is this a person? So, let's just posit that this is a person who's never acted out any such

[01:25:28] Absolutely. Do they fantasize about pedophilia? Um, not fantasize, but they have thoughts and feelings about it. Just like you and I have thoughts and feelings about driving off the bridge. Thoughts and feelings of robbing a bank. I mean, I every time I see an armored char armored truck, I'm thinking that'd be fun to take those $4 million, but what do I do? Move on with my day. So, everyone has intrusive thoughts. 99.9% of us have thoughts about sex, drugs, rock and roll, horrible things. And for most of us, wait, those things are bad.

[01:25:56] Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, depends on the depends on the band. Um, for most for 90 93 to 94% of the population, so there's about, you know, 4 to 6% of the population that battles OCD, they just teflon right off of us. A thought about like, you know, punching someone at a restaurant. I have the thought stabbing them in the eye and moving on. Road rage, I have a thought of, you know, tailing that person and doing something back to them and I just move on. But for the person who has OCD, that thought doesn't go away so easily. And then they start thinking about it and then they start wondering about it. And again, if

[01:26:26] I start making you think about your left pinky toe, you're going to feel your left pinky toe. If you have these unwanted, intrusive thoughts about a kid or his or her body parts or doing horrible things, guess what's going to get lit up? If we did a brain scan on you, the parts of the brain that regulate sex and arousal. And guess what happens when that part of the brain gets lit up? things down there start getting lit up because your brain's working. So,

[01:26:48] I want to be very clear because I have a few people out in social media, colleagues and dear friends of mine who have been attacked on social media. These are not influencers, though they might be influencers. These are evidence-based, sciencebacked, amazing clinicians who use their advocacy and knowledge for good to help people to destigmatize some really wonderful people out there. And they've been attacked by some creepy people out there saying, "You're endorsing pedophilia."

[01:27:11] Absolutely not. When we talk about OCD in these kind of conditions, we talk about people who have egoonic versus egoistonic experiences. Egoonic is I want to be here on this podcast. I want to be a little bit nervous coming in here because it matters to me. It matters whether you like me. It matters if I sound good. That means this is aligned with my values. I want to put information out there. I want to be a voice of reason and I want to educate your community about all these sort of anxiety conditions. That's aligned with my values. That means it's egoonic both to be nervous but also to want to do well here. I'm okay with that.

[01:27:44] Egoistonic means you're having thoughts and feelings that are not aligned with your values. And so in OCD it's epidemic that the things you're afraid of do not align with your values. Whether it's about hurting someone accidentally because you didn't wash your hands from, you know, the chicken or stabbing someone or killing someone or molesting someone or getting punished by God. Um, there's all sorts of topics that people get really fixated on accidentally and they get terrified by that and they spend time thinking about it because they're trying to get rid of it or doing something about it like not going to the park. But does that mean that an egoistonic person rarely if ever will act on the impulse because it is creating so much internal tension.

[01:28:25] Not only will they not act act on the impulse, they don't even want to talk about it. They don't want to think about it. I I don't want to be gross or offensive here, but I don't care about saying the word pedophilia. Doesn't phase me at all because I don't think about it. It doesn't bother me. To someone who has what's acronymed as

[01:28:39] POCD, pedophilia OCD, they don't even want to hear the word. They don't even want to see it on a checklist. And then how does that differ from a pedophile? A pedophile is completely at peace with the fact that they think about it. Whether they're at peace or not, whether they ever eventually actually hurt a child, they think about it. They're turned on by it. They they want to pursue it. And we're start talking about the difference between ideiation, which is just a a clinical word for thought versus want, intent, and action. And so someone who is a pedophile or someone who wants to hurt someone else, someone who wants to rob a bank, thinks about it, plots it, and whether they're lucky enough to do it or not, robbing a bank, maybe they do, maybe they don't, but they have full intent on it. And maybe they don't have the guts to rob a bank, but they want to. So that's not someone who is that's someone who's aligned with that value. People who have OCD are not aligned with anything associated with hurting other people, wanting to bother other people. In fact, in it's a common knowledge in sort of my my work, those are usually the gentlest and kindest of souls. They're tortured by the notion of having the most impure thoughts.

[01:29:41] Thoughts harm is to help those people understand they're not bad people and that they're not, you know, you want to reinforce you are not going to be acting out on this impulse. Actually, I won't do that. You won't do that. No, cuz that's therapeutic reassurance giving. And so I probably from the very beginning back to the first meeting,

[01:29:59] I'll probably say, I know who you are. I know what's going on here. Welcome home. We have groups. We have podcasts. We have meetings. You're in a safe place. And I know this is not aligned with your values. And I'll probably say to them, this might be the last time in our relationship. If I see you for 15 to 20 sessions, this might be the last time I ever say to you, I know you're not a pedophile or I know you don't want to hurt a kid. And they look at me like, wait, what? Because in therapy and in life, reassurance seeking is one of the most insidious classic symptoms in OCD.

[01:30:27] We see it in health anxiety as well, but reassurance seeking is asking for clarity and for permission and for confession and wanting to get that back. And if a therapist does that, this is for me one of the best litmus tests when I say go find that anxiety specialist. When I find an anxiety specialist, rabbit ears, anxiety specialist does reassurance and says you're going to be fine. I'm sure you don't have cancer.

[01:30:50] I've never said to someone, "I'm sure you don't have cancer." I don't know if you have cancer. I have no idea. So, I'm sure you're not going to have a stroke. You're never going to get Alzheimer's. I'm sure you're not a pedophile. When I hear that from a therapist, they weren't trained by me or someone like me. And you're barking up the wrong tree because now you are weaponizing that certainty principle, which is all the anxiety sufferer wants. I can't promise you're not going to die in a plane crash,

[01:31:11] Peter. And I can't promise if your wife takes off her mask, she's not going to get sick at the restaurant. What I can promise is is if she takes it off, her husband gets to enjoy her more. I can promise if she takes it off, she may be able to do other things that feel risky and scary, but actually add to her life.

[01:31:26] That if she takes it off, maybe she'll have more opportunities. But I can guarantee you if she keeps it on, she's losing her husband, her friendships, her. She's like, I don't care. I just don't want to get sick. Okay. Well, now you're choosing your own values here. And is that exactly where you need to get people? Is that is the risk calculation? There is no risk-free. We don't have the equivalent of a risk-free asset here.

[01:31:45] The only thing I can promise someone in this world is that they're not going to live at some point, which sounds morbid and terrible. I'm I'm actually wearing a bracelet that one of my patients gave me that says, "You're not dead yet. It's the only thing I know in this world is that at some point we're both not going to be here. Between now and that data point, what do you want to do to have the biggest and best life?" But if I sit here and promise them that they're going to be okay and it's going to be I can guarantee you it's 14 sessions. I guarantee you that that that Prozac's going to work for you. I'm selling them a false sense of hope. I hope it works.

[01:32:20] I'm assuming you're not going to molest someone, but that's not my job here. My job is to help you understand what are your values, which I already know what their values are. What are you doing align with them? Trying to not think about stuff and trying to be the best person possible. I already knew that.

[01:32:32] What things are you missing out on because you're so scared that your values could get compromised? I can't go to birthday parties or I can't see my aunt and uncle because of the the niece and nephew or like I okay so how do we start approaching those situations if you believe that you don't want to hurt anyone and you want to approach them what things are going on the inside in your body and your mind that are preventing you from going there how do we start that process and that's when we before we're doing exposure therapy we're trying to figure out how do we start chipping away at some of those rituals some of those avoidant tendencies that you're doing so walk me through that example again this is such a fascinating one that never even crossed my mind as a condition but it also strikes me is if you can fix something like that, you can almost fix anything. So you you said something a second ago about within 14 or you know whatever 15 sessions, I'm never going to once but this first time reassure them.

[01:33:19] Okay. The implication of that to me is you think this person's going to be fine in 6 months potentially. Most likely uh pre- pandemic um I was seeing people pretty consistently 10 to 15 sessions in most research studies for most of the conditions that I treat and that we've discussed today. Again, deviation from the manual a little bit.

[01:33:37] We we like to talk about, you know, how how to customize an intervention for the person, but it's very evidence-based. 10 to 15 sessions, 13 to 16 sessions is pretty standard. Post pandemic, people want to talk about everything. And it's my job to figure out how do we get to the core of what we're working on. I'm seeing people for way more than 15 sessions traditionally now. Don't love that. We never thought I was going to be doing that. But most of my colleagues around the country would agree that we have now elongated the length of therapy, not because we want to, but because people have more stuff they want to unpack, more things they want to discuss.

[01:34:05] When that person leaves your care, whether it's 15 or 20 sessions later, do they have just as many thoughts about children as they did when they came in? So, in general, I find that people have many less of those accidental internal unwanted symptoms in general. But I'm going to say something that might be upsetting to the people listening or the people that I've supported. I don't care. I don't care how many thoughts they do or don't have because you and I are not defined by our thoughts. Y we're not defined by our physiology.

[01:34:36] We're not defined by our hunger cravings or what we think until you say them or act on them. We are judged by our outward objective or when we avoid actions and inactions. And that's why when people were not taking anti-racist actions, I understand why people were judged for that because that's still an action. If you chose not to vote, you voted for whoever won. So all of those principles apply to me. And

[01:35:01] I tell this to my clients. I don't care what you think and feel. I care what you do next. And you're coming to me because what you're doing next is shrinking your life. And I know who you are. and I know what you want, but you're not pursuing that because you're so afraid that that bad thing might happen. And so in any situation, fear of flying, fear of contamination, fear that you might hurt someone, fear that you might have a disease. I know you don't want to die, but all the things you're doing to prevent cancer are costing you financially. You can't see doctors. Your family doesn't want to talk to you. You think you're trying to prevent dying.

[01:35:36] You're dying right now. I call health anxiety the cancer of psychiatry, which is it's what it is to me. It's it's eating you from the inside. It's its own path p pathology. It's it's killing you and spreading to everything around you and you think you're trying to prevent this horrible disease down the road. You spent your career trying to help people elongate now and down the road. I'm trying to help people not eat away what's happening right in front of them.

[01:35:59] And so their value system is missionritical. So now in our discussion here, we're shifting from cognitive behavioral therapy, which was really, I think, the biggest change in the field of psychiatry to help people find evidence-based randomized control trial interventions that are research grade that really help people to the next wave, which is still under cognitive behavioral therapy. When we talk about exposure, now we're talking about ACT, acceptance, and commitment therapy, which CBT historically did not talk about these kind of things like values.

[01:36:31] What do you really want in this world? Who are you on the inside? And so ACT is an extension of doing CBT. And I guess CBT is the umbrella. Exposure therapy is underneath that. And I'd put ACT underneath CBT. ACT pioneered by Steven Hayes and other wonderful researchers and therapists really developed this sort of six construct. They call it the hexoflex. this six construct paradigm that identifies your ability to accept things that are happening inside of you, thoughts and feelings, without it defining who you are.

[01:37:04] Your ability to be present in moments, even if you're having like tooth ache, if you had like a a medical pain right now going on, your ability to be present in the moment, um to be able to use yourself as a self, it's called self-concept. That I'm not defined by my thoughts and feelings. I just have thoughts and feelings. And so we teach people when they have the thought like, "God, what if I kill someone?" Or like, "What if I'm gay?"

[01:37:27] There's something called sexual orientation OCD, which we haven't talked about. Or like, "What if I get cancer?" You can shift that to I'm having the thought, "What if I have cancer? I'm having the thought, what if I kill someone?" You've now created some space between you and your thoughts. That's a powerful skill. And there's a bunch of techniques out there called cognitive diffusion that help people separate themselves from their content of their thought. And now we're looking at thought as a process rather than an object. Peter, very powerful stuff. Um, and within that act hexoflex is values.

[01:38:02] And values are mission critical because for the work that I do with anxiety, for the work that you do in your work, you and I actually kind of have the same goal. We have the goal of people today living their healthiest and richest lives and elongating that as much as possible so when we get to the end, the end doesn't happen as rapidly and as destructively as it sometimes does.

[01:38:25] We're doing the same thing here. But when psychiatry and anxiety come together, values fall apart. People's values become focused on intolerance of uncertainty. I use the word yucky a lot with three-year-olds and 50-year-olds. making yucky go away, not feeling, not thinking. Your value shift to a negative reinforcement process of doing things or not doing things to remove some bad outcome. And your position, and mine is as well, is doing things that increase good outcomes. And so I'm trying to shift people and I have this sheet I use in my office all the time from the right side of the paper doing or not doing to remove some bad thing that's going to happen which is called negative reinforcement to doing or not doing whatever you want that has the not a guarantee but the possibility of increasing your lifespan, increasing your marriage, increasing your sex life, increasing your health, increasing your cardiovascular functioning, increasing your ability to go to the doctor and hear the results. And if you have questions, ask them appropriately. And if you don't believe them, go to one more doctor. And after that, move on with your life if you can because at some point all of the factf finding that you're doing, it's like the worst puzzle ever. I gave you a thousand piece black puzzle with no corners and I took one piece away and I snuck it in my pocket and I just haven't told you that yet.

[01:39:47] And you're trying to solve this puzzle and you're never going to solve it. And your value is solving the puzzle at all cost. I'm not leaving the house. I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to quit my job. I'm not even going to eat until I solve this puzzle. That's not solvable. So your value shifted from doing a puzzle to only solving the puzzle. And the problem is in my work, most my patients can't solve the puzzle. They have to drop the rope and pick a different game. And that's the game of life, values, people, love, health. And um therapy is about getting people to see that shift, that cognitive shift, that paradigm shift from removing uncomfort, removing ambiguity, removing uncertainty to doing things that make your life bigger and better. There's no guarantee for that, but that's a much more exciting life to support someone in than just making symptoms go away. So, I don't care if they stop having thoughts.

[01:40:38] That's ideal, and we often see that with medication and talk therapy. I don't care if they feel less or more. I care that when those insidious and uncomfortable symptoms show up, they choose a healthy action that gives them life. They do that, I'm done seeing them. And I don't care what the topic is. I don't care what the disorder is.

[01:40:55] If they they have the skill of stepping back from their internal symptomatology and choosing a healthy action that increases their world, they're their own therapist. Now again we have talked about this directly and indirectly a couple of times which is the it's been referenced through being present uh directly through mindfulness.

[01:41:18] We've talked repeatedly about the space between stimulus and response. Is mindfulness meditation as a formal practice a part of this therapy with anxiety? Absolutely. So I don't typically treat I I teach breath work or meditation per se, but anyone who has the capacity to cognitively or physiologically be present with themselves and with the world around them and stay in control, it's a winning intervention. So meditation has a place in this.

[01:41:48] Mindfulness has a place in this. Relaxation training has a place in this. If taking a cold plunge or going into a sauna is going to get you to a place of recognition of what your needs and values are in this world, that has a place for it. I I find exercise, even though I'm a therapist who does cognitive behavioral therapy, I'm a pickle ball fanatic. Um, play I can't get enough of it. I find exercise to be the best form of meditation and mindfulness. You can't play or do the sports that some I'm not talking about just like weightlifting or walking on a treadmill at a high level sports. Um, which I'm not a I'm an amateur. I just play pickle ball with people at a local community center, but I like to play pretty intensely. You can't do that and not be both mindful of what's happening around you and in the state of almost euphoria which I view meditation to be.

[01:42:32] And that's why paddle sports are always viewed as some of the best sports for longevity of life, for cognitive functioning, for hand eye coordination, for staying present, and obviously for cardiovascular functioning if you don't break a hip or break a leg, which some people do. Um, I think any of those interventions or activities that increase your sense of awareness, your sense of how your body operates, and that encourage you to do things that are healthy and increase healthy actions, all those have a place in it. As does extracurricular activities, prayer, knitting, clay, drawing, painting, all of those. None of those suck away your life. None of those keep you away from loved ones unless they become an obsession or an addiction in a bad way.

[01:43:13] What are some signs or things that you see in therapy that give you concern that a person is not going to recover? What? And and maybe we start with that that question which is what is the success rate? Um success defined as a person who after some finite number of sessions gets to the point where actions and behaviors are uh remediated independent of thoughts. Yeah, I I'm going to make a statement on that question and I promise you I'll answer it because there's a lot of controversy in the field of psychotherapy research and even in my kind of world of OC and anxiety researchers about what research is and what real outcomes are. I'm a the medical field does not debate this and so I I wish the psychotherapy field of research didn't debate this either. It's not just about when you're doing better after therapy, which I don't think is that hard to achieve. It's doing better after months of no therapy. I know my patients are doing better when I don't hear back from them when they truly become their own therapist. So the best research to me in psychotherapy and the best RCTs, randomized control trials show when there's 6 months, 12 months, 8 months of followup that is demonstrating continued symptom remittance or subdiagnostic um um gain. So, so that the my answer to your question is um when someone, this is funny cuz we're talking about health anxiety, when someone is therapist shopping, we don't usually call it doctor shopping, it would be therapist shopping. When they've been to five to seven therapist in a short amount of time, that scares me because what that tells me is they're looking for a certain answer or a certain kind of therapist and no therapist is matching their needs. And that's no different than finding a romantic partner. When someone has been through multiple partners in a short amount of time, there the consistency in that that concerns me. When someone is a yeah, but in therapy, that really scares me because again, that means that they know all the answers and they're they're struggling with what we call cognitive flexibility. And in acceptance and commitment therapy and in CBT, cognitive flexibility is mission critical.

[01:45:11] Unfortunately, I'm going to be teaching you, this goes back to the FOA and Kak 1986 article about corrective information, that maybe you're wrong. And when someone is characterologically unwilling to be wrong, you're not going to do well in therapy. It's just a fact. And you figure that out how soon?

[01:45:28] Within the first two or three sessions. I think most therapists have a general sense. And I would say in the first two or three dates, someone knows whether there's an attraction here. I think in the first two or three sessions, most therapists know whether or not there's some wiggle room in here. And I um to be fair, I'm in a 25 team practice. We have therapists in three states, Georgia mostly, and we see people in 40 states.

[01:45:48] Okay? So, we're a mega practice in the state of where my career is at. I'm very privileged to say this. I'm very appreciative I can say this. I see the sickest of sickest. That's what turns me on intellectually. It's what gets me going. Um I could treat a dog phobia. We treat that. I could treat someone who's having um you know weird eating issues.

[01:46:06] I can treat panic attacks. I did that years ago. So I'm seeing people who are very ill who have been to hospitals who have failed um medication trials um who are who have tried TMS and ketamine. I'm seeing very ill people. And I'm not perfect at I'm not getting 100% results here, but I'm seeing people who think that they have no chance to get better, but they want to and they're desperate for information and they're desperate for someone who can see them and understand what's going on. And so my success rate is probably not better than the other people I saw that were are easier to treat, but I'm seeing people who shouldn't be getting better and they still get better. But it's because they want it. They're willing and they're trying everything they can even if they're stubborn, even if they're hopeless, even if they're not doing well. So for me, I don't know if I'd use the word characterological, but there are these sort of intrinsic cognitive states that people are in where they just can't see anything but what's in front of them. And if I can't push them beyond that, I'm going to be the next therapist that they fire and I'm aware of that. When people are open and willing to new ideas to weird interventions, if someone's never had exposure therapy, I see plenty of people who have been to multiple therapists who've never even had exposure therapy.

[01:47:12] And to me, that's like you treating someone for, I don't know, what medical condition and not giving them, you know, some cholesterol medication. Well, that's like that's the no-brainer. I see people who have a condition that the only intervention they should get is some version at least of cognitive behavioral therapy and they haven't had that. They're seeing a supportive therapist or an analyst or they're doing soft therapy. And I'm like, I it blows my mind. So when I see someone who is not willing to hear my ideas, when I see someone who when I share with them videos or clips, they're not willing to watch them. I'm watching that resistance play out and I'm like, how do I connect with them? Another major factor and this has been proven in psychotherapy research across psychotherapies is the in between session experience. So your sessions are weekly typically or typically typ typically weekly. Most most I see most people weekly. Um, when

[01:48:01] I'm seeing someone that's needs a high level of care, sometimes I'm seeing two or three times a week. We again we have an intensive outpatient program where I don't manage or run see patients that I have a staff that does that. Um, but typically weekly and there are in session interventions, things I'm doing with the person, funny moments we have, light bulb moments and techniques we practice. And then I don't like to use the word homework, but then there's homework. The research is undeniable in a homework-driven structured kind of therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness-based CBT, all the interventions that that utilize skills between sessions. This is no different than working out with a trainer. If you go with a trainer and don't work out for the rest of the week, guess what happens in week two? You've gained nothing. If you practiced with your golf instructor in week one and you did no practicing in the on the course between the next appointment, your stroke's not going to be any better. And psychotherapy research is no different. If you're not doing the assignments between sessions, you're not learning and messing up. I love when people mess up their assignments. I don't care if they do them right. I just care they try them because if they mess up, guess what I get to do? Correct information. So, this is all about learning and messing up.

[01:49:11] Learning and messing up and learning from that and building from that. So that's another kind of critical ingredient when I see someone when they ask like what did you guys do between sessions like nothing. What did they ask you? What did they assign you? I really didn't I didn't do it or I didn't like what they gave me. I'm like oh okay am I going to give them the right assignment or are they just going to block me as well? So I follow that under again more cognitive inflexibility or they think they know the right way. But interventions between sessions is where we gain mastery of skills and then they come back and I refine them and we practice them and then they practice them and I come back and that in between stuff is is actually pretty important.

[01:49:44] And when someone doesn't do work between sessions if there's work to be done the my I'm having groundhog day. I'm having the session of like well let's talk about we talked about last time and what got in the way and did I not assign it right? Did you not understand it? and we're having a little bit of playback which kind of can be defeating in therapy when you you think you know what's best for them and sometimes we're wrong and then you try something else but if they're not trying it I can't learn from their mistakes. Does anxiety whether it be health anxiety or any of the the subsets that we've talked about today does it tend to to to traffic with other uh coorbidities either health coorbidities directly or more importantly psychiatric coorbidities?

[01:50:23] Yep. So again, I said earlier, one of the most common symptoms in anxiety, it's really the most common is avoidance. So it's not shocking that we see um lowgrade. We don't we're not a substance abuse specialty clinic, but we see people dabbling in alcohol and marijuana use and and opiates and stimulants to feel better. So you'll see pretty common co-occurrence of substance related usage, maybe not full-on abuse.

[01:50:48] And the causality there Josh you think is I am finding I am using the substance to medicate the anxiety or is it the other way around? Both it's probably birectional but but there's definitely an element of I'm I'm self-medicating because I don't want to deal with my stuff that's not shocking to most of us. And so especially if we're doing exposure therapy having someone who is muting their anxiety response who's muting their sympathetic parasympathetic activation. If I can't tap into that to have their amydala and liyic region light up if I was doing brain imaging to then have them feel that to then teach them some corrections. If I can't tap into that cuz they're numbed out, I can't make those changes. So that's that's one sub area. I want to dig into that a bit more. How do you manage that then? So, when you when you get under the hood of somebody who's coming to see you and you realize actually they're kind of high every day, not with you, let's just assume that they come in and they're not, but but they're basically using marijuana every single day or that, you know, they're using alcohol or whatever it is. Um, how do you manage that? Do you say, "Listen, I can't really help you until we get you off this because I need to experience you in your uh your native state." How do you sometimes sometimes it's a black and white if you're at this level of usage even if it's not you know impairing their lives completely I may not be the right therapist for you. Um but I come from a harm reduction model. I've I've worked in abstinenceonly models and I'm a believer that if we can reduce this and get into a moderate state of whatever it is you're using as a starting point. This is the concept of working out the hierarchy of exposure therapy. I can't ask them just to quit.

[01:52:18] Like that's not even a that's not even a concept to me. So we're taking baby steps if someone's willing to make a concession. What if they say, "But but doctor, listen. I I I have to use this is actually helping me." Let's just No one's probably going to actually say that on alcohol because I think deep down Yes. They'll say it on benzo and they'll say it on marijuana. They're saying, "You don't understand. This isn't anxolytic. This is actually reducing my anxiety. We shouldn't be cutting this back." I've seen patients who use weed chronically but are functioning in most areas of their life in general, occupationally, their partner smokes with them or their partner doesn't care, but they're coming in with anxiety issues. It can create a real dilemma. Mhm.

[01:52:52] Um, I need pockets of time where they're not just always feeling, I'm not going to say good, numb. So, I I want them to feel distress in small doses. I want them to have these hiccups where they can where they can feel and have differentiation. Ultimately, the the the short answer is is if someone is wedded to using a substance and it's just going to get in the way of my work, I will probably refer them to someone who's more likely to work with them. I don't know who that person is sometimes because most therapists don't want to work with someone who is chronically using a substance that's causing impairment and they're not willing to give it up. And if they're not willing to go for treatment for that, then we have a different issue. I think more often what I'm finding is I'm like, "Okay, so the first three sessions I'm going to discuss this, I'm going to bring it up. I'm going to ask if there's any way for us to change it and to see again if there's any wiggle room, there's any flexibility in there to make changes in anywhere of your life. Can we just give it up on Tuesdays? Can you just make sure you don't smell like weed when you walk into my office in Georgia?

[01:53:43] It's not legal, but people still smoke it, you know, like everywhere else. Um, so, um, but you know, if you're smoking and driving, that's DUI. That's DWI. That concerns me. So, in general, I'm in a harm reduction model. I'm like, how can we do things that bring less harm to your life and open up your life more? If someone is wedded to anything in their life that I find to be destructive, and

[01:54:03] I think it's going to get in the way of our therapy, I'm not the right therapist for them. Having said that, there's again an interesting sub area of research in the exposure literature for which exposure therapists who get really literal and very dogmatic won't do exposures for people who are under the influence. They won't do exposures on the day where someone's taking a benzo.

[01:54:21] And so in a lot of exposure research again if you think about PTSD populations Peter where where polyfarm pharmacy is honestly usually the the the baseline where people are taking sometimes an SSRI one or two benzo one long acting one short acting maybe a stimulant and maybe even a low dose you know a antiscychotic you're doing a research study if someone is taking a benzo on the day of exposure you can't tap into the things we're trying to tap into into that bulb of the amydala that bulb of of emotional centeredness to have that lit up so we can have some corrective experiences. So you'll see in research studies whether people noted people were not allowed to take benzo on the day of exposures. Um and so that becomes a challenge when I'm doing anxiety work and someone's doing something. I don't view it as a legal or ethical issue but it's muting my ability to tap into real presence. Talk about presence.

[01:55:11] I'm I may not be the right therapist and maybe that's really the message, right? It's not a judgment. It's simply an efficacy question. It's just that I can't I can't actually help you. What you want from me and what I'm able to offer you is attenuated by the fact that we're not going to remember this conversation the same way. That's not good for us.

[01:55:29] Uh the question about coorbidity, ADHD, or I'll say attention issues is pervasive. And we see lots of kids in our clinic, but um I I can't even tell you the chicken and egg of do you have ADHD or anxiety or both or neither half the time. And even the best diagnostic diagnosticians can't tell you because if you have pervasive intrusive thoughts,

[01:55:50] Peter, how the heck are you not constantly interrupted in your prefrontal cortex? How if you're thinking about raping and killing or health or disease or dying or morbid topics, how can you possibly be attending to all the things in the room? And so people who have anxiety have these attentional biases and disruptions.

[01:56:09] OCD and health anxiety related conditions do have a you know the research is we don't know all the mechanisms but there's a breakdown between executive function operation and the emotional or liyic region like there's a there's a breakdown there there's a disruption there and so attention is pervasive in the OCD community we're seeing higher rates of co-occurrence of autism and OCD is pretty common um and then when you get into the molecularity of OCD we see a lot of people that have kind of these interesting areas like ticks body focus repetitive behavior something called trickotillamania which is hair pulling of different parts of your body or dermatillamania which is skin picking.

[01:56:42] Um and so we see co-occurrences of ticks. Um tricketamania and dermatillamania are called body focused repetitive behaviors. So they're called BFRBs. So ticks, BFRBs, um um medical issues, a lot of cocurrens of like chronic medical issues like IBS, restless leg syndrome with people that have chronic anxiety, ADHD, autism. I mean it's really a little bit of everything. So in an anxiety center like

[01:57:04] I said we all sort of at the centrifuge of it all all treat the primary nine anxiety disorders and then all of us dabble in some do autism some do ADHD some are doing more mood disorders some are doing a lot of regular relationship and emotional dysregulation stuff but um you have to know the science and molecularity of anxiety to understand that and if you're not the right person to treat that we'll make a referral out or a referral within our team. What do you think is the biggest myth about health anxiety?

[01:57:32] That that someone's making it up, that someone's looking for attention, that there's secondary gain. Um, it is disheartening and sad to see a medical professional or a loved one tell the person that they're just drug seeking or seeking attention. I I know that's the case on an occasion, but nobody wants to have I'll say OCD as well. Nobody wants to have OCD or health anxiety. It is not functional. It is not fun. It is not enjoyable. It is not adaptive. And when someone says, "Oh, my OCD helps me like be better at work," that's not OCD.

[01:58:04] You're talking about something else there. Whether we're talking about perfectionism or OCPD, obsessivempulsive personality disorder, or something else, there is not an ounce of functionality with OCD in anyone who I've worked with, anyone who I care for, all my social media friends that are out there that are on Instagram and Tik Tok who are amazing humans destigmatizing these conditions.

[01:58:23] No one believes that OCD has any adaptive healthy aspects to it. Health anxiety for me is terrible because um you and I are in in different different professions, but we're trying to help people live their best quality of lives, live their fullest lives. And it breaks my heart when I see someone who has health anxiety, who is convinced, and

[01:58:41] I'm not talking like they're wondering, they're convinced that there's something wrong despite my loving, compassionate guidance, five to seven doctors who have told them they're crazy, which is what they end up hearing, or go to the ER or go see a shrink. That's the message they get. They are 100% cintonic convinced that there's something wrong with them.

[01:59:01] And it's absolutely heartbreaking to see that. And until you can get them to shift that needle and be a little more flexible, they're stuck and they are losing their quality of life. And the thing they're trying to preserve is the exact same thing they're killing. So I think that sort of sense of I'm making it up. I'm fabricating it. I'm looking for attention or I'm just looking for drugs is just not the case. And I know again anecdotally, I'm sure it's out there. We all know that. But these people don't want to be this way. They don't want to be seeing doctors. They don't want needles. They don't want, you know, all the exams they go through. But they're willing to do it. I I I've written about this in I put out a book a year and a half ago that's in our book.

[01:59:37] Um I have a a health anxiety online platform that people come to for support groups and information and cool challenges and weird stuff that that's all out there. And we hear this unfortunate story all the time. I'd rather just have cancer. I'd rather have my arm amputated because I I think I have I think I have an osteocaroma in here. I I'd rather just have that nerve nerve clipped. I'd actually rather be paralyzed so I don't feel my leg pain anymore. And you're thinking, did you just say that? You'd rather have finality of impairment or disease that every physician has told you you don't have rather than a different approach that I'm trying to offer you. And whether that's some medication and talk therapy or something else, you'd rather be impaired or a quadriplegic or have the diagnosis of cancer that you don't have just so you stop worrying about it.

[02:00:26] Like wow. Like that's that's another level of willingness to, you know, get answers. And that's how insidious and how disgusting and how horrible these sticky tricky conditions are, which I'm mostly referring to OCD and health anxiety. They have these thoughts and belief systems that are so entrenched and so believable and it's the biggest ruse in the world. And if I can get them to hear that, if I can get them to realize that maybe if we can drop the rope and and come back and try a different way, maybe just maybe trying to figure out whether you have cancer or not is not the most important thing you do today. Do you have a sense of what the prevalence is today of people that are as ill as you just described?

[02:01:03] EPI research in the last 10-15 years is pretty consistent. about 4 to 8% of the population has some version of health anxiety in their life. um of people who have chronic illnesses a third over 30% of people who have chronic illnesses um Crohn's cancer diabetes cickle cell etc over a third have some version of health anxiety most studies I've read and I've gone through and when I report this and share this about 20 to 30% of us have consistently some subclinical health anxiety notable preoccupations as we get older it obviously increases because we have more health and medical issues.

[02:01:44] And there was an interesting um uh Swedish I think Swedish study that came out um a year or two ago and then a 2024 big study post pandemic that health anxiety has skyrocketed in the last four years just because of whatever the pandemic has done to the world and people's hyperfocus on stuff. So the level of people that I see um I think in the OCD and health anxiety community if we're saying that 6 to8% of the population has OCD or health anxiety probably over a third of them are at that severity level where you start wondering about insight you start wondering about their ability to reality test and that's why medication in this case Peter I think is usually pretty fundamentally critical it is pretty rare for me to see someone with severe OCD or health anxiety who does not benefit from or who would not benefit from an SSRI or an SNRI of some kind. And often you'll see psychiatrists add a low dose of an atypical antiscychotic for a lot of mood instability.

[02:02:40] Thorazine or um Cyprea, Cerakquil. Yeah. Um thorazine is a little bit older, but um um Ailify, which is sort of in that mixed class um just to help with the mood issues. Um, so I mean at least a third of the patients that come to our clinic and we see the wide range of everything and the patients that my colleagues see I'd say at least a third are at that such severe level and there's not enough providers out there.

[02:03:04] And is the medication temporary to get them through the therapy? It's necessary to get them through the therapy. It's sometimes how many of them can get off the medication? Um, I don't I don't have an answer to that. My I I'd probably I'd rough estimate probably at least a third, half. Um, but for a lot of people, they're afraid to come off the medications if they're at a stable point. And I'm a believer in if you're on the medication doing well and you want to stay on it, great for you. Um, some people try and come off and it creates a spike in symptoms and we immediately get back on. That's why most people will taper down and not just, you know, just go off medication.

[02:03:35] Um, my bigger concern is when someone is unfortunately not because they're trying to be, when they're unfortunately treatment resistant, which has a much more porative term that I want to be, but it means they're not they're treatment non-responders is what I should say. They're they're not responding to the normal pharmarmacology. And that's why we see people today, I have very little knowledge of the science and mech mechanics there, so I can't much speak much about it, but I see people now getting um deep brain stimulation um um ketamine um and um um other kind of pretty new age med medication interventions or device interventions. I know in the last few years there's been research looking at things like MDMA um and other sort of hallucinogens sometimes with VA veteran populations. are trying to figure out like what other medications out there, what other poorly controlled medications out there can can help people. Um, that excites me. It scares me because people go, "Oh, I can take I can take lowd dose psilocybin and like get better." That that's you're not taking you're not taking regulated low dodos psilocybin. You're experimenting with mushrooms. That's not the same thing. Um, you're trying ecstasy. That's not controlled MDMA. So all these new age technologies and medications are important because unfortunately there's going to be a population out there that doesn't respond to that doesn't respond to CBT. Still even even with the best studies, these kind of interventions are like 60 to 65% effective. There's other interventions out there like other metacognitive therapies and an intervention called inferencebased CBT.

[02:04:57] So like other cognitive based interventions that people have been developing and refining and improving, but that's still in that CBT range. 60% is not enough. And so, you know, I'm excited to see next wave genetic research and testing and medication research to figure out what are the ways can we find a way to sort of fix the where the brain is falling apart and where genetics kick in.

[02:05:17] You mentioned TMS briefly, but um where do you see the promise there? I don't right now. I mean, I think it's still in experimental phases. Um, you know, there's people that have short-term memory losses. My experience is that people have an initial improvement early on and then it fades. That's been my anecdotal experience of maybe knowing 15 to 20 patients in

[02:05:36] Atlanta. And Atlanta has a few TMS centers and ketamine infusion centers. Um I'm seeing actually more psychiatrists right now. Actually, psychiatrists in private practice, not even at like the universities I'm I'm I belong to and I go to are now offering ketamine infusions in private practice, which to me is like that's brand new kind of thinking. They're trying everything they can to offer patients stuff. So I don't know enough about the research and the science behind TMS and ketamine to speak to it at a large scale and then whether people should try it.

[02:06:02] But these are options that researchers and psychiatrists are looking into because we know that again CBT is 60% effective. SSRIs on a good day are 40 to 60% effective. For most studies, the combination of an SSRI or SNRI and CBT is usually the the best outcome. Um but they're still not treating everyone and not everyone can access them. And you know I I love what I do. I'm a pretty awesome therapist. I'm proud of what I do. I've trained a lot. I disseminate it. I I I try and make it as available and accessible and affordable to the people that come to our clinic. And there's I'm in a I'm in a Facebook group of about 5,000 specialists in a very closed private Facebook group who this is all we discuss this kind of stuff 247. It's an amazing Facebook group.

[02:06:44] It's been around for about eight or nine years. You can only be for practitioners only. Only for practitioners. There's tons of Facebook groups and social media platforms out there and other kind of things out there. And I'm on 20 other Facebook groups for but I'm in this one special one out there that two of my colleagues launched I think 2017 2018 that has right now almost 5,000 OCD body focus behavior BFRB like specially specially specialists of junior trainee to as senior and seasoned as they get which I'm getting to that stage in my career and we all have these discussions we all debate like what are the medication options what are the alternative uh interventions what do you think about this thing that someone podcasted about and we're all trying figure out how do we get another 5 to 10% efficacy with these populations who are just not getting better. Hospitals in the last few years have changed. And about 10 years ago, I felt like there were more hospital centers willing to take on residential patients. And right now, there's only about five that I know of in the country that I would view as sort of the best OCD centers. There's tons that pop up every day and things that IOP and PHP centers that sort of show up and I'm always supportive of them, but not if they're not doing evidence-based practices. Um, and so there's not enough of what I do out there, Peter, to meet the needs. And so hopefully other biologies and genetic testing and other interventions sort of increase this. But, um, at the end of the day, the kind of work that I do and that my staff does for cognitive, behaviorally based, exposure-based work for health, anxiety, and OCD sometimes with and without medication seems to be the most effective, the most available, um, and the most that gives people their life back afterwards. That excites me. I love that. How much are you guys seeing long CO that may or may not be long CO?

[02:08:26] I mean, it's again, it's it's not something I know anything about. So, I want to be mindful of not actually demonstrating just how ignorant I am, but you know, I'm not sure what long CO is. I'm sure that there is undoubtedly a subset of people who had COVID who are having an ongoing issue as a result of it. My intuition is there are also a lot of people who think they have that and in reality they either don't have anything medically wrong with them or maybe they have something else medically wrong with them. So you're probably far closer to that. But what are you seeing?

[02:08:56] I'm going to join you in the ignorance and and humility of I don't know enough about it to say anything major. But I think prior to CO people described identical symptoms that they're describing now attributing it to long co. And so if you look at that I've been practicing for almost 25 years. You can look at it and go, "Well, if it wasn't long co then because that word didn't exist, that phrase didn't exist. How could it be so high today?" I don't know the answer to your question, but I see people coming in with a set of head fog, fuzziness, inattentive stuff, kind of low-grade depression, not feeling great, having a hard time articulating, and like I had COVID a few times. I'm wondering if it's that. And I'm joining them thinking, I'm wondering if it's that too, but I have no idea. That doesn't serve my needs. How do I help you be adaptive? How do I help you function? Um, so I don't have a good sense of that, but I think it's an easy thing to latch on to. And people have gotten on disability for this. People have sought out medication treatments for this when in the past they just assumed that they had, you know, ADD or headaches or, you know, they had some head stuff going on. So, but is there a benefit in that situation of saying everything you just said, which is actually I don't know what it is, but I want to help you. I want to help you adapt to it. Can you take the next step and say, let's assume, for example, that whatever you're feeling, which is real, we're going to acknowledge that it's real, let's assume it's not attributable to um a biologic symptom and then we go down the same pathway. Is that a helpful framing?

[02:10:19] Remove the first part or the second part. Let's assume it is or is not a byproduct of biologic. You don't have a solution for it if it is biologic. I have solutions for it, whether it is or isn't. what do you want to do next? So, I really do stay in that gray space of okay, I don't know if you have cancer. And let me tell you, even in the book, even in the book, I have a I have a case report that a kind person allowed me to share um um where I treated her for health anxiety of GI tract esophageal issues,

[02:10:46] Peter, and then it was very successful and went great and she was starving herself and losing weight and like losing her life to a new medical conditions. And a year and change later, she writes me and says, "By the way, I have thyroid cancer." Now, did we miss that? And the answer is no because she was being followed by a thyroid specialist and was on synthroidid and other stuff. But but it's tricky because I don't take away from the work that we did. Yeah.

[02:11:09] Yeah. Like I'm I'm I don't know what I don't know. What I do know is your life is not as good as it could be. Can we try some stuff? I don't know whether you're you're going to get cancer or not. 33% of us hate to say this to people going to watch us are you and I 33% of us are going to get cancer. I have patients that don't know that we're born with cancer cells. Boy, does that piss them off when I tell them that. By the way, I don't know if it's going to express itself or not, but we all have cancer cells. Don't tell me that. So, um

[02:11:32] I don't know which people I'm going to see that are eventually going to have that thing that they were terrified of. I don't know the people I'm seeing right now that have something that's been unassessed and undiagnosed. What I know is there are things that I can teach someone of mind and body. You're not doing anything much different. You're just doing much more in the medicalized space that can give you better life today, that can elongate your life today, that can have you more present in your life today. And if you die tomorrow or 6 years from now, will you regret the things that we did to improve your life?

[02:11:58] And I'm I'm serious. Like the bracelet, you're not dead yet. You're not dead yet. So what do you want to do about it now? Because the other stuff you're concerned about, go to a doctor or not. Go to an im immunologist or not. Go to your ENT or not. That's your space. Here's what I can offer you. And I'm a mind I'm a believer of, you know, mind over matter. And you are what you think and you are what you do. And there are so many things that we don't tap into in our physical and mental capabilities. I love that part of my work as a CBT specialist. It's why you I got board certified. You can get board certified in like 17 domains. I got board certified in this CBT space. It's called behavioral and cognitive because there's so much that we can teach people about diet, nutrition, and exercise. These are things that are bigger for you than they are for me. About healthy lifestyle habits, about not getting fixated on thoughts like greed and regret and guilt that really eat at people alive. They're poisons to us and they manifest sematically. Th those things come out of us. though when someone comes to me and says I think I have this condition whether it's a seizure disorder cancer or long co I get to play I don't know anything about that what I do know is here are a set of skills I can teach you if you want to join me in that process I can make your life a little bit better or a lot better what do you want to do now you have agency now you get to choose and you might have that thing go do that thing go follow up with that doctor um but ultimately at the end of the day people are going to make decisions for themselves are either going to be about removing discomfort ambiguity and uncertainty negative reinforcement and or it's not just or doing things that give them a chance to improve their quality of life, relationships, romance, financial status, whatever it is. And so I like to help people do that, build rather than just remove bad. Um, but people come to someone like you and me and say, "Can you help me get rid of my symptoms?" I'm like, "I can, but can we also like add to your life?" And that's what positive reinforcement is. That's what living the fullest life is possible until you and I no longer have that time.

[02:13:51] Guess finally um I want to get a sense of where you think the balance lies between the abundance of information we have today about health and the uh the the whatever we want to call it the triggering of more health anxiety. Right? So, so at the outset of this podcast, we talked about um hey look, I'm I'm sure indirectly well directly but inadvertently I'm contributing, you know, people like me, you know, contribute to health anxiety.

[02:14:20] Um but of course, we contribute to a lot of good things as well, right? We contribute to a lot of Yeah, we I think we're I think we're a far net positive. So, what what steps could someone like me take to without diminishing the good reduce the bad? I appreciate you asking me that because um the work that you're doing is having people go to unbelievable lengths to with biomarkers and physical things for now and in the future. And my career and the things I focus on are about letting go of the future and focusing on the now. So there's a little bit of um there's a tension there.

[02:14:57] There's an attention there and I appreciate you acknowledging that. I think one of the nicest and kindest things that you can do is making sure that people are not absolutely dogmatically looking for a singular answer or a singular diagnosis or a singular cure. And I know you don't, but I would get concerned if someone was going to great lengths because they believe that there's only one fuel, one vitamin, one diagnosis, one biomarker that answers everything. And people who think that way, you and I both know are set up for failure because nothing is 100%. That's point one. in the work that you do is to not purport the belief that if we just solve that one genetic anomaly or if you just build more muscle mass, you're set because people hear that and your word is God, they're going to do that and they're not going to be able to fulfill that. Um, I also think teaching flexibility, cognitive flexibility is critical. So, you're asking people to take on a lot of new ideas. You're asking people to try new things, explore new things. Um, and that cognitive flexibility includes, hey, let's try something different than the thing you wanted to try. And so I almost this is kind of what exposure therapists are funny funny cats. We do weird stuff.

[02:15:59] I mean if you came to my office Peter we got stumps like dead stumps fake dead stumps and fake blood and fake semen and needles and and and and and animal skulls and band-aids and and weird outfits. We wear all sorts of like we are disrupting a lot and disruption is a good idea especially when someone's not expecting it and they get better for it. So I think in your space if you can continue to do what you're doing but add elements of surprise and disruption where it's not linear and it's not a silver bullet and you thought it was this and then you public say well we thought it was this we're changing our course. That level of disruption and flexibility just just promotes that we're all trying to achieve this final linear option but we're never going to get to linearity. There's going to be so many paths that we're all unique on. um and keeping people curious and flexible and not believing that you know if I take this shake and do this thing and find this bio bio marketer I'm going to live the best life possible because even you know that's not true but people want that people want the one solution you know we have these wonderful medications right now that are helping people lose weight that's fantastic but that's one of a thousand other options out there it's the quickest and maybe the easiest for certain people with and without side effects but those are not the only options and so I think when we start looking at these sort of medical and biologics that are sort of so effective and so efficient and so quick. Um, I think the medical industry sells that a little bit too much. And that's why people don't want to come see someone like me because they don't want to do therapy. They don't want to do this for 15 to 20 sessions.

[02:17:24] They don't have to like learn stuff. Just give me the pill or the the laser and it'll be great. And so I I always get worried about when physicians or medical people are selling wonderful lovely ideas that make your life better, but they're so this is like Jurassic Park when you're you're jumping science and going right to like the single thing and and you've jumped science and learning and knowledge and have you not learned from your past mistakes? And so that curiosity and that flexibility I think should be uh built into anything that you're doing, anything that I'm doing. And with my patients, I'm trying to be curious. I'm not right about everything. I'm probably wrong about half the things I'm telling them, but

[02:17:58] I'm going to keep trying and keep learning and we're going to have this this relationship that that is collaborative and it's going to be we call it collaborative empiricism. We're going to learn together and hopefully we're as you said net positive, more right than we are wrong. Um but inevitably inevitably a small percentage of the people that follow what you and other people put out there about living your best healthiest life, which is fantastic, are going to take it one degree too far and believe that that is all they can do. And unfortunately that's that's you know a percentage of any population out there that's going to get trapped into looking for the single solution or the single medicine or the single biomarker and they're going to go to great lengths to solve that and in my work that ruins people's lives. So it doesn't discredit all the amazing things you do. It's just staying flexible and curious and not believing that any one thing solves anything um is all I would ask of you.

[02:18:45] You mentioned that your practice takes care of patients in 40 states. So I assume that means tele medicine is a big part of what you guys do. Yeah, prior to the pandemic, um, a lot of states got together, psych, a lot of states for psychologists, um, came together and developed a, um, a jurisdiction approval called scypact psyac and it allowed those of us, this happened started before the pandemic, which was very innovative and then in the pandemic it sort of, you know, just exploded where therapists if they got approved by this with going through a few check boxes, probably paid some few a few fees, which I, you know, you paid and filled out your credentials and history and proved you have no bad stuff. um become a psych scypact eligible provider and that means I can see people in the 40 states that have agreed interstate jur juristp prudence allowance and so that has expanded our ability to do tellahalth prior to the pandemic I already did tell health in the state of Georgia there's plenty of rural pockets um or people that just want Atlanta traffic sucks people don't like driving Atlanta so I was doing teleah health anyways um but scypact has allowed providers who have doctorate level degrees to be approved to see people in those many states what are the 10 that don't um you can Yes, you can guess two of them that want to hold on to their money and regulations. Who do you think those two are?

[02:19:54] I would guess California, New York. Yep. Those two. That's why I say we'll stop. Eight. I don't care about. But those two are probably never going to agree because of all the reasons that are just so wrong, unfortunately. And and I only ask because I know that people listening to this are going to want to sort of have a have an opportunity to probably reach out and work with you. So sadly, people who live in California, New York, you are not able to work with.

[02:20:13] Anyone who is unless you're licensed in that state, you cannot do tele medicine with people in that state. Sadly. Um, and there's no good reason for that. The other eight states, I couldn't tell you what they are, but it's probably just because they haven't addressed it or approved it yet. Um, and currently there's an equivalent thing called compact for the masters level providers out there. They're trying to do the same level of interstate access.

[02:20:33] And you can't get a California license and I can, but I'm not going to. I see. Okay. The cost and and the time to get a California license. By the way, I have I have a ton of California colleagues that are fantastic and do great work. Same thing in New York. ironically despite those two states that I can't they have an abundance of people plenty of people are doing great stuff there got it um and so yes so at a mast's level there's another another thing called compact that might come around in the next year or two to give simil similar increased access increased availability to these kind of vulnerable interventions but yes so we've been doing tele medicine and and I think in the last year or two we've been as we've been monitoring it um we're probably doing more than 50% sessions on video possibly close to 60% I don't love it. I do it. I love it when I'm doing it with people who need it because they can't get to someone like me any other way. I don't love it doing it with people who just don't want to drive across town or just, you know, want to find the easy way out. I get that. Um, but it has increased the ability for someone like me and colleagues in my space who are doing what I hope is described as best practices and being very ethical, very being very compassionate and helping people get their lives back as soon as possible. It's increased our availability and accessibility, which I think is absolutely fantastic and and should be the way.

[02:21:46] Well, Josh, appreciate you coming out here. This has been a really interesting discussion. Um, yeah, honestly, this is more complex than I had imagined, but I think that's often the case. Whenever I do an interview on a podcast, I I uh uh I always come out learning much more than I I thought I would learn even. So, so thanks for sharing your expertise and thanks for what you're doing.

[02:22:02] I appreciate it. Thank you. [Music]

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Whenever I think of the brain, I think of GBMs, right? I think of these awful tumors. Is there anything on the horizon to render them less lethal? We are making progress and specifically around understanding what causes. I think that neurosurgery remains a little bit of a black box. So, we're starting to see things like stroke become more like heart attacks.

[00:00:19] These are really gamechanging things when someone can go home the next day after such a huge thing. Let's talk a little bit about brain computer interface. I think in a nutshell what it means is a system that is recording from the brain and connecting those signals to a computer that analyzes the signal and then does something with it.

[00:00:38] Have people understand how you even do awake surgery. The brain itself doesn't have any pain receptors. I think the thing that struck me the most the first time I saw neurosurgery was how the hell do they know what they're doing? Like how how many billion cells did we just lop off there? There is this like popular idea that we only need 10% of our brain. I'm sure you've heard this before.

[00:01:01] I I've heard this and I don't know what it means. It sounds like malarkey to me, right? What do you think the world looks like in 2040? Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia. [Music] Betty, thank you so much for uh taking a a time out of your your very busy schedule to come to Austin. Really excited to talk with you today.

[00:01:24] Oh, I'm thrilled to be here. Thanks, Peter. So, um there's so much I want to talk about with respect to what your career is about today and um what the field of neurosurgery is is is in today and you know how how the bounds are really being pushed. But as as we were talking earlier, um I think that neurosurgery remains a little bit of a black box and it might help orient our listeners if we give a little bit of a history lesson. Um so can we orient ourselves back into the latter part of the 19th century and and what what were the typical problems that would have presented to a neurosurgeon and what were the tools that they had at their disposal? And let's let's posit that we're speaking after the development of anesthesia at least so we're not in completely gruesome lands of you know holding people down.

[00:02:16] Yeah. Um well that is a really interesting question and one of the reasons nuros surgery is a little bit of black box is in many ways people consider it sort of like extreme medicine right it's like a very small uh group of physicians that are taking care of patients fairly severe kind of indications a really rarified field that takes a very long training in addition um but let's say we go back a hundred years um we're talking about the era of

[00:02:44] Harvey Kushing who's considered really the father of modern neurosurgery and um I think that was a clear inflection point in the history of medicine in the here history of neuroscience in the history of neurosurgery really the beginning of what we would call the modern neurosurgery and um why I think that Cushing was so powerful was uh his observation uh in addition to his ability to uh do extraordinary surgeries. So in addition to um being really an astute observer um in addition to being an incredibly technically skilled surgeon um I think he was also an incredible internist too uh diagnosing some of the first pituitary tumors and the effects of those on you know uh endocrine function.

[00:03:34] Um and then um really the era of like modern tools of cranottomy you know opening the skull to get access to brain tumors. Um and everything followed since then. You know the main categories of neurosurgery have to do with tumors uh the vascular system which are aneurysms and strokes and blood clot spine. And then probably the most recent one is the one we call functional which actually has to do with um understanding the functions of the brain circuit but also intervening to change um how they work using deep brain stimulation or other ablation methods and um those are the really exciting new developments and and I think Harvey Kushing would be credited for the development of the electrocottery as well wouldn't he?

[00:04:20] Absolutely. I mean there's like a hard to imagine that you could operate without one of those things. Yeah. And not just in the brain, but anywhere in the body. Yeah. It's like the key of controlling bleeding in any surgery, but but particularly in the brain. Yeah. It's a tricky thing. And so, um, Harvey

[00:04:37] Kushing was just, um, the starting point of modern neurosurgery. Then there's Wilder Penfield who, uh, was an American but really did some, uh, incredible work in creating the Montreal Neurological Institute. And um that was really the beginning of what we'd call consider modern epilepsy surgery. So surgeries that are designed to stop people from having seizures. And he popularized this thing that we all learn in medical school uh called the homunculus. It's this picture right of uh the little man there. And um essentially the part of our brain that controls every muscle in our body and how it's laid out in that particular part of the brain. It's something that we all learn. Um he's also um a brilliant scientist who helped us understand you know some of the basic things that we know about language and from a technical perspective really popularized and developed uh the concept of awake brain surgery. Um and that's really um something that's captivated me since medical school and what I now specialize in now. So let's kind of fast forward a little bit into um an era sort of before you and I were in medical school. Um but you know sort of call it the the the 70s and the 80s. What was the state-of-the-art call it 40 50 years ago with respect to the vascular management the oncologic management of masses in the brain u relative to today. So uh so so exclusive of the interventional side of things just in terms of being able to operate on the brain when did it kind of like where were the plateaus in in technology?

[00:06:20] Yeah. Well um what's interesting about it is some of the things that we do now are almost identical to the way that Cushing did it over 100 years ago and then some of it is radically different. So um you know one of the workhorse surgeries that we do is called a cranottomy and that basically means where you remove a piece of bone temporarily you you know replace it at the end of the procedure to access something like a brain tumor that's in the frontal or temporal lobe and um that's still being performed today and still really indicated. Um but where we are now um there's ways of using laser probes through very small incisions to get to deep targets in the brain to ablate them. Um there are ways of now even using focus ultrasound that can be targeted you know to specific nuclei in deep parts of the brain in order to control someone's tremor for example. Uh this is um what would consider a relatively non-invasive approach to to do a neurosurgery. Um so things have changed radically. I would say um one other area where we have seen uh tremendous uh disruption actually is in the vascular neurosurgery field. So um back in the 80s and 90s uh you'd have a large cranottomy and incision probably about you know seven to nine inches long uh removal of piece of bone and then you using an operative microscope to dissect down to the deepest parts where the blood vessels are coming and uh to fix let's say an aneurysm which is essentially a ballooning of a of a blood vessel that um when it ruptures can be fatal. And so um that is a lot of what I trained on. Um nowadays 90% of those procedures are now done you know through a catheter in the groin that's visualized. Um we put coils into the aneurysms to help secure them. We can now do stances. um a huge change actually now has been able to um now being able to retrieve and uh dissolve clots that are you know causing acute severe strokes. So um those are probably the most dramatic things that we've seen someone come in uh not able to talk uh paralyzed on half side of the body. Um in the old days we would just give some medications keeping our fingers crossed that that would work. it rarely worked.

[00:08:55] It was really the minority of cases that it helped. But nowadays, there's a much bigger fraction of patients where you can put the device in, retrieve uh the stroke. And um these are really game-changing things when someone can go home the next day after such a huge thing. So, we're starting to see things like stroke become more like heart attacks. The cath labs are not just treating heart attacks, but they're also treating what we call um brain attacks or strokes. So um some things are relatively similar to 100 years ago and then some things have just been totally changed.

[00:09:29] Yeah. So so if 30 years ago a neurosurgeon was doing a cranottomy virtually every time they were addressing a pathology today it might be less than half the time. Yeah that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Um and again that that's not an un a dissimilar parallel to what we see in other parts of surgery. I was just talking to a vascular surgeon a couple of weeks ago um who was finished his training around the time I did and I said you know how many open uh surgical procedures are you doing you know I was talking about AAA's and all sorts of you know fem pops and things like that and he said yeah we do very little open these days it's virtually all done with stances um which again uh you know even even CA like corateed arteries the whole thing I was really blown away at how little they are operating now. Uh meaning operating in an open sense. Obviously, they're still intervening.

[00:10:24] Yeah, absolutely. I think that um I think what's happened with surgery is that um and this is not a trend. This is the force of evolution that is guiding us towards things that are more minimally invasive. Uh less collateral damage, you know, to get to the targets and getting people back to life, you know, sooner. And um it's a very exciting time actually to be in medicine with all this technology that's coming on board. It's um if if you if you're okay with that change, it's absolutely thrilling time. Yeah.

[00:10:58] Now, I know this is not your field of interest, so feel free to say, "Yeah, I don't know enough about it." But whenever I think of the brain, I I I I think of GBMs, right? I think of these awful tumors. Uh which I guess for the listener, we can explain what that is. Um, so, so maybe tell folks what a GBM is, why a GBM is, um, truly one of the cancers that gives cancer a bad name.

[00:11:21] And, and, and I guess my real question for you is, given that traditional surgery has historically never worked for this tumor, you simply can't resolve it. And you think about the transition away from cranottomy, big open procedure, is there anything on the horizon for for GBMs to to render them less lethal?

[00:11:41] Yeah, it's a great question. So, GBM stands for glyobblastoma multififormy and it's a mouthful of a word, but um if you break it down um what it's referring to, the gal part of that word refers to the cell origin. Um the brain has different types of cells. And if you look in the big buckets, there's neurons, which are the ones that primarily are the ones that allow us to do thinking and function. And then there's a large population of support cells that we call ga and that's that first part glyopblastoma originates from those support cell population. Multiforme refers to you know these original descriptions hisystologically of the tumors that really showed um um multiple form multiple hisystologology. Some of the key features of it are the necrosis. The tumor grows so quickly that it outstrips its blood supply and in its wake it leaves cell death, what we call necrosis. So like you alluded to, it really is um you know a terrible kind of disease and condition. Um we are making progress and specifically around understanding what causes. So you know just 10 years ago uh you would remove one of these tumors and you send it to the lab and you could get the diagnosis of that this is a global. Now uh in most academic medical centers you'll also get a genetic profile of the tumor. So nowadays we actually know specifically what kind of mutations are involved in the tumor and that's going to be really critical for this next chapter which is using those genetic alterations actually to um to tailor and personalize you know uh chemotherapy and more. So um this has big implications because um we're now moving from an era where we use a visualization of the hisytologology now to this molecular profiling which is more mechanistic. um the new chemo agents are really going to be targeting mechanisms as opposed to general things like cell cycle um and metabolism and things like that. So um these are the things that are changing you know and we need it to change faster. Um there are also really exciting things that we're seeing around new ways to train the immune immune cells to to target things. It turns out that glyobblastomas actually suppress parts of the immune system. So they they're kind of like growing in stealth and they activate, you know, molecules and cells in a in a cloak way that can't be recognized by immune cells anymore.

[00:14:21] And so if we can basically allow the tumors to be recognized by the immune system, that could be something that really unlocks therapy in the future, too. Um but um the things that we do know that work pretty well right now at least in terms of prolonging survival for patients and really meaningful survival actually still is around the surgery. We do know that the more extensive the resection um the longer the survival is and that's been really well characterized now but it's not curative like you said we can remove 99% or even 100 and beyond what we see on the MRI. Um, unfortunately there's usually microscopic cells that go beyond what we can see on the MRI that are still there and over time will repopulate, you know, um, the tumor. And so it is a really complicated and and and tough disease, but we're working really hard on it.

[00:15:14] Do we have any idea what predisposes an individual to this from a risk perspective? Short answer is no because it afflicts young, it afflicts old. I mean, I've watched children die of this, teenagers, people in midlife, people at the end of life. It seems to have no apparent pattern. Yeah. And part of that has to do with its mechanisms. It's not something that we consider as a heritable kind of risk. Um, but what it does rely on is a set of mutations and it's never it's rarely the same set, which is a very polygenic condition.

[00:15:47] Exactly. And that's what makes it, you know, really tricky to treat. Um, when we talk about glyopblast, we're actually not talking about one thing. We're talking about a system of genetic alterations that together have cascaded in into the form that we see. And I suspect we'll we'll come back to this

[00:16:05] Eddie, but you've alluded to chemotherrapeutic agents that can be used whether it's to treat glyopblastoia or anything else, including METs of other epithelial cancers that spread to the brain. Um the bloodb brain barrier poses a challenge for treatment. Do you think the future lies in treatment within the CMS uh the C the CSF? So treating directly inside I don't know intratheally or directly into the central nervous system uh or do you think it's designing drugs that cross the bloodb brain barrier? I mean what do you think the future looks like? I think it's going to look like all of the above actually. And this is a situation where we do need to look at all possible options. This is not like the kind of thing where we're thinking like um non-invasive or minimally invasive like really something that will work as the first priority. Um one of the technologies I'm I'm really um interested in following how this develops and we're doing research on this at UCSF is using focus ultrasound.

[00:17:06] Though most people know about ultrasound to diagnose, but if you change the energy profile of it, you can actually use acoustic energy through an ultrasound to uh actually open up the bloodb brain barrier and targeted parts of the brain. And so there is a lot of development on using that as a way to do delivery as opposed to putting a catheter or something directly in the brain. and then um with that a set of new agents that can be really molecularly specific to get to targets once you open up that bloodb brain barrier.

[00:17:39] So what attracted you to neurosurgery? Was it something you knew you wanted to do when you went to medical school or did you figure it out while there? I had a sense it was probably latent. Uh I always knew that I was really interested in neuroscience. So the general field um it wasn't until I was in medical school um that I was actually exposed to it and um I remember really clearly in my first year I had this neuroanatomy professor Diane Rson who was really um incredibly kind person who uh was patient with me as we were learning you know you you probably remember in med school like learning hundreds of different parts of the brain anatomy All of which I've forgotten. I know there's a brain stem somewhere in there.

[00:18:24] There's somewhere something like that. Yeah. So, um that's part of our ritual, right, in medical school to learn all of those terms and locations. Um but as you know, you know, certain teachers like just make such a huge difference. And so um you know she took me to the operating room one day and um you know I saw uh one of my mentors um at the time I was just a student but he ultimately became my mentor uh Dr. burger doing a wake surgery on a patient with a glyopblastto.

[00:18:57] And um you know the surgery itself I thought was pretty interesting but the part that left me aruck and the part that basically made it very hard for me to sleep for a couple days was really just seeing um an exposed brain. What the cortex looks like. The cortex is the outermost part of the brain. Um it pulsates, it moves. Um but those are not from the mechanics of the brain itself. Those are all just from the breathing and the heart rate etc. You know it's a blood flow coming through.

[00:19:36] So, um, you know, the thing that really struck awe for me was seeing a patient talking and not fully comprehending, but really being in awe of the kind of computations that must be happening in this part of the brain. And it's not like you're looking at a computer. It's you're looking at essentially an organ composed of biological cells. Uh, 86 billion to be precise. You know, how many neurons there are in the human brain. So that scene to me um was deeply inspiring and

[00:20:12] I was basically hooked. Um I was so like hooked that I didn't really understand what I was signing up for. Um because the training for it after that, you know, was uh pretty difficult. I have to say seven years and um uh but it was worth it and I love every minute of it and I'm still learning of course. Um we're at the very beginning of of a new inflection point in neurosurgery which is understanding you know how the human brain works.

[00:20:44] There was an epiphany you had at some point in residency wasn't there? Well, I think there's an epiphany about um well, we have this access really privileged access um to use the information uh what we call brain mapping basically. And so um we do the brain mapping because we want to be very precise about um how we're approaching for example brain tumor or a spot of the brain that's causing seizures. And we do the brain mapping so that we can map out the areas that are really important for language or the ability uh to move your arm. Um that's what we call the brain mapping. And we want to identify those areas so we can protect them during the surgery. At the same time do the maximal resection like we spoke about earlier. The more that we can remove the tumor, the longer the survival. The more that we can remove of the seizure zone, the more likely someone is going to be cured of their epilepsy. Um but in neurosurgery there can always be a cost right and that cost would be paralysis or aphasia which is a condition where you lose the ability to speak and so we're always trying to balance you know sort of like is it worth it to go that extra couple of millimeters versus versus not and in many cases these are really profoundly important decisions that have to be made right then and there in the operating room and brain mapping is a way that we um figure this out. In the old days,

[00:22:15] Wilder Penfield 150 years ago, 120 years ago, would use an electrical stimulator and would apply it to the cortex. Um, and that will temporarily activate or disrupt the function of a specific part of the brain while someone is trying to speak or move. And that's traditionally how we've done mapping. And that's one of the the tools the techniques we still use today um in order to make sure you know patients are safe during these procedures. Um one of the revelations I had during residency of course is that I think we can do a lot more than just applying stimulators to do the mapping. Um we've developed technologies to record from the brain that allows us to not only do the mapping but also is really the first window that we have of like understanding like essentially how neurons work, how they um convey information about words for example like in the conversation we're having there's a part of your brain in the temporal lobe uh which is right above your ear on both sides but the one on the left in particular uh you're right-handed right?

[00:23:24] Yeah. So 99% of right-handers are dominant for language on the left side and there's this one spot in the temporal lobe which is just about 2 centimeters above your left ear that's processing all the words that I'm speaking to you right now. And so we've used this technology not only to map those critical functions and that's sort of where the science was I would say about 10 or 15 years ago figuring out where these functions are in the brain and now we've moved the science to understanding how those areas work um by a progressive evolution of new technologies to get us you know to higher and higher resolution. And what I mean by that is um we can measure the neural activity of cells and cell populations and then link them to for example different consonants and vowels and that's been really an ex like extremely exciting development in human neuroscience.

[00:24:22] I want to back up and just have people understand how you even do awake surgery because the traditional way that surgery is done requires general anesthesia. That's right. General anesthesia typically requires three things. Um it requires one type of medication uh to to blunt pain. Yeah. Another type of medication to block memory and another type of medication to paralyze you.

[00:24:49] Now of course if things go wrong and things have gone wrong sometimes patients are paralyzed but they feel pain but they can't communicate it. And these are these catastrophic but fortunately very rare events that occur in anesthesia. But correct anesthesia is done where a patient has no sense of time or memory of anything. They can't feel anything and they can't move, which means they're actually safe, right? It's it's to that's to save them as well.

[00:25:13] So, help us understand how it is that you can do surgery without all three of those conditions being present. Like I said in the beginning, this is extreme form of medicine, extreme form of surgery. Um, and the way that in a nutshell it can be done is that the brain itself doesn't have any pain receptors. So the pain receptors are the ones that are in our nerves that are in the scalp that are throughout our body. These are actually the way that we perceive pain and touch. And um you know I think it's paradoxical to many people at first but the brain itself which is processing that information in the body actually doesn't have those receptors itself. So the way that we typically do this is to numb the the scalp. We use things like when you go to the dentist office like lidocaine we can inject around the site of the incision. Um the bone by the way doesn't have any pain receptors itself either. um the membrane on top of the brain that we call the dura does have some pain receptors. So sometimes we have to be sensitive around that and do some uh local anesthesia around the dura and interestingly the brain tissue itself doesn't. There are some other areas like around the blood vessels that can be sensitive. The membrane the dura is sensitive. So um there are areas but they can be numbed. And so this is a really important fact that allows us to do these surgeries awake when it's necessary to do it.

[00:26:48] So the patient is rolled and I've seen these and I I just I'm blanking on exactly the procedure. So the patient is rolled into the O. They're not intubated, right? Correct. Then never intubated during this. Yeah. Yeah. So they're this is a patient who is laying there wide awake, no endotraccheial tube, right?

[00:27:06] Maybe a Foley catheter for some comfort. Yes. Foley catheter. Okay. Yeah. And usually foley are not that comfortable. Exactly. But but uh primarily so that we can monitor the urine output during the surgery. And you begin by you know making your incision. I mean drawing where you want to make your incision and then literally just doing this as though it's a local um you know like you're having a lipoma removed or something. You're literally just covering the lidocaine and epinephrine across the scalp. You're boing down to where you need to go. Y once you get to the bone, you can start to literally put a hole in and start to saw across your holes.

[00:27:45] Yeah. Yeah. So, just to add a little bit more detail to that, which is that um usually the head is fixed. So, it's not like someone's sitting in a chair and we're just doing this while they're moving around, but we we have a head holder that fixes the head. You can move around and they're sedated. The patient is somewhat sedated and then you can lift the sedation. Yeah. Exactly. Right. And so we do a light level of sedation like propifall or like propall but a much much lower dose.

[00:28:13] So it's not a general anesthesia dosing. It's a very very light dosing. They call it the party dose. Um and that way it allows the anesthesiologist to stop it when you say hey we're you know because we might need an hour to get in. At that point it's okay for them to be in La La Land but then I want it off once we have to get inside.

[00:28:34] Absolutely. And so the period that someone is actually awake during the surgery is usually only an hour or two. Even if the surgery is like 6 or 8 hours long um and primarily for comfort, we'll do sedation at the very beginning. We'll have the sedation turned off so patient can be fully awake for napping and then and then you can ramp up the sedation to finish the procedure and close them. But again, it's all done at the level of a colonoscopy, not the level of general anesthesia. Yeah. Um, again, we were talking before the podcast how my second month of general surgery, I did neurosurgery, meaning we rotated through it. And one of the things that blew my mind was how for it sounds silly, but when you when you look at textbooks and you study the homunculus and you look at all of the vascule and then you actually look at the brain, it's just like any other organ. It's just kind of a blah. It's like looking at the pancreas for the first time. You're like, "That's it.

[00:29:35] How do I know where everything is, right?" And um I guess what makes it different is there's probably no part of the body where the real estate matters so much, right? Um when you're operating on other parts of the body, for example, if you're operating on the heart, you can really see what you're doing, right? You know where the left anterior descending artery is. you know where the occlusion is and even though it's very technically uh complicated surgery um there is complete anatomic clarity of what is happening.

[00:30:09] Yeah. And I think the thing that struck me the most the first time I saw neurosurgery was how the hell do they know what they're doing? Like how how many billion cells did we just lop off there? And obviously this speaks to what you're talking about from a functional standpoint but um but a lot of times you're not doing that right. So if a patient has a meningioma or or some other tumor um how how do you bracket that tradeoff? So do you do you s just sort of say look there are places where you never want to have a tumor for example right above my left ear that would be a really difficult place to have to resect because the real estate is so precious and that's where we're going to probably recommend doing an open awake procedure to help guide us.

[00:30:55] Is that kind of how you're using that? That's exactly right. And so, um, the real estate is critical. That's an understatement. Um, but that being said, there is some really expensive real estate in and there's also some cheaper real estate. But that's I guess that's my point, Eddie. It's like that's sort of like telling me about

[00:31:18] Manhattan. Yeah. Like there's no cheap real estate in Manhattan. There happen to be areas that are $10,000 a square foot, but there's probably nothing less than 4,000 a square foot. So, so there's this like popular idea that we only need 10% of our brain. I'm sure you've heard this. I've heard this and I don't know what it means. It sounds like malarkey to me, right? So, that might mean to stay alive.

[00:31:40] Okay. Right. To to to respire, you might only need 10% of your brain. So what what it really means is that there is maybe about 10 or 15% that um is very critical for our basic functions, our ability to move, to talk, you know, to see etc. It's actually a lot more than that. But um it's also referring to this point that there are parts of our brain actually that are extremely redundant with other parts of the brain. So the frontal loes for example um we do surgeries there routinely and often times people really have no effect even in terms of judgment even in terms of

[00:32:19] Absolutely. Yeah. So because we always think of the frontal lobe as where we have sort of executive function and where we have the ability we always joke like one of my friends in med school we said he had no frontal lobe. Exactly. He just couldn't stop saying the most inappropriate things. And don't get me wrong, uh the frontal lobe actually has a lot of critical function for executive decision making, you know, impulse control, etc. But um my point is that it's redundant, meaning that um different parts of the frontal lobe actually have similar purposes and similar role. And so um for the most part, a lot of our patients can accommodate a fairly large surgery.

[00:32:55] Sometimes even removing the entire frontal lobe, both sides. No, not both sides really. Uh usually these pathologies are only on one side. So if you took the entire frontal lobe from the left or right side, would there would there be a sub a substantial difference? Uh I've done that many times just so you know. And um it really depends on the case and scenario. If someone's been having something that's slower growing there and there's been time for the brain to reorganize, what we call plasticity, a lot of those functions will essentially no longer be in that right frontal lobe and they've moved to the left side. Wow.

[00:33:32] And people can tolerate. What is the mechanism by which that happens? Well, um time and function meaning like these things don't happen overnight. They take you know sometimes weeks and years. But basically what happens is some neurons get lost over time and then others will compensate in in in terms of that function.

[00:33:53] But how does that actually happen? So let's pause it. We have a slow growing lesion in the left frontal lobe. What is the left frontal lobe doing to communicate with the right frontal lobe to say, hey, these neurons are being compromised. Their function is deteriorating. You guys need to pick up the slack. How is that message being transmitted? Well, part of it is that both parts of the frontal lobe for people, most people are are both doing the function most of the time. So, it's not like it's just transferring the information. It's that both sides were originally, you know, involved in those functions and then one side gets weaker and the other one has to pick up that slack. Um, at a cellular level, this is what we call synaptic plasticity. uh the weights that you know essentially make up who we are. These are just the weights that neurons use to communicate with one another. All of our learning is towards shaping that waiting of synapses that occur where neurons touch each other. And um that that can that can happen that can change you know throughout our life. Every time we learn a new word those are new synapses that have formed that were never there. new connections um precisely from the left to the right side there is this structure that we call the corpus colossum it's an information highway that connects the left part of our brain from the right side um there was a Nobel prize Roger Sperry who done a really incredible early experiments describing patients who had surgeries where you split that and in certain instances you have this phenomena where people essentially like have two functioning brains but they're not communicating to each each other. Um, so it does require that there is this connection between the two areas where they're being reorganized.

[00:35:43] Now, outside of epilepsy, why else would the corpus be severed? That's really the main one that we use it for. Can you describe how patients that uh undergo that procedure behave? It's very fascinating. Yeah. So, um there's a phenomenon that we call a dissociation syndrome. So, basically um Okay. So the the clinical indication the medical indication for why someone would undergo this nowadays is that um patients some patients with seizures have uh severe seizures where they um fall down what we call drop attacks. Um and usually what that means is that the seizure is spreading so quickly across the brain that people lose the tone in the body and then basically fall. And why that becomes a problem in addition to you know the the injury of the seizures is that people actually injure themselves. So it's not uh uncommon for people who have these kind of seizures actually to be wearing helmets all the time because they're at such high these are these are just medically recalcitrant seizures. They cannot be prevented with any degree of

[00:36:53] That's right. That's absolutely right. I see. AB like without any kind of medication or any other and these are particularly ones that um there's not one small spot that's causing the seizure. It's you know like the whole half or quadrant of the brain. But the problem is and a se what what a seizure is is basically when you have this very uncontrolled synchrony of a large mass of the brain cells. So, normally if you think about the brain and the neurons within the brain, it's like people in a stadium, they're having their individual conversations. Um, that's the way the brain normally works.

[00:37:30] Um, but let's say all of a sudden everyone's doing a wave and something hypercoordinated. All of those like normal conversations are now gone. The brain has now become hijacked by this other phenomena where everything has become very coordinated. That's why people lose consciousness because all the normal function is basically shut down. And the way that it can become synchronized is through its connectivity, right? Every cell connecting to its adjacent cell and every cell connected to all the other cells in the brain through the things like the corpus colosum that connects left to the right. And so when you get that hyper synchrony, people can essentially lose consciousness almost instantaneously.

[00:38:15] So one of the reasons historically why the corpus calistomy was invented in the very first place was to sever the connection between the left and right hemisphere which doesn't stop the seizure. It just limits the spread. That's exactly right. It doesn't stop the seizure but what it what it does is stops the propagation the very fast propagation of the seizure from one side to the other. And in order for someone to lose consciousness, you basically have to have both sides of the hemisphere or a deeper structure like the phalamus. That's basically how consciousness uh in order to have consciousness, you have to have both hemispheres um out uh in order to lose consciousness or a deeper structure in the phalamus or something like that. Um and so um these kind of uh drop attack uh seizures are ones that you know uh people blackout fall uh and one way you can actually dramatically stop a lot of that is disconnecting the left from the right hemisphere.

[00:39:20] And so how does that patient how is their life different aside from the fact that hopefully their drop seizures are gone? What's the change in the way that their left and right behave now disconnected? Most of the time when we do this nowadays, we disconnect about the anterior 2/3 of the corpus colossum. And the reason why we don't typically transsect the whole corpus colossum is because of some of the side effects that people can have and it's what we call a dissociation syndrome where you can basically have a dissociation between what the left brain is doing and the right brain. Um so for example someone essentially feeling something on the right hand which is processed by the left part of the brain and the right part of the brain really having no awareness of what's going on and um people can get by with that but um you know does affect how they can get along.

[00:40:13] So nowadays we try to um just do the front part of it and leave the back part that helps reduce some of those side effects. But does it solve the initial problem of the seizures? Yes. No, it doesn't cure the seizures, but it really just stops the propagation of the seizures so that people don't lose consciousness. But sorry, by leaving one/ird in the posterior still adjacent, it prevents the propagation across the hemispheres.

[00:40:39] In many in many many cases in some cases nowadays still we have to do a total total calisottomy. And um it's a um it's a very delicate surgery because the corpus colossum that connects the left and the right, it's not sitting on the top of the brain, it's actually it's very deep. It's very deep. So to get there, you actually have to physically separate the left and right hemisphere. We do that from the top.

[00:41:03] We do a cranottomy that's centered over the midline. Um but it can't be right over the midline because we have a large draining vein there called the superior sagittal sinus. So we have to either choose the left side or the right side and then we have to very carefully separate the left from the right uh and through that narrow corridor uh transsect those connections.

[00:41:24] And what's directly underneath it that prevents you from uh just running that boie a little too hot? Oh um well there is a blood vessel that runs along the top of the corpus colossum and that's actually the most critical part of the surgery is that we separate those two branches those pericosal arteries. Those arteries are really important because they supply the part of the brain the medial frontal cortex and uh the part of that that um is part of the motor cortex actually is what supplies and controls our legs. So if you have a stroke let's say as a side effect or complication of that procedure then someone would be paralyzed in the leg.

[00:42:03] Um so um it's a fun delicate surgery. It's amazing to sort of you know see that exposure of the corpus colosum. It's glistening white and that's how we can see it and it's very distinct from the cortex because it's really clear white. That white comes from the myelin. Yeah. Um it's a heavily heavily mileinated structure because it's conveying information from the left side of our brain to the right side on the order of milliseconds. You know, uh a super fast uh connection. Do do you ever think philosophically about what the implications are for human consciousness by the fact that you can do a complete transsection of the corpus and seemingly produce two people?

[00:42:50] That's right. um or potentially two consciousnesses. Yeah. What does that mean? Well, I think that um goes back to a harder question of like how do you define what consciousness is in the first place? And this is where there's a lot of philosophical debate about that. Do you trouble yourself with such debates? I mean, not really.

[00:43:09] No. Okay. I Yeah, I I I can't because I can't wrap my head around it. Yeah. It's above my pay grade. Yeah. Um I do think about it from sort of the practical clinical perspective. Uh not so much the philosophical. The clinical one is like is a patient in a coma or not and why and how do we get them out of that? You know traumatic brain injury, certain strokes, um epilepsy, etc. Um we think about consciousness from that perspective literally all the time every day. Um, but from the philosophical, uh, I don't lose a lot of sleep over that one. Yeah,

[00:43:46] I lose a little bit of sleep over it. Um, let's let's talk a little bit about a brain computer interface. You you've mentioned it already. Um, I hope I'm not insulting people when I say this, but if we're going to be brutally honest, we should at least acknowledge that that medicine to date has been pretty unimpressive when it comes to treating neurodeenerative disease. Um, so whether we're talking about Alzheimer's disease or even other non- degenerative forms of dementia, whether we're talking about

[00:44:21] Parkinson's disease, uh, blue garri's disease, I mean, we just don't seem to be able to treat these diseases. So, whatever medications we throw at these things, they maybe in the case of Parkinson's disease, we can we can delay progression a little bit. But would you agree with that assessment that that sort of the traditional approach to treating these diseases has been largely unsuccessful?

[00:44:47] I I would largely agree um with a caveat that I think a lot of progress is being made to understand what's going on and from that I think there's a lot of promising therapies. But I would generally agree that within neurology and neurosurgery traditionally um therapy has really been designed to stop things from getting worse or slowing progression.

[00:45:14] Replacing function has never really been possible until very recently. Yeah. And I guess what I want want to understand from you because I think this is something that you know more about than than anyone um or certainly among the the people who would know the most about it is do we need to revisit our approach to these diseases more from an engineering perspective than from um a peripherally administered medication perspective. Right? So the traditional approach to treating disease uh would be medication. Right? you you you take an injection, you take a pill, you take something and you hope that enough of it gets across the blood brain barrier and it starts to treat the the the condition at hand. But it's hard to look at a patient with Parkinson's disease um which is a motor defect disease uh admittedly that stems from the CNS um and not at least think h you know this is a functional condition right why isn't there or is there an engineering approach that could be taken to this yeah uh it's a good question and um I don't think that well let me put it this

[00:46:31] Um, medications are always going to be a really important goal. Um, not only to sort of reduce symptoms, but hopefully find cures. Um, but there's this whole other class of therapies that are coming online that have to do with this other property of brain cells which is very different than let's say the pancreas or the liver.

[00:46:59] It's the electrical side of the equation. So there's the chemical and biological side, but then there's this electrical side and the brain is an electrical organ. Our thoughts are really dependent on these electrochemical kind of processes that happen um at individual neurons and uh the collection of them. So um there's this large and growing field that we call neural engineering that is really trying to use computers uh sensors chips in order to interpret eavesdrop on how the neurons are signaling to each other regardless of their you know pathology or the biology but just what are they saying to one another. Can we eaves strap on that? Can we interpret it? Can we decode it?

[00:47:54] And then more importantly, can we use that information actually to guide, you know, sort of more normal signaling. Uh why this is potentially important is that at the end of the day, the function is from that electrical activity. It's the propagation of those action potential by neurons which gives rise to our thoughts, our ability to communicate, our ability to walk, move our arm. Um without that, it's not there. So um I would say neuroengineering as a complement to the biological or pharmaceutical approaches.

[00:48:28] Eddie, if you and I were mapped simultaneously together and uh and this question might not even make sense, so please feel free to adjust the question to make it logical. But I think you'll understand what I'm trying to ask. Um, somehow all of the electrical activity of my brain could be mapped to a computer and the same could be done with yours and we were thinking the same thing. So, it was an experiment where we were both told to think the same thing.

[00:48:56] Uh, Peter, Eddie, we both want you to think about sitting on a beach with your feet in the sand. It's hot. Like, what as descriptive as you want it to be, would the out would the outputs on the computer screen be similar? Would the computer be um able to appreciate similar electrical output or could two people that are doing the best job they can to have the same thoughts not be able to produce that? In other words, is there a onetoone map of thought to electrical activity?

[00:49:25] Short answer is actually both. Okay. So in that example that you gave um if both of us are looking at the same picture of a scene on the beach um yes the same part of our brain is going to be processing those images in the very back of the brain that we call the cipital lobe. The primary uh visual cortex is going to be parsing that space into what we call retinotopic space like essentially you know where those different pixels are located in the image. um that part is going to be highly conserved, not identical but highly conserved between your brain and mine. It's where these computations go further upstream where they become much much more differentiated, much more specific to our brain. much more dependent actually on our history and our thought um you know um history of thoughts uh our personality you know everything that's interacting with the rest of the brain. I'll give you a great example. Um the way that you may hear

[00:50:35] Spanish or French or German is going to be very different than someone who is a native speaker of those languages. Right? Your brain is going to process some of those sounds. You'll hear them, but you're not going to be able to pick out the words very easily. Or the way I hear an engine versus the way my wife hears an engine. I I love the sound. She's mildly annoyed by the sound. We're hearing the same thing.

[00:50:58] Absolutely. Yeah. So um so there are parts that are going to be very similar like how we process some of the sensory attributes and then the further you go deep into the system the more it's becomes like very very tailored uh some of this is hardwired right like the way that our visual system early on is um a lot of it is hard wiring it's heavily influenced by what we see is you know if so seeing a snake should automatically produce a negative response that doesn't have to be learned. In theory, I assume evolution has probably hardwired us for that.

[00:51:35] There are some things that are instinctual. Um, certain odors would be we'd be hardwired not to like things that are going to smell rotten or something like that. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. There's a lot of those things that are very intuitive. And and now going back to the the we're showing you the picture of the beach. How much do you change over time? So, if we did that experiment when you were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

[00:51:58] Yeah. Would that also change? It will change but less. Yeah. And um I think over time these things become refined and over time actually lose their refinement. So as we age some of those representations actually become less clear. Uh if we talk about hearing for example um there are a lot of people in the population over time it's very hard for them to be in in a crowded restaurant where there's a lot of background noise competing conversations going on. Um and yet these individuals can have perfect hearing.

[00:52:32] So signal processing is becoming the problem. That's exactly right. It's not an ear problem per se. It's a perceptual problem and largely in the brain and that has to do with how that information you know how how like the fidelity is that a harbinger of something bad. It's independently no but we do know that when people have that problem they tend to be more socially isolated. So there's a lot of secondary things that happen. We do know that when people have hearing loss and it's unrecognized, a lot of people have unrecognized hearing loss.

[00:53:07] Y and what people don't fully appreciate is that if you don't have access to communication, to conversation, you're not your brain is not getting those same signals. It's becoming deprived. And what we do know through many studies now is that the cognitive effects of that hearing loss actually can be quite profound. It accelerates uh age related memory loss.

[00:53:35] Yeah, we we actually internally in our practice believe that that is causal um to cognitive decline. Now there was a study that came out about 2 years ago that suggested it wasn't. Although the study had a partial retraction, the methodology was a little flawed. But to my knowledge, I don't know if it's been repeated. The question being, of course, is if you correct uh hearing loss, let's say you randomize a group of people with early MCI and you correct hearing loss, do you correct or prevent or reverse it?

[00:54:06] And and again, if there's causality there, you would expect that you would. Um, what about with visual? You know, as people get older and they develop cataracts or things of those nature, um, and their visual acuity goes down, does it have the same effect on depriving them of, uh, enough neural stimulation to to maintain or is it not as much because it's not a language issue?

[00:54:30] It's not as much. Yeah. and I'm less aware of the you the prevalence of something that's age related just in the visual cortex for example. So let's go back to to to brain computer interface. What would be how would you explain this to somebody at a party if they said but it would you know that that that sounds pretty high-tech but what is it?

[00:54:50] Okay. Um well um okay so let's just break apart the terms. Uh brain refers to really any kind of thing that interfaces with the cortex or the deeper structures. Uh the computer is a digital device on the outside. Um a lot of people now call this BCI, brain computer interface for short. Um it's a very messy term um because it could mean a lot of different things but I think in a nutshell what it means is for most people a system that is recording from the brain whether it's non-invasive from the scalp or something that's fully invasive like within the brain itself and connecting those signals to a computer that analyzes the signal and then does something with it. In many cases of uh BCI research, the application is uh for example to remove a computer cursor or uh in the research that we've done is to replace speech words for someone who's severely paralyzed and unable to talk anymore.

[00:56:00] And so it's about interpreting brain signals and then using a computer to um interpret those signals and then um transform them into a form that's useful to us. So in that example you gave, you're describing a patient with aphasia who can't speak. Let me be very specific about that. So a lot of the work that we've done is on people that have a severe form of paralysis. And aphasia we typically I see refer to as someone who's got let's say a stroke.

[00:56:28] Yep. um in the language centers of the brain. Um where we've focused recently is on patients that have a severe form paralysis like ALS. So there the problem is they have largely normal language but they can't get those can't get the motor signal out. Can't get the motor signal out to the vocal tract, the lips, the tongue, the jaw, the larynx.

[00:56:51] Those descending fibers are severely affected by ALS. They degenerate. Yep. And that's why people progressively become paralyzed and lose ability to speak. And an important part of that is that they lose ability to speak, but they still have full cognition. Yeah. And for that individual, by attaching a computer to their brain, you're able to hopefully extract in written cursive text, you know, whatever across the computer screen what they're wishing to say. That's right.

[00:57:27] Okay. Let's talk about how that could possibly be done. Um, you mentioned earlier there are at least two broadly, you know, two broad ways to extract that information. A non-invasive way where presumably you're putting electrodes all over a head that's as well shorn as mine. Um, alternatively, a very invasive way where you actually remove the scalp and you lay these things on the cortex itself.

[00:57:53] Correct. Yeah. So the range would be EEG which is where sensors are placed on the scalp directly recording non-invasively. You can remove them at any time. And then the far other extreme is uh electrodes that are actually placed into the brain. The most ECG um ECOG would be electrodes that are on the brain surface. That's short for electrocorticography. And that's where we've done the vast majority of our work in my lab. And that's just placed on the surface of the cortex under the dura on the cortex.

[00:58:27] That's absolutely correct. Yeah. Okay. So, what's nice about that is that you don't have um the injury to the brain itself from the insertion of the electrodes. Um it's a stable recording over time. We now use ECOG devices to essentially help people with seizures, for example, where you can basically have a pacemaker now that records from the brain service and then stimulates to help stop the seizures. Um and this is a fully implanted device.

[00:58:55] Um it's moving towards that. So the work that we've done in our clinical trial is using an array that's surgically placed but connected through uh a port. We call it a perccutaneous port because it's actually physically attached uh and anchored to the skull. It's an array on the brain. It comes out the dura and is anchored in the skull.

[00:59:18] Um and then where does the port exit the body? uh right on the top of the scalp. How do you prevent infection with such a close? Yeah, it's a really good question and that's what the main problem with this early prototype um BCI and it's our group. There's other groups around the world that are using similar things primarily to show if you know it's possible actually to decode brain activity for uh useful purposes. So what's happening right now in the field is a lot of these technologies are now going to become wireless over time. But you're absolutely right. One of the main reasons is that we want to move away from the perccutaneous. We want to move away from the ports which are infection risks uh on top of other problems and uh move to things that are fully implantable uh fully wireless.

[01:00:07] How long do you feel you're away from that? Um basically about a year. Oh, okay. Yeah, we've been working on it for uh for quite some time. And so um it's a really interesting time where we're seeing a convergence of like what's possible with electrical engineering, you know, high bandwidth wireless way beyond what we can do with Bluetooth. Um uh advanced electronics that now allow us to print some of these sensors on a substrate that is thinner than a piece of paper, really really small. and on a substrate that can conform to the convolutions um you know the different um peaks and valleys of of the you know human cortical surface.

[01:00:50] So what is the trade-off between ECOG and sensors inserted directly in the brain? Yeah. What's the resolution difference? Um well that's a very important question that we and many other people are trying to figure out right now. Um most of the time when people are putting an electrode into the brain um there has to be some gain for that and usually that's for recording a higher resolution usually trying to record the activity of single neurons a single cell.

[01:01:25] H how how can you isolate a single cell? Yeah. Really small electrodes. Super small electrodes. Um and that's we we do a lot of work with this in our research. The challenge for the field um is just been that it's very hard to stably record from single cells more than a couple of hours or days. So that's one challenge. The other pro challenge is that when you put the electrodes into the brain, it can create a reaction. um those gal cells that we talked about at the very beginning, those support cells, they actually have immune function as well, they detect that there is a foreign body and they'll activate and they'll react to it, create a scar around the electrodes. So the advantage of having electrodes in the brain to do this very microscopic kind of recording is that you can get a finer signal from single cells. The disadvantage is that it can create a reaction that reduces the fidelity of those signals over time.

[01:02:28] One of the reasons we've been most interested in using these sensors on the brain cortex is that we've learned over time that if you don't have the electrodes penetrating through the peel surface of the cortex, that's the outermost um very thin membrane that's covering the cortex. If you don't have anything going through that, you can avoid a lot of those immune reactions, avoid a lot of that scarring, preserve the function uh that's underlying. But this is something that we're actively trying to understand. So just to give me a sense of magnitude, if

[01:03:02] EEG on the surface is one one unit of resolution, what would ECOG be? And what would uh implanted electrode be? Is it 1 10 100? What what's the scale at which you're thinking about resolution? Well, I would say uh from the scalp, let's say we just arbitrarily call that one. Yep. you know, and then you think about what you could do with the CEC.

[01:03:28] I think we're really talking about, let's say, you know, a thousand times better resolution. We've been a able to answer very fundamental questions actually about how the brain works using those kind of surface recordings in a way that's impossible with surface uh scalp electrodes. Wow. And then once you go take that further to single neurons, then you've got another resolution probably six to five uh five 5,000. So there is a benefit.

[01:03:55] So the big jump is just going from an EEG to an ECOG directly. That's a three log change whereas you're a 5x change going deeper. And so um one of the reasons for that is the skull and the scalp uh are a major loss of signal. Yeah. um the signals are small to begin with. So once you're trying to interpret them through the scholar scalp, they're basically gone and very diffuse too.

[01:04:23] So trying to understand like where they came from in any precise way is almost impossible. Um when you're recording directly on the surface, you're basically at the source itself. Um the cellular level, the single cell recordings are terrific for trying to understand that ultra fine resolution primarily uh in in the case that we use them for is for research primarily to understand, you know, what's happening at those units. But still to this day, there's really no way that you can chronically and stably record from the same cells, you know, over uh days because of the immune reaction. Um, also because of how fine uh of a problem it is, like how um precise it has to be.

[01:05:08] Um, we're talking about a single cell, you know, a couple of microns in uh diameter and you've got an electrode. Any microotion at all, anything changes that. And so typically what we see with a lot of those systems that record from those is that there's a lot of turnover from day to day or hour to hour.

[01:05:27] Meaning you're drifting between which neuron you're recording in. That's exactly right. Yes. But does that imply then that I mean just taking a step back you said 82 billion neurons in our brain. So you put the probe into one and it moves over to the next one and the next one and the next one. one like me would naively assume they're all the same. Like, you know th those are like three row homes that are basically all identical on the upper west side. Like that's we're not talking about Tribeca here.

[01:06:02] Does it really matter if the probe moves between those three? Um, sounds like the answer is yes, but I'm curious as to why. The the answer is yes. Um, and because we we now know that, you know, cells that are right next to each other can have some very different information. Now that being said, when you go through a column of the cortex, a column is this vertical organization.

[01:06:26] Um, typically what we we're thinking about when we look at is the two dimension of the surface. But there's a third dimension of information processing, which is the different layers of the cortex, we call the lamina. And typically in some of the sensory areas, for example, if you put an electrode, it's primarily going to be tuned to the same information across those different neurons across that depth. So you're right, in certain areas, you may have neurons that are tuned to the exact identical thing. And for decoding purposes, that may actually not be a big deal to have it not, you know, not very stationary over time. In other instances where you're trying to code from areas where it's a lot more intermix, it could have really profound implications where you have to recalibrate the algorithms that the machine is doing to interpret the signals, you know, every couple of hours or days.

[01:07:17] So when you do ECOG, how do you direct the sensor at the part of the brain you want to go to? Because I assume it has to be far more nuanced than just where you slap it on the cortex. Yeah. Um, we're definitely getting into details and I love that Peter about you. Um, you're not afraid of getting into the details. And so, um, this is one of the actually the, um, alludes to one of the things we were talking about earlier.

[01:07:46] The part of my brain and the part of your brain that is responsible for speaking, especially in the motor control part, is largely the same. It's in the same ballpark. Um, there's a lot of variation when we come down to the details. the micro geography, but it's in the same it's like largely in the same city if we're talking about geography. Um, where your house is versus my house, etc., that's going to be a little bit varied within that. Um, one of the nice features about using ECOG or electrocortography is that you can put an array over that entire area safely and you can sample very very densely across the other, you know, across the entire city, let's say. And so it doesn't really matter actually at the end of the day if one person's there and the others. Um, that seems to actually be a feature, not a bug, right? I mean, the bug is you give up the resolution at what's happening in the kitchen of that house, but you now get to look at all the houses.

[01:08:50] Exactly. And you get to do it in a way that's very safe and scalable. And you're only I mean, the biggest thing you give up is 20 You give up 80% of the resolution roughly. But yeah, so with ECOG, tell me how many words per minute you could capture from a patient with ALS. Okay. So, um, what we did in our clinical trial at UCSF, was this the 2023 paper?

[01:09:22] Yes. Okay. This is the Nature paper. That's right. So, we published a paper in 2023. Uh we worked with an a participant named an um she had a very severe brain stem stroke about uh 20 years ago. How old was an? She was in her 20s. Um it wasn't long after she had gotten married. actually um just a couple months after her second daughter was born. She was playing volleyball with her friends, collapsed, uh taken to the hospital.

[01:09:57] Uh she survived the injury. She was it a vertebral artery. Yes, that's exactly right. Yeah. Okay, Peter, you're you're they're very This is just your memory from medical school is actually pretty good. This is impressive. Um, but back to Ann. Yeah, absolutely devastating. Okay, so just so people understand, vertebral artery, everyone's heard of the corateed arteries. Okay, the corateed arteries come up through our neck and they primarily give the blood flow to the front part of the brain. The vertebral artery is an equally if not more important set of arteries that supply the brain stem which connects the brain to the spinal cord uh in the back of the brain. So we have these two pairs of really important blood vessels that come to our brain, the corateed and then the vertebral arteries. and Ann had an injury uh while she was playing um and it was really just unfortunate but she had this stroke in the vertebral artery that blocked the blood supply to the brain stem. So functionally what this means can I ask a naive question um does it have to be bilateral to cause the injury or if it happens on one side can the other side not profuse around the circle of Willis why why does that injury happen?

[01:11:20] Yeah. Um just to be even more precise about this, unlike the corateed artery, the vertebral arteries you have a left and right vertebral artery. They come up through your neck and then they go through the um the base of the skull through the framan and magnum. It's essentially where the spinal cord is coming through the base of the skull. Um when they enter the skull, they become one artery.

[01:11:47] It's called the basler artery. and the baselor artery and the small perforating arteries that come off that supply the brain stem are absolutely critical. So it depends where the dissection occurs. If it occurs before the bifurcation you're probably fine. If it occurs above the bifurcation or the where they join it's not the bifurcation but yes yeah actually you're right like there are many cases in fact sometimes we for various reasons actually have to olude a vertebral artery um and then the other one just collateral you know it gives the collateral flow so um um the basler however doesn't have that kind of transmission critical doesn't have that insurance policy no backup right um and so it's such a critical structure Sure. And when there's a problem there, it's usually actually like terminal.

[01:12:38] Yep. Uh Ann survived this stroke. Um she was left quadriplegic, meaning she couldn't move her arms and legs. Um but in addition to that, she couldn't speak. um because the nerves that come through the brain down through the brain stem and go to the cranial nerves which supply the vocal tract, those were also directly affected.

[01:13:05] And yet, just again, you'll have to pardon my profound ignorance, those would be lower cranial nerves. That's right. So the So the three, four, five, the ones for the diaphragm were intact, so she could still breathe on her own, but what is it? 7 8 n would have been compromised which is why she couldn't speak or something in that neighborhood.

[01:13:28] Yeah, it's not really the um it's the cranial nerves in particular around uh the lower ones. Okay. And those distributions that allow um the control of the tongue that's the hypoglossal nerve that's number 12. Okay. It's uh number 10, the vagus, you know. Um but it's not precisely the nerves. It's actually the brain stem nuclei where they where the nerves originate.

[01:13:51] That's exactly right. And that's not something one predicts from any type of stroke. It's simply the nature of where what part of the brain stem was affected. That's exactly. And was the paralysis a result of her cerebellum also having infarks? No. No. It was all brain stem related. Brain stem. Yeah. Precisely the part that we call the ponds.

[01:14:10] Yeah. So um Yeah. So devastating. Devastating. So it's for 20 years an is now in her 40s un in a wheelchair unable to speak. Right. So um I think some important things about this are that um it was actually about 18 years after her stroke that she decided to participate in our trial and we had talked actually a year earlier.

[01:14:40] She said, "I really want to wait to participate in this trial because um I want to wait until my daughter graduates and then I can do this with you guys." And I assume she said that because the risk of something catastrophic happening was high enough that she felt she needed to wait. Well, she's a mom. Yeah. You know, um and she wanted to be there for her daughter and um you know, she had a year before the graduation and she reached out to us because um we had an earlier participant also with a brain stem stroke that we treated that we did this trial that I'm about to describe uh and she read about it and so she reached out to us and and how did she communicate at that point in time?

[01:15:19] Yeah, so the main way that she communicates is through uh devices that can track her eye movements. M um those are translated to a pointer that can point on a screen to individual letters or words. And so it's a very painstaking way of communicating. Um one thing I've learned about Ann is she's just a tremendous person. Uh positive person.

[01:15:43] Um she's just a force of nature, you know. Uh she recently actually used uh that same system to write a book chapter. Um just incredible. Okay. So, we started this trial called the Bravo trial. It was um something that we worked with the FDA very closely to get approved because it requires a brain surgery. It requires this perccutaneous port that we talked about. Um the reason we were able to get it approved in this form was that a lot of the components that we were using were actually existing medical materials. So the safety of it was largely already known in terms of its biocompatibility, its biostability. Um what was not known is that if someone has not spoken for a decade or two whether or not those parts of the brain actually would still work.

[01:16:40] Yeah. It's really interesting because we know that if a person loses their sight for x number of years, I'm guessing that the occipital lobe doesn't work the same way. It's not processing the information. So, it I don't know that it actually physically atrophies, but I'm guessing that it's not it's not the neurons aren't firing the same way. Right.

[01:17:09] That's right. So what would be interesting is we just don't know if An's inner monologue is still happening right the same way right or yeah that's a very interesting question right and I think that ultimately that was uh the biggest risk actually um there's a lot of emphasis like on the technology but the basic biology of how the brain works and um whether that information is still being processed

[01:17:40] I think are really the more important ones actually. And so um what we did was we did a surgery where we implanted an array of 253 ECOG sensors. These are the sensors that are densely spaced. How many? 253. So, we're talking about something about the surface area of a credit card and it's filled um with electrode sensors that are spaced about 3 mm apart.

[01:18:12] Each sensor is about a millimeter in diameter. And so basically you've got this credit card sized array that was placed on the part of our brain that processes words in particular the motor production of the words. The parts that control the lips, the jaw, the larynx, the tongue. Um areas that um were functionally disconnected from her vocal tract because of this stroke in the brain stem which connects the brain to those muscles. And so um um we did the surgery about uh 3 weeks later. We started our research sessions with her.

[01:18:58] We connected the uh cable. It's basically an HDMI cable that is attached to a head stage. The head stage transforms the analog signals from her brain. These are a small voltage. Yeah. Can you maybe not to get I know I getting into the weeds a bit much, but I think it's kind of interesting in signal processing.

[01:19:21] Can you explain why the brain is analog and why you have to convert that to digital? Yeah. Uh it's a good question. Um well to some degree there is a level that it is digital. Like when we talk about action potentials are digital single neurons action potentials like firing yes or no that's like a digital form but um when we're recording a lot of these especially at the ecog it's an analog it's looking at the average of these from a population of let's say you know a couple thousand of those neurons activating and uh the work that we've done actually over the last decade and a half which led up to this using methods like eco TG we've learned from that there's a map what we alluded to in the very beginning like the homunculus but a mini homunculus that is corresponding to those parts of the vocal tract the larynx the tongue the jaw we figured out essentially how those signals correspond to every consonant and vow in English you know about about a decade ago and actually that was the um impetus for actually starting this clinical trial was that we essenti had identified what the neural code was like, what part of the brain, and how that neural activity corresponds to all the movements that create, you know, syllables. For example, how big a data set was required to create that knowledge?

[01:20:46] Probably about 36. That's incredible. Participants data, you know, to just get the basic idea of the world. And is this something where if that were 36,000 it would be how much better almost hopefully perfect like near perfect what we're talking about um let's let's get to that we'll get to that because um that's where things are going right like how does this scale how do we use the information from other individuals to help N of one for example um but in ant's particular case we started from the beginning we actually didn't use that data we knew that it possible. We knew what the nature of that data and that code would look like. And then at the same time that we're doing all of this research, Peter,

[01:21:36] AI is developing in parallel. Yeah. Okay. So all of these tools that we now are using every day, transcribing our voice right now into text, um we use that technology. We can actually use those same technologies that generate voices called uh uh speech synthesis. And so we've used a lot of the same tools, machine learning tools that are in modern day AIS and we're now applying them on the brain activity and trying to use them to not translate, for example, text and synthesized speech.

[01:22:20] But now the equation is different. It's translating from brain activity into synthesized speech. The input is not text. The input is the ecog activity. across these 253 sensors, which of course is the logical extension. Um, but just if you ignore the cost of compute, is there an advantage to doing it that way because you take out an intermediary step?

[01:22:48] Yes. Yeah. Um, it's because we know that the ballpark is there, but we know that everyone's brain at that detail level. Like, if you're going to reconstruct their words, you can't just be in the ballpark. You have to know basically like what each leaf of grass on that ballpark is doing. And that's highly variable across individuals.

[01:23:12] So, what is AI? I'm just trying to think about what the machine has to do. What is its training set? How does it know? Yeah, walk me through. I'll walk you through. So, the way that we train the algorithm, um, the way that we started this was we would give an prompts on a screen in text and basically we would ask her to try to say it. So the value of that is we know can she move her lips?

[01:23:48] She can move a little bit but she can't speak. So she can move her jaw, her lips but none of it is intelligible. She has what we call anarria basically she can vocalize a little bit but none of it is intelligible in any form. I see. But if her inner monologue, if you if you put up the word, the cow jumped over the fence and she says, and in her mind the signal is the cow jumped over the fence, then I totally see how it works. Yeah.

[01:24:16] At that point, you have infinite training data. You would basically just have her read war and peace, right? So, let me just clarify. the the area that we are decoding from is not the part of the brain that is processing either inner monologue or reading. Uh it really is this part that is about this voluitional intent.

[01:24:37] Oh, that's such a good point. Speak, right? So it's not about her perception. So when I'm reading the cow jumped over the fence, but I'm not if I just go, what part of my brain is internalizing the cow? Visual cortex. Yeah. And then as it goes further, it's going into some of the language areas, but it's not necessarily activating the lips, jaw, and the larynx, you know, the areas that are paralyzed, right? And so we're tapping into a part of the brain that is really

[01:25:05] So this is a hard exercise. This takes a lot of effort on her part, a lot. So let me describe actually what that was. So for days, what we would do is have a sentence on a screen and we'd give her the start time and the end time. And during that, she would just look at the sentence. She's given a go and then try to say it. Nothing intelligible comes out. She may or may not be moving the lips jaw, but just try to say. And that turns out to be very important.

[01:25:37] Oh my god. Like you can't just think about it. You can't just read it. Wow. You have to actually try to say it. and um and that's what she did. Um so we started with a very simple vocabulary of about 27 words. Um the the words that we chose are the NATO code words. Alpha, bravo, charlie, delta, echo.

[01:26:05] Um we did that because um we could measure basically the accuracy of the decoder that was analyzing those brain signals and translating them into those 26 different code words. And on the first day we were able to train the algorithm on you know a data set of like maybe about an hour and a half to get to about 50% accuracy. And does 50% accuracy mean she could get half of them right or any time you showed her one there was a 50% chance it would be correct?

[01:26:44] Both. What you just said is in our sense identical. Okay. Like so she's looking and then trying but there wasn't a bias towards a subset of them that she was always getting right and others that she was always getting. There actually was a bias. Um yeah actually if I get into details yes some of them were more discriminable than others and was it based on the number of syllables could you okay yes actually it was based on that in uh some of the phonetic properties but one of the reasons why NATO code words for us was a really useful training training task for us is because NATO code words were developed in the first place by the military to improve communication accuracy. The reason why we actually use those code words is because sometimes if you just say a B, you know, like D Z, there's a lot of confusion. So that's why we actually use those code words. It increases the discriminability and intelligibility where a lot of those settings you just can't make those errors. For example, you know, pilots.

[01:27:47] Yep. You know, uh in the call numbers, for example. So um we use that because um it has high discriminability and on that first day um you know I think we got about 50% and you this is going straight to voice. No, this was actually this is going straight this is going to text. This is straight to text. Yeah.

[01:28:06] And so we're just trying to figure out could we um decode which word it was and it was displayed in text. Um so that's pretty amazing. That's the first day 50%. That's the first day. Yeah. And then over the next I would say about six days uh the performance just got better and better and then by about you know like a week into this she was up into the 95 100% range. Um so that was um unexpected.

[01:28:38] Um it was incredible to see the performance increase you know so quickly. But that did take a full week to do that. Let me ask a question now. And I'm sure that the NATO code is not designed for this purpose, but presumably one could concoct a series of words that contain within them the full range of um of tones of um phonetics of syllable juositions that would allow you to use the smallest possible training data to get the largest possible outcome. Does that make sense?

[01:29:22] Absolutely. And do you have a sense of what that would like? How would one even develop such a thing? Because this is a novel problem, right? Um it's actually a a really important and more profound actually than you may realize. Um what you're referring to is the generative property of speech and language. And what I mean by generative is that you can take these individual elements like consonants and vowels which by themselves have no meaning at all.

[01:29:47] Yep. And give rise to all possible meaning from just different combinations of them. Just like DNA DNA we've got four base pairs essentially as a code for all of life. Except DNA is so much easier because it's finite. Mhm. And the rules are always the same. You can define all the rules. Yeah. Here you have so it's it's there's only four base pairs and they can only combine in two ways and everyone has a onetoone mapping with what it's going to become. Here you have 26 letters. They can combine in a near infinite ways and then there are all these dumb exceptions.

[01:30:30] Right? So that's where the AI actually comes in. So let me let me just explain a little bit about how the algorithm works. Um because what you asked about actually is very very much at the heart of the way that we do this. So we don't go from the brain activity directly to speech and words and sentences. In the very beginning with the NATO that's what we do. You can use an algorithm called a classifier. It's going to look at the pattern activity and then just say, "Okay, it looks mostly like Beta.

[01:31:04] Another one looks mostly like Echo. Another one looks like Charlie." Okay, but to get to expressive normal speech, you need something that actually can open up much more combinatorial potential to generate sequences of syllables, words, and sentences. So what we did was we built a decoder that translates the uh brain activity patterns in very small segments like 10 to 20 millisecond little chunks of brain data.

[01:31:38] Really small signals, right? Like small windows of signals. And the machine learning is looking at those small windows and making an educated guess. How does the mapping of that brain activity relate to a given consonant or vowel? Now I'm using consonant vowel just because it's easy to understand. The reality is we used um a speech unit that am or something like that.

[01:32:05] A phone. Yeah. But actually something that was statistically derived from a speech recognition algorithm. Um it was statistically derived. It was not something that was linguistically or you know um that you read about. It's like really a computational unit that we know if you have aund if you can decode a 100 of these units you can generate fluent comprehensible speech. And so we used AI actually to derive what those units would be in the first place. We took a speech recognition system that Meta had made open source you know about five years ago. It's one of the leading speech recognition algorithms. We took uh essentially the neurons and what they do in that neural network and then we try to map those actually to the brain activity patterns. That's on the very front end. The first step of the decoding is translating the back the neural activity patterns to these individual speech units that are just 10 to 20 milliseconds long. And then it's of course knows the sequence of these units over time because it's part of the algorithm calculation. And we use something called a language model. Um which is something that all of us are now familiar with when you're texting.

[01:33:19] It autocorrects your speech. Why? Because it has got a model of English in there and that it knows what the particular sequence of the things should be like. And so even if a lot of the data data is kind of fuzzy, as more data accumulates, you get a sequence and then it can basically use a best guess over time, what we call a probabilistic inference of what was the most likely word or phone um at any given time point and ultimately we could construct sentences.

[01:33:48] Did you get a sense from an as to how her level of fatigue with this progressed? Um, in other words, what becomes the bottleneck? Is it does it get easier and easier for her to go through this talking motion as she practices more? Is it just like any other muscle that we think of that has sort of atrophied and now she's sort of getting her talking back in shape?

[01:34:14] It is a bit of that. And um, we're trying to make that easier over time. I think in the beginning days we were trying everything to get it to work and um a lot of it again has to do with this valitional intent to speak. That turns out to be the most critical thing. Peter, one of the things that I thought was really interesting also was we were doing so much um decoding through these tasks that over time, actually a couple months into this, and had reported to us actually the strength of her oral facial muscles, her jaw, the tongue, they were actually getting stronger through this constant therapy, constant rehabilitation. And so

[01:35:01] I think right now everything is about just decoding the brain activity, you know, to an artificial digital thing. But I do think that in the future BCIs are also going to be a way that we can do rehabilitation, right? Like it's a way that we have this direct readout of what the brain is trying to do. you can essentially build a prosthetic that helps people speak, but in the process, someone who hasn't spoken for a while will regain some of that natural strength over time. So, that's a new indication that we're thinking about in the future, how to use this technology actually to augment and accelerate rehabilitation.

[01:35:38] If Anne had that stroke today, how different, if at all, would this process look if you were working with a person who hadn't spent 20 years or 18 years without speaking? There's no question that I think it would work faster. There's less to learn. You know, for her not speaking for 18 years basically meant that she basically had to relearn how to speak and we had to keep up with her relearning. Her brain was probably reorganizing, relearning actually some of those fundamental things and she could see the feedback of essentially whether or not she what she was trying to say was right or wrong.

[01:36:24] Um, and it was very intense work. So, we're trying to make that easier over time. Um but I think certainly the more preserved, the more recent you know that activity is uh those memories, the synapses we talked about earlier, the more stable, the more functional they are, the easier it is to actually decode them.

[01:36:46] So what will be the ceiling for the current technology? How many words per minute and at what resolution or accuracy do you think the current technology with because this was ECOG in her case correct right um where do you think it's going to go where do you think it where will this asmtote we're seeing a lot of progress in this field at the same time or soon after what we were doing there were other groups that basically could see similar effects uh ours was primarily from the brain surface other groups close colleagues of mine were able to now do this with electrodes that were inside the brain you see using these intracortical arrays so it seems that it's possible with different approaches

[01:37:34] I think what is going to be a key question is you know what's going to be the right form moving moving in the future for many patients um with an we were able to get about 80 words per minute on average so sometimes much faster than that by comparison, how many words can you and I speak comfortably? Like you and I are probably doing about 150 160 words per minute right now.

[01:37:59] Wow. So she could speak at half the rate you could speak at. That's pretty amazing. Yeah. And it's not like the speech was coming out super slow. It's just that there's this built-in latency time that we used to translate the brain activity into those words and sentences. And what we published in 23.

[01:38:17] Yeah. you you had a very short latency in your more recent paper, didn't you? That's exactly right. So, in the 23 paper, our decoding strategy was to take this sequence of decoded phonetic elements. And we we we could look at that sequence and then apply the decoding algorithm in the language model to reconstruct full sentences.

[01:38:41] And then we could even synthesize them in fact um and personalize them actually to her pre-injury voice. Um in a more recent study that we just published this year, we were able to do this in a streaming way with you know less than a second latency between each phonetic element. So, it's not like we're waiting for the whole sentence to occur, but we're doing decoding on the fly and it's intelligible and fast.

[01:39:07] And that will get the words up to what you think as quickly as she can try to say them basically. So, um, and this is all with the same hardware. This is with the same hardware, totally different algorithm. So, are there on the intraraanial hardware? Obviously, there's a big material science push to come up with the most immunologically inert substance possible. That's the that's your challenge there, right?

[01:39:35] Um, but with the ECOG, is there is there another hardware step function you're waiting for? Not really. I mean, I think the thing that's most exciting about this is that we have the technology now. We got to optimize it in the right form factor. I mean, I guess it's just moving to a fully implantable device so you don't have to deal with the infection risk.

[01:39:57] So, we need to have the array that um will have a lot more channels actually. So, last time I talked about a credit card size with 253. We'd like to have something that has 4x that amount of sensors. This seems completely achievable when you think about what Nvidia is doing or TSMC. I mean, that that strikes me as very solvable, right? it is and we are doing it right now and um with any medical device you got to put it all together and make it you know improve it. So um we've taken these components that have very high bandwidth wireless connected to this array um and I think in many ways we've done the hard part already like what Ann did what Poncho did he was one of our earlier participants um what Walter doing these are incredible people that were really the first people in the world actually to be able to achieve this uh real pioneers that was the hard part the hard part is was like the first time.

[01:40:57] Yeah, for sure. It's the proof of concept. It's the proof of concept. Everything now is actually just about optimization to be honest with you. Do you think of this more as an engineering problem now? It is. Yes. So, let's now expand it. Right. So, you've you you have the proof of concept for the engineering problem that says brain works, motor system doesn't work.

[01:41:21] We can extract speech. What about these other problems that we talked about at the outset? What about ALS? Right? Not for speech, but for respiratory function, right? So, a patient with ALS is I assume it's I I don't actually, believe it or not, know much about it, but I assume that they ultimately succumb to respiratory complications and and whether it be aspirations or things like that. So, so if we could if we could overcome that problem and bypass the degenerative motor neurons, is there an engineering solution to ALS based on the type of technology we're seeing today? When we say solution, I mean to preserve communication for someone to preserve well I would say let's go even beyond the ability to talk but the ability to breathe normally for example like the ability and ultimately the ability to not lose motor function outside of the

[01:42:24] CNS. Yeah. So to do that basically is another couple of step functions in engineering where you basically are talking about bypassing a pretty significant like section of the nervous system. So you're going to tap into the brain to get some of the control signals. Some of this you don't even need to tap in the brain for breathing. A lot of it is like as you know um is um is wired. We're not thinking about it certainly. um central pattern generators in the brain stem for example are really important for that breathing pattern.

[01:42:58] Like this might sound naive Eddie but like why is it that we couldn't wire into all of the cranial nerves outside of the cranium and create a respiratory system that is fully automated like like almost think of an AIC right for the diaphragm and chest wall. Yeah. So we've spent almost all of our time really talking about the brain side, but then you can imagine another whole new enterprise and endeavor of building the electronics that not necessarily even tap into the nerves, the cranial nerves, let's say, or um the cervical nerves that go to the diaphragm. Um but you bypass those too and you go directly to the muscles.

[01:43:39] Yeah. Exactly. And so um there is a field we're not directly doing this research ourselves but it's highly related to where the future is. It's called uh fees functional electrical stimulation. So coupling the brain computer interface, the device that's decoding the brain activity, translating into the control signals and then actually acting on the muscles through stimulating um uh electrodes that are in the muscles themselves and and and doing that coordinated movement. Breathing actually is a really interesting one because it's not as complex as like let's say using our like restoring our hand.

[01:44:17] You know, it's interesting. Everybody assumes today, you know, if you if you really want to be in the forefront of technology, you need to be on the on the CS side, but the truth of the matter is you need just as much horsepower on the bioengineering side here. Electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering. I mean, these are material science. I mean, these are this type of problem is the intersection of everything that is high-tech from AI to computer science to all all disciplines of engineering coupled with medicine, right? I mean, you have to have a surgeon, too.

[01:44:48] That's exactly right. And I think that um you you hit the nail on the head because in many ways, that's the challenge actually more than the technology itself is really how do you get the engineer in the room with the neurosurgeon, with the neurologist, the neuroscientists, like all thinking in a really concerted way about solving this problem. Um and then what you're going to see in the future actually is that this is going to evolve more and more as a biological problem. Thinking about biology is the next technology solution. Engineered cells that are interfacing with the brain as opposed to you know metal electrodes. Um new ways of doing computing that are through biology that are not through semiconductors. You know that I think ultimately is where things are ultim you know are going to go in the future.

[01:45:37] Well say more about that. I mean, this is there there are some people that are already talking about this, but I'd like to I'd like people to understand more what you mean by that because it's it's complicated. Well, it is it is complicated. What I'm talking about really is a you know, I think the next couple of steps.

[01:45:53] Mhm. But um one one of the reasons why this comes up is that when you have these, you know, okay, you you you actually said it really precisely before. Okay, you've got this electrode system. Let's say you're recording from one cell. Best case scenario, you beat an electronic system that can maybe do 10, maybe 40 in the future, thousand channels, but the denominator is 86 billion.

[01:46:23] Right. Y like we're not in the scale. Yep. Right. Not in the same regime of scale. Um biology has done that all along. Biology has solved a lot of these scaling problems. Cells that have the same genetic programming, you know, multiply because of their environment, other factors. It becomes specialized for a specific function. That's how our brain is, right? Like each individual cell has the same genetic program, but because of its local maleu ends up having a different identity, different purpose. And so I think that is really you know thinking outside of the electronical engineering really moving into the realm of like bioengineering.

[01:47:10] Um and this field is moving pretty fast. You know there's a whole field that we call organoids. Um this is um creating mini brains from cell cultures or stem cells. um building miniature brains primarily being used as models of disease right now, but also as ways to test new drugs. Um but we're going to see these now interfacing with the world of uh brain computer interfaces. And so um I think that that's part of the future for sure.

[01:47:43] It's very exciting. um it's not like like near-term but um there certainly is something about the future of technologies actually in biology. What is your stretch goal for the field uh in 2030? So stretch goal meaning I define that as things have to go well but it's we're not talking science fiction. By 2030, I hope that we have these systems actually available to a much broader market. Like we have shown in a research setting, very controlled setting that this can be done. Um the proof of concept. What really needs to be done is a lot of hard engineering to make this practical, usable, useful for people like with a variety of different neurological conditions, not just ALS, but spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis. Um, and that's a challenge, right? Like everyone may have a very specific need. We need to be able to solve that. It is an optimization. It can be solved. That's what I'd love to see by 2030. Like just let's get a couple of these across the finish line so that they're actually out in the world helping people. Is there a current company or set of companies that are the natural owner to solving this problem based on their existing expertise or is what you're talking about basically new companies that have to be you know that have to become capitalized and do this denovo like uh yeah who who would be the natural owner of this?

[01:49:27] Well I think it's both. So um the most famous probably is Neuralink, Elon Musk, uh company that, uh has a very specific approach where you have a robot that is surgically inserting and sewing electrodes into the brain um and trying to record from that, you know, very finest resolution. And I think there's a lot of progress with that, but also we've seen a lot of challenges. It's a really hard technical problem to solve at that scale. Um there's a variety of other companies in that vein. Uh one of the things that we're working on is uh a highly customized ECOG approach because basically we already know that it works from a lot of the work that we've done and we can make it a lot higher resolution than we've done before um and make it much safer with a fully implantable system. Um, and then we're going to see more and more over time that this is going to become less and less invasive. Just like we were talking at the very beginning of our conversation, surgeries have become less invasive over time. Brain computer interfaces will become less and less invasive. Um, we're at the very beginning of this story. So like getting the most amount of data right now is the most important with highly invasive approaches, but I think as time goes on, we're going to back out from that invasiveness. That's always how things evolve to make it more generalizable, easier, and safer for people to do.

[01:50:54] Now, when you say less invasive, do you think there will ever be a day when you can do this off an EEG on the surface, or do you think no, it will be more like minimally invasive surgery to open surgery where instead of a cranottomy, we're going to bore a single hole in there, we're going to put a small tiny chip in, through the dura, implant it on there, and we're done. I think that there's some the latter.

[01:51:18] Okay. Okay. In other words, the resolution at the outside of the skull is probably never going to be good enough. We're talking about a physics problem that I think a lot of people have tried to solve. Batteries will never store energy nearly as well as hydrocarbons. Full stop. that level of resolution that we have from the scalp like you know in theory I think um but in practice no one has been able to crack that a lot of smart people have worked on that problem interesting um I do know that devices can continue to be miniaturaturized I know that surgery can continue to be safer so we will see this point in history where you know devices um at some point are not going to just be about medical applications. There'll be essentially, you know, enhancement level. There's huge ethical questions that we're going to have to deal with when that time comes. We're not there right now. Um, but I would bet on the technology, you know, because that we're not talking about breaking any rules and laws of physics in order to get there. We're just talking about scaling uh electronic or miniaturaturizing it in a way that is just a smaller form factor. But over time, everything becomes less invasive.

[01:52:36] So, I'm sure you get asked this question all the time, but going back to the origin of Ann's story, um, so many people suffer brain injuries, and if you could wave a magic wand, you would just hope for some regeneration of the injured portion of her brain. And my guess is in the case of an, the actual total volume of cells that are damaged is quite small. It could be this, you know, half the size of your thumb, right? I mean, it's a relatively small, but it just happened to be in the most precious part of real estate in her entire body.

[01:53:10] So, do we know or do you have any point of view on the potential future of stem cell like interventions for the purpose of uh regeneration specifically in the CNS? Yeah, I mean this is an area that I think got a lot of focus and attention maybe about 10 or 15 years ago and I would say largely the results were pretty modest.

[01:53:35] Yeah, at best. Um yeah, at best. Um it's coming back now because of a lot of cell-based therapies, organoids, um building miniature models of brains um on cell cultures basically. Um I think the first things that we're going to see and where I am seeing some promise is uh very focal delivery in replacing cells that have been lost in small targets of the brain. So back to

[01:54:05] Parkinson's disease where you've got degeneration of dopamineergic neurons and the substantia the goal is can you replace and basically transplant some stem cells into that part of the brain. Um, and remind me why the cells in the substantionigra go. Is it an autoimmune? Like what do we know what's killing them?

[01:54:27] I think there's a lot of um a lot of information. It could be multiple fold. It's partly genetic. Um there are certain genes that predispose to generation there. Um there's certain environmental toxins that can cause the degeneration and then there's like a huge bucket like we still don't know, you know, what's causing that. Um but at the end of the day there is a degeneration of those very specialized cells. Most of the treatments are around dopamine replacement right medications.

[01:54:55] And how close do you think we are towards um transplant? Well um it's already been done actually like 20 30 years ago. Oh really? I was using fetal uh graphs and they just didn't take um some of them took. In fact um patients some patients got benefit from it. The side effects were also fairly severe. Um there were a variety of different reasons.

[01:55:17] What kind of side effects? Um like if you have too much dopamine, you can actually get diskynesas. So hyper movement. So Parkinson, one of the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's hypo movement. Yeah. U bradicinesia specifically uh where you have slowed movements, slow to initiate movements as well. Um but if you have cells that are just pumping out dopamine, they can also be putting out too much and you get the opposite effect. So, it's not as simple as just putting them in there. They actually have to be tuned. Yeah.

[01:55:47] In the right way to put out the right levels. And so, there's a new generation of new therapies that uh we're really interested in trying UCSF um that are much better cell models, much better control of dopamine that's involved. We have much better delivery systems to make sure that the distribution and and um

[01:56:08] I mean, could you imagine that? Could you imagine engineering your way out of Parkinson's disease? We're working on it. What about synthetic cells where you completely get to control it, right? So again, you have the substrate problem, but if it's truly a synthetic cell, then presumably it can make dopamine as well.

[01:56:24] I mean, as opposed to an implantable sort of slow leak dopamine that you come up with some slick way to refill, but um what do you think is more likely kind of the the more pure engineering approach or the more biologic transplant approach where you just try to tune it? Uh the near term of course is taking some cell cultures that are not like purely synthesized. That's still I think is a huge goal outside of just brain like can you generate a cell denovo um without and does that require immune uh modulation?

[01:56:57] Oh absolutely. So it's a full transplant. Yeah. So a lot of these patients uh initially will be on imunosuppression for that but that's also improved a lot right like that's as immunosuppressive as if they had a kidney transplant or a liver or heart transplant. Yes. Wow. Yeah, but I think that's primarily right now at the level of precaution, you know, and there is progress being made in trying to make these things um as least immunogenic as possible.

[01:57:28] Um and that that's where a lot of the engineering actually is focused on is just make it um like the least amunogenic um to avoid a rejection scenario. So I am excited about that and that's some of the biological engineering that I was talking about like biotechnology or the future of technology be really coming back to the biology moving a little bit away from the uh electrical engineering.

[01:57:54] So in 15 years in 2040 um you know you're still going to be operating you'll you'll probably be in the final decade or 15 years of your career. So, you know, by a surgeon standards, plenty of plenty of work to do. What do you think the world looks like in 2040? Which major problems that stand in front of you today do you expect to fall and what will be the implications? I think that um at the course that things are changing and how many things are being unlocked right now, we're close. I think we're really getting close. Some of these things uh are not standard because of the side effect profiles or too severe but they can have therapeutic efficacy. We need to do that tuning this optimization there's a lot of proof of concept out there. Um but like I alluded to earlier before 99% of the work is in the optimization in that engineering. I do think that now that we understand what are the molecular and genetic drivers of a disease as devastating as glyopblasto, we will have way more powerful tools that will hopefully make it a chronic condition as opposed to a life, you know, a death sentence in 18 months on average. That being said, with surgeries, we can get out to years, many years. But a goal would be to make it chronic, potentially cure um by essentially attacking the mechanisms. We now know the genes that are altered. We need to be able to turn on the immune system to recognize huge amount of effort in trying to figure this out. I do think and I'm very optimistic around neurodeenerative disorders. Um there's just so many promising things between including the cognitive ones like

[01:59:46] Alzheimer's. Um, I think earlier diagnosis and earlier treatment is going to be the first thing where we're going to have, you know, the best effects, but that that is a really difficult one. But around Parkinson's where there's a focal Yes. problem, you can regenerate those cells. So, you're more optimistic on the movement disorders than you are the uh cognitive disorders.

[02:00:07] That's right. And partly is because um the target in the cell loss is very focal. We can get cells through a surgery. When we're talking about Alzheimer's, it's a bit trickier because um it involves multiple systems in the brain simultaneously. Um there are studies even using electrical stimulation in parts of the brain that are really important for encoding memory. You know, these things are promising, but I think for these really step functions that what everyone wants is to either stall disease or reverse it, uh it's going to take more time. But I do I do think the early detection is going to be a gamecher. a little off topic, but it's it's come up through the story of an do you have a point of view on things that place people at risk for vestibular artery dissections? Uh, for example, you know, for whatever reason, whether it's just a wives tail or not, I've always been afraid of having anybody ever adjust my neck for fear of uh, you know, having a vestibular artery dissection. Uh, is there any truth to that as a risk? Uh are there other things that people should be aware of given the low probability but very very high severity of such an injury?

[02:01:15] Um it's not a wife's tale. It's actually statistically proven that certain kind of chiropractic movements around the neck can cause an injury to the wall of the vertebral artery. And um that term dissection means that the wall of the artery has dissected. there's usually multiple um different layers to that vessel wall.

[02:01:40] What happens with the dissection is the the vessel is injured and then blood actually starts splitting the wall of the artery more up until the point where it becomes oluded and so uh it's a very very dangerous situation and like you said a critical part of the brain stem. So um generally we recommend you know like not severe aggressive movements you know but sometimes you can see it actually around sports um where you have a very high velocity uh movement around imposture around the neck you know and so those are the other cases where you can see it.

[02:02:18] That being said this is very low incidence like probability of of happening. So, um, it's not at the level that you could really tell people to avoid certain sports or anything like that. If, um, if we could bring Harvey Cushing back from the dead and you could have dinner with him tonight, what do you think he would say if he was, you know, if he saw what was going on in the field that he created? I think that there would be one part of him that is looking at some of the surgeries that we do or we're still doing cranottomies and Hugh would say, um, that looks pretty similar to what we did 150 years ago. Um, I think that's part of his genius. The fact that we still do it means that it still works and it's still safe, gets people through. Um, and a lot of that credit goes to Dr. Dr.

[02:03:15] Cushing. Um, but there will be things that I don't think he could have ever conceived. The way that we're retrieving blood clots that are reversing strokes, what we're doing with brain computer interfaces, um, you know, decoding brain activity, the substrate of thought to replace communication for people who are paralyzed. Um, I think that that would have been very hard to really imagine back then. um primarily because our knowledge was so limited and electronics was nowhere even close to being able to imagine what could be done now. So a lot of what we're seeing actually relies on technology that has evolved like artificial intelligence. A lot of the work that we did on decoding the brain just couldn't work even though we had a hardware you know like maybe 10 or 20 years ago um probably even earlier than that the decoding was not possible until this modern machine learning. And so these these things are just um accelerating very very fast right now. When I was um a resident, I used to have this very famous picture on my wall of the sort of um the five physicians who were sort of the founding physicians at Hopkins. So of course you had um Holstead in surgery and Oller in medicine and Kelly I think so I think Kelly was gynecology and then there was a pathologist and of course

[02:04:43] Cushing was the understudy of Holstead before he left for Harvard. And I honestly think if you could bring all of them back to life today to see how much each of their fields had progressed, I think that Cushing would be the one most blown away because and maybe I'm wrong and some historian will correct me, but I I really think that what we've talked about today is to your point unimaginable. Right. So, of course, Oller would see medications that he never could have conceived of, right?

[02:05:19] He could never conceive of a GLP-1 agonist and the profound effect it could have on weight loss. He could never conceive at the time that there would be a medication that could eradicate cholesterol. Um, let alone an injection once every six months that could do it. He he might have not even conceived obesity back then.

[02:05:39] That's a good point. Um although he was tasting urine so he certainly knew about diabetes. Um but yeah I think I think the mental leap to where we are although look maybe maybe the pathologist would have never imagined the genomic sequencing that we could do of tumors today right of course back then it was all hisystologology. So um it is amazing to me how much medicine has changed in a hundred years. And of course it doesn't take a leap to imagine that if we're still around as a species in a 100red years, the next hundred years is going to offer far bigger changes.

[02:06:18] Absolutely. I mean the pace of acceleration now is unprecedented. Um the underlying reason why I think Cushing would be the one that would be the hardest uh to understand what's happening now is because we are talking about the brain. We are talking about an organ system that we're just starting to fathom and put our round our heads around sort of the complexity.

[02:06:47] And for the last 150 years, neurosurgery has really actually been about how do you avoid injuring the brain? How do you take a tumor out of it? How do you deal with the plumbing, which is the the vascular system, the blood supply? Um, but if you think about it, like the biggest open-ended questions are really being addressed right now in the coming decades. How does the brain itself work?

[02:07:18] And then how do we tap into that to address a large variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions? The history of neurosurgery was actually primarily about trying to avoid injury, stay outside of the brain, etc. Now it's much more inwardlooking trying to understand actually how the system works, how the organ works. And it's a super exciting time because every time we unlock essentially a function of a certain part of the brain, there's a very high probability that there's going to be a therapy either through a brain computer interface or through a new biological approach. Every time we unlock a new mechanism, there'll be something that we can do to treat it.

[02:07:58] And um that's what you know the future's going to look like. You know, one of my hidden agendas of this podcast is to encourage as many young people as possible to go into medicine. And I understand that today medicine is not nearly as attractive a career as it was 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 50 years ago, and that the best and the brightest are typically going elsewhere. But but I think a podcast like this, as as are many of the podcasts I do with doctors, I think it I really hope it showcases that we need the best and the brightest to go into this. And again, this is not saying we don't need another brilliant person doing AI or investment banking or law or wherever else the top people go, but there is really an opportunity to bend the arc of civilization by choosing a career in medicine. And what you're doing, Eddie, is really on the forefront of that, especially the way it combines all disciplines of science, medicine, and technology. It's just it's super exciting. Thanks, Peter. Yeah, I'm really excited for that, too.

[02:09:00] Thanks for coming. I really appreciate this discussion. Thanks for having me. [Music]

## Transcript

[00:00:00] You can build a great body on six exercises. I just don't see any evidence that anything trumps exercise. >> 50% of Americans are not training or doing any kind of exercise. >> You don't know you're losing the battle until it's too late. >> Say a little bit about the programming. >> I know that it works and I know that it doesn't have to be hard and it doesn't have to be uncomfortable. >> Skeletal muscle health is really what we're talking about. >> Do you think that the average person appreciates the role of nutrition in that? The minimum amount of protein I would ever recommend would be 100 grams.

[00:00:30] Is not sex specific. It's body weight specific. >> Up until about 18 months ago, I was still squatting and deadlifting regularly, though with much less weight. I just sort of decided the riskreward trade-off wasn't there for me. >> You're not going to piggyback someone in and take a Like, that's not how it's going to work. In order to be able to use the bathroom, you only need to be able to bodyweight squat. >> Coaches want kids to specialize earlier and earlier. If you look at most of these people that are telling you that kids need year- round sports are people who are making their living from year- round sports. >> It's not like injury rates are going down. So, we're playing more and getting injured more. >> Is there something something significant that you've changed your mind on? And not just changed your mind on, but it's changed the way you behave. >> Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive

[00:01:10] Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. [Music] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for all making the trip out to Austin. Um, been looking forward to this one for a while. Um, as as some listeners might know, this is our second version of a roundt. But unlike the first one where um, I had interviewed the three guests multiple times previously and they were, you know, very familiar to the audience, um, all all three of you are people whose work I'm very familiar with, but

[00:01:46] I've never had the privilege of sitting down with you one-on-one. And as much as I would have loved to have done that first, I think it would have stood in the way of of doing this today. So before we jump into what we're about to talk about today, which is all things related to resistance training, um I want to just ask each of you to to maybe give the nonbio version of of who you are and and and as such why I think you're a great part of this. Let's start with you, Gabrielle. >> Certainly. Um well, my name is Dr.

[00:02:13] Gabrielle Lion and I'm a fellowship trained physician in geriatrics and nutritional sciences. I did my fellowship at WashU and at the time I was very reluctant to doing geriatrics because it can be a very arduous and sad experience. But I was fascinated by the nutritional research side. And there was a moment we were working on a study looking at body composition and brain function. And I really took to one of the participants and I imaged her brain.

[00:02:44] And at her mid-50s, she looked like the beginning of an Alzheimer's brain. And in that moment, um, muscle centric medicine, which is the concept that I practice and founded, was born. And it's really that skeletal muscle is the focal point of all our health and wellness. Uh, I'm an author, wrote a New York

[00:03:01] Times bestseller called Forever Strong. and uh I continue to do research and work within the space and um >> and you see patients. You're a clinician. >> I see patient. I have a medical practice. >> I do see patients and um we actually just submitted a paper that got accepted for a publication on sexual function, the relationship between sexual function and muscle mass. >> Okay, cool. >> Yeah. >> Mike, >> um Michael Bole. I'm a coach. I've been a coach. This is my 43rd year actually coaching. I was lucky enough to bounce right out of college and into a college job. I started out as an athletic trainer. When you said to be immodest, I think I invented training for the NFL combine, at least there's a book that says I did invent training for the NFL combine in the 80s. I worked in the NHL for the Boston Bruins in the '9s from 90 to 99 while I worked at BU cuz strength coaches were basically part- timerrs at that point. and worked at BEu for 30 something years, opened a business uh for profit, strength and conditioning, probably the first one in the United

[00:04:03] States in 1997. And then in 2012, I left be where I've kind of always had more than one job. And I jumped over to the Red Sox for two years and was able to get a World Series ring out of the Red Sox in two years. and then realized that that was not very conducive with being a what I really want to be a good father and a good husband and was like, "Okay, I'm done with pro sports." So now I I coach still coach my son and his friends. I have a son who plays college lacrosse and uh

[00:04:31] I'm still actually functioning as a personal trainer, I guess, in some cases and as a strength and conditioning coach in some cases. So I'm I'm more than anything just a practitioner. >> And what type of clients do you see now? What's the range? The range is 11 to in their 80s. So that's our that's our client range. We don't take kids till they're 11 because we really don't want them in the gym before that. And we'll take them as old as we can get them. But

[00:04:54] I think the oldest right now is uh is early. Actually, no, we 89. And that's actually my son's pediatrician just turned 89. Retired last year, believe it or not. Dr. Leer had still been working all those times. And he's one of we have a three we have a couple three generation families of which he's one.

[00:05:09] We have him, we have his kids, and we have his kids' kids that are all training in the same space. >> Good. Well, there a lot of things I want to talk about that are embedded in there, so we'll we'll come back to it. Um, and Jeff, >> um, I'm Jeff Cavalier. So, I'm a physical therapist by trade. Um, sort of moved out of the clinic at a at a early stage, um, and got a great opportunity to work in that role for the New York

[00:05:32] Mets. Um, which was a dream come true for me cuz I was a diehard Met fan growing up. It was like you know presented the dream job. Um and from there sort of piggybacked into how could I continue this education of athletes on a on a broader platform was well aware of the power of the internet at that time. So I started a YouTube channel which by luck beyond just my family members subscribing early on. And I got a few others that did along the way. And it sort of piggybacked that into a broader message, which was, okay, now it's not just about training athletes and empowering athletes, but how do I empower people who want to be more athletic, feel more athletic, move more athletically in daily life, not just in we're getting a pay to paycheck. So that became my my mission really from that point. Now, beyond having to sort of maintain a certain level of consistency because I want to practice what I preach, I also have two uh young boys. I started late uh 40 years old. I have twins and now I feel like I got to make sure I can keep up with them when they're ready to have me be able to run and play. So, I have a lot of motivation to keep doing what I'm doing and stay in the shape I am. But, I believe that it requires having an understanding of injury, training around injuries, because no matter what, as we get older, things do start to break down. And I think you have to have strategies to be able to push through that and train around that. And I think that's where my big strength is as a PT to provide that background to help people do that more readily. >> Let's start with a question that probably has an answer, although I actually am a bit embarrassed to say I don't know the answer. So I'm wondering if one of you guys do. Do we have a sense of what percentage of people in the United States do not practice resistance training? Well, we know that 50% of Americans are not training or doing any kind of exercise. I from the research that I've read up until recently, um it's probably 70% do not meet the criteria for both activities. >> 70% in total then or you think it's 70% of people who are doing some form of exercise. >> That's a great question. I believe that it is 70% of people in total. >> Got it. Okay. Does that I I can't even fact check that. It's I mean that's hard for me to imagine but I can believe it. >> I think it's lower in terms of if you're talking about resistance training because we were talking >> you would say lower than 30% would do resistance training then. >> Yeah. Because I think 20% of people belong to a gym. If we look at home gym stats aren't very good in terms of people there the home gym person who actually has one and uses it is is probably more unicorny than we think they are. And so if you start looking at that number, 20% have a membership. 50% of those people use it, which now brings us down to only 10% of people in the

[00:08:12] United States are actually in a gym. And then you look at that and say, what percentage of them are resistance training? Maybe now we're down to 5%, cuz you see a lot more hamster wheel people who are just walking on a treadmill or walking on a stair climber or whatever it is. So I would think the numbers are are pretty low. We spoke a little bit about this, but we have digital statistics that actually show people who have signed up to train with our programs, let's say, either be at home or at the gym, the percentage of people that make it through our programs is only 20%. And that's very high. >> Twice the industry standard for digital, which is usually like 10% or so. So, those are people who showed the commitment, made a purchase, put their hard-earned dollars behind it, have everything they need, I would think, in terms of the tools and sets and reps and what's supposed to be done, and only 10% will finish a program. So, I think that's that's a pretty remarkable statement on why why people can't. I think there's a lot more of a desire to to do things, but the the ability to actually follow through is where I think we're having a hardest time. So it might be then Gabrielle your stat is 70% of 50 be the reciprocal of that 30% of 5015.

[00:09:22] It might be that our range is somewhere from 5 to 15% if I were going to sort of triangulate between these three data points. Uh, again, that's that's kind of a hard thing to digest if you're asking the question um and and I've never been um sort of shy about my thesis, which is of all the pillars that we have um to embark on improving our health, whether it be changing our nutrition, improving our sleep, taking the medications and supplements that can be actually quite important. I I don't I just don't see any evidence that anything trumps exercise. um just purely from an actual lifespan perspective and from the standpoint of reducing the risk of chronic disease when you then layer in the benefits it has on quality of life.

[00:10:04] I mean it's just sort of a no-brainer. So what do you think and Mike I'm going to start with you because you've been at this the longest. What do you think explains the disconnect between the fact that we have this incredible tool that will lengthen your life, improve the quality of your life, make you look and feel better and yet 5 10 at most 15% of people engage in it?

[00:10:31] What are the barriers? >> I think the biggest barrier is just life, lifestyle, kids, jobs, people thinking you you really have to commit to is it getting there early? Is it going there after work? Whatever it is, it's adding hours to your day. I think that's probably the biggest barrier. In some ways, I guess that's economic, right? People don't have the economic freedom to say, "Hey, I can devote."

[00:10:51] That's why I laugh sometimes when I hear people talking about hours per week of exercise and hours per week of cardio. I just kind of snicker in terms of if I can get someone to do two hours a week and that's I like your guideline more of I think you said 75 hard minutes and I'm like 75 hard minutes now is realistic but even 150 minutes some of the guidelines are crazy and then there's a lack of awareness people you don't know you're losing the battle until it's too late that's what we see in our business we see people coming in and you think wow thank god you got here now at 50 or thank god you got here now at 55 because the end for you was going to bad. But you're and I'm not I'm not saying this to flatter you. I've been following you for a while and you know you and you are get like you're getting the message out in a way that it hasn't gotten out before because the message before was you know either geeky or nichy or whatever it was but it wasn't this hey this is really good for you and this is going to make you live longer and live better which double bonus right I mean you know you want to live longer but you don't want to who wants a a long shitty life excuse me I don't know if we're not supposed to swear but um >> we swear Okay, good. Okay. But do you know what I mean? Versus looking at it and saying, "Hey, I would like to live longer." And Jeff and I talked about this. I've experienced 50 to 65. And trust me, it's not fun. The decline is rapid and the decline is significant.

[00:12:14] And I think if people like, if you don't wake up by the time you're 50, you're going to be in real trouble by the time you're 65. >> Gabrielle, how much of a difference do you see between men and women on this front? Not from this standpoint, not from the economic standpoint, but from some other barrier to entry. Do you see differences between men and women who are who are um are new to resistant training? >> I do. And the first thing that I want to say is you're absolutely right. There's nothing more important for maintaining health and wellness than taking care of muscle health. Whether it's strength training, mobility, resistance, but skeletal muscle health is really what we're talking about. Where is the disconnect from men versus women or people in general? Part of it is cultural. We live in a society of comfort. It's very easy to take the escalator or take an elevator.

[00:13:04] When it comes to nutrition, we all have to eat, but we don't all have to move. I literally could sit at my house, order my groceries, Amazon Prime, everything. And I never had to take more than 300 steps. For women, typically strength and strength training has not been the focus. And we know that. I mean, even just from a standpoint of walking to the gym, you don't see or you're starting to see it more. I I really do feel like we are on the precipice of women recognizing the importance of strength and muscle, especially with new conversations around menopause and more potent conversations, but they're busy.

[00:13:43] And the other aspect of that is there are self-imposed limitations. A woman would look at a 40 pound weight and go, I can't lift that. But she would look at her 40 pound toddler and go, I'm going to lift that and then I'm going to carry my groceries and uh I got it. And that's really where I think that we can change the disconnect is re-educating the importance of muscle and then also changing the cultural conversation. >> Obviously, you're really fit. Has has resistance training always been something you have enjoyed? Did you grow up doing it or was something you kind of came to uh in your 20s or beyond? >> I grew up doing it. By the time I was five, I was riding 10 miles on a bike.

[00:14:24] And with the conversation around children, if we teach them good habits now, then we don't have to have them spend a lifetime outgrowing old habits because we're not raising children, we're raising adults. And yes, I have always trained. >> So, I'm in the same boat. and the and I and I suspect that's true for all of us.

[00:14:47] And so one of the challenges that I know I have that's a bit of a blind spot is when I'm talking to patients who are perhaps representative of the real world which is people who are like actually I don't enjoy the feeling like you know I'm sure you've all heard this. I don't like the feeling of lifting weights. It hurts. I don't like that. I mean, I I can't tell you how many times I've heard that, and I appreciate the honesty, but

[00:15:11] I can't relate. And it's hard when you can't actually relate to what your patient is saying. I can relate when they complain about having to watch what they eat, cuz that's a struggle I would have. Um, but I truly can't relate to that. So, do you think that that's a function of having started early or do you think that there are literally just just as we have people with different eye colors and different heights, there are truly differences in genetic hard wiring that would speak to an individual's appetite for that kind of discomfort? I I I think it's I actually think it's the latter. I think people there are some people who are more inclined to enjoy that type of stress. I doesn't matter how much I run. I do not enjoy the stress of running. I don't enjoy how I feel. I don't enjoy the the feeling I get in my lungs when I'm sucking for air. Um, I'll do it because

[00:16:02] I know I have to, but I don't there's no enjoyability about that. Training hard and lifting weights and and pushing myself to the to the to the utmost uh level of effort. That's always been something I actually kind of enjoy. And I think that it can be learned though. You can get better at it. just like I can learn the the the the discipline to continue to push and run when I don't want to. So a after doing it for a while when you start to see results the results actually might become motivating enough to go like well there is a trade-off here. I'm seeing the I'm seeing the trade-off. And I think that's what when we were talking about before about people the the the start being the thing that's stopping people is that the perceived level of what they're going to have to do is usually bigger than what they have to do. I' I've mentioned before, you can build a great body on six exercises. Literally, the row, squat, deadlift, bench, pull-up, curl, done. Like, you've got everything you need. You don't have to complicate it if you keep trying to get stronger at those exercises. Now, you might get bored to tears, but you can build the the prerequisite foundation to get a better body, but people want sometimes to complicate it in their heads so that they have an easier out because it makes it a little easier. Say, "Yeah, I don't have time for all that." You know, I we we we liken it to um I've known a few people in my life who've wanted to start businesses, right? And like I got this great idea and I'm they're gung-ho. They want to do it and then they get caught up in I don't know if I should, you know, set up an LLC or if I should do it as a corporation or I want to get my business cards. I can't figure out my logo. And they right, they're doing all that stuff and they never take the step of actually just starting what their what their service is going to be and they never get going. And I think people do the same thing in terms of fitness.

[00:17:45] Like they they make it bigger and they make the commitment larger so that they can almost have a safe landing spot to be like, "Yeah, I just going to get it going." Um, so it's our job to educate them as to how simple it can actually be. Simple being like the what you need to do, but I think the the commitment to actually showing up and doing it, that's that's hard. Mike, what percentage of the people that walk into your gym are coming to resistance training for the first time? >> I'd say 50 if I was guessing because some of them were high school athletes and have some basic relationship with strength training. I What percentage of them are approaching intelligent strength training for the first time? 100%. So most of them are coming, you know, let's we're going to party like it's 1999. Like people come in and they kind of look at us like, what are you doing? And I think that's where when you were talking about people saying the discomfort, my first thing would be like, what discomfort? There shouldn't be any discomfort. If you come in and start working out with us, my whole goal

[00:18:42] I say to somebody, you should get out of bed the next day and be like, I I think I worked out. >> Yeah, >> I felt okay. I always tell everybody, everything's gauged on how you if you get up in the morning and you're crippled. >> Yeah, we did something wrong. >> I suck. I'm like, I did I did a really bad job. You should not be uncomfortable at all. We should be able to This is whatever, you know, slow and steady wins the race. 1% better, however you want to look at it. And if we can just layer like I always think I'm a big attendance guy. If I can get you to show up two days a week for a year, you'll be remarkably different. And you might not have ever had, you know, any people, you know, balls to the wall or go to failure. Like we would have done none of that. Zero. And yet you would look at somebody and think, "Wow, like if you came into our place, everybody looks younger than they do. Every single person. one of I I am 100% certain not just of the longevity benefit but about the physical change that people undergo because I'll just show you people and say yeah that guy's a you know an 80-year-old two-time cancer survivor and people will be like he is and I'm like yep they look different and they all look different they all look younger and again what is that is it hormonal I don't I mean I again I'm not a scientist but I know I know that it works and I know that it doesn't have to be hard and it doesn't have to be uncomfortable. >> So, let's let's talk about an an example of somebody that walks in. So, somebody walks in, they're 50 years old. Uh let's pick a male to start with, but we're going to do many case studies today, I think, cuz that's how people, I think, can sort of connect. My goal is to make sure everybody listening to this can identify with a person, a person we're going to talk about. So, 50-year-old guy comes in. Um he's he's done a little bit of the trade his health for wealth thing. So, he's uh um he's been working himself to to death. Um, and he's he's had some health scare, right? He went to the doctor's office and they told him, "Your your blood pressure is really high or there's something going on." Um, or he's just sort of confronted his own mortality. He's lost a parent, right?

[00:20:35] That's a big wakeup call for somebody in their 50s. Um, played sports in high school, but um, that was about it. Um, so doesn't doesn't really do much of anything now and somehow has landed himself in your gym. Maybe he he saw he saw Jeff on Instagram and he was like, "That guy looks incredible. I gotta I gotta do something." And and you know what what he's doing sounds cool. So So how do you interview this guy? How do you find out what his goals are and and then how do you create that that show up attendance pattern that's going to make sure he's he can give you a year of whatever it is two days a week? >> The show up attendance pattern is a big thing and that's there's a really good book called Never Lose a Customer Again.

[00:21:20] One of the thing we talk about, we appro approach our business much more like a restaurant. Um un uh oh my god, what's the name of it? Unreasonable hospitality I think is the willar book. And you know we we try to get our we try to train our coaches we refer to them coaches more than trainers way more in the customer service skill because we realize that we want to get the person to come back. That's the goal. Get them to come back. Get them to get through the first workout and come back. And I we don't interview people a lot. I don't talk to people about their goals cuz I know what I look at and think your goal is to not be the kind of sad sack of that you are right now unfortunately and that's you know we just want to get you going. So it's like just get them on the conveyor belt and and carry them through and make them this is the one thing and I one of the things I wrote in my notes that CrossFit did well. They created community. You need to create community where people are comfortable. One of the object problems that we had was people would say I can't go there. It's all athletes cuz they come in and you know just from a marketing standpoint, there's jerseys all over the place and it looks like a place where athletes train, but 65% of our business are people like us. But just getting them to be comfortable in that environment and getting them to show up again. When we tell everybody if you've got new people in your group, you should text them that day and you should text them the next day. How was it? How did you feel this morning? We we're trying to build a relationship because it's it's relationship marketing, right?

[00:22:40] Get the person know, like, trust, all the things that you read about. get them to know you, like you, trust you, want to come back, want to be part of it, and then we can take care of the training part, but the the training part to me is is relatively easy. It's the getting that person to be consistent and to come and all I call them check the box clients. I just want check the box clients. If you check the box, which means I got to Mike Boils twice this week, you will get better. You will feel better. >> Say a little bit about the programming.

[00:23:09] I want to I want to understand a little bit about >> the programming for us. very assembly lineish, very I always talk about the idea that uh it's a it's a recipe and not a menu. So, no one gets to pick what they want to do. You come in and it's like, "No, this is this is how the cake is made. It's in this order. This is what you get. Don't like it? Go someplace else where they're letting, you know, go to Planet Fitness. You can make your own cake. You want to come here, you do it the way we do it.

[00:23:32] Everybody foam rolls. Everybody stretches. Everybody does their mobility work. Everybody does dynamic warm-up. Everybody throws medicine balls. Everybody does some sort of power training. I want I plyometrics, not really actually some sort of jump training. Then they'll go and they'll lift. The lift takes 36 minutes. And then they'll go and they'll do some type of conditioning work. And we'll start really really again really easy. Try to give them something that's very achievable. Uh don't get them particularly tired. And then boom, out the door. They're in and out in an hour. >> Hour. Hour door to door. Not doing the shower. >> Yep. >> Okay.

[00:24:08] And 36 minutes of that is the actual resistance training, but obviously everything that's leading up to it and on the back of it is is I mean that's clearly training as well, right? Moving movement more I think honestly for the older client more important. We always talk about the first 15 minutes is more important getting people to to roll to stretch to start to deal with their tissue limitations because most everybody that comes in has something.

[00:24:29] No one comes in healthy. No one comes in. So I have nothing that hurts. And progress is made by advancing weight, advancing reps, advancing sets, uh, jumping higher. I mean, presumably >> pres mostly by advancing weight. I mean, if you're going to look at it the simplest way, it's just try to get them because again, females, right? You're just trying to get them to engage in progressive resistance. I always think what someone said, you know, I've been doing the 5B dumbbells for the last year, I'm like, oh, you only wasted like 50 weeks, right? You know, so our thing is just get them to pick up something that's a little heavier. get them. You know, we try to figure out ways to, you know, it could be isometrics, could be eccentrics, it could be, you know, we try to vary it because now we're in the with our adult clients, we're in the entertainment business a little bit in terms of we've got to keep it interesting. Like you said, you can do six exercises, but we have to figure out, are there 14 different versions of those six exercises that we can do to keep somebody not thinking they're doing the same thing over and over again? And so that's if we get one complaint it might be that it's we're doing we do the same exercises a lot and it's kind of like yeah because we do the good ones but we don't our adults don't touch a barbell. >> Okay. I was going to ask you are there any things that are off limits? >> They don't barbell bench press. They don't barbell deadlift. They don't barbell squat. No one squats anyway.

[00:25:44] That's we that's another whole conversation. But all almost all of our lower body stuff is unilateral. will do goblet squats, basic stuff with people that are really deconditioned because we need them to be capable with two legs before they're going to be capable capable on one leg. But it's very I would like I always say to people, we're really smart and really safe. And I think that's what you want to be if you want to keep people coming back. I think you can be really smart and not be really safe and you can be really safe and not be really good. And I think the the midground is where we want to operate. So, Gabrielle, what's the biggest thing you're thinking about when a patient is in your practice and they're, you know, they're coming along well on many of the other lifestyle adjustments. Let's just assume this is a person who's a lifelong cardio rat, right? So, they love to run. They run two marathons a year. Um, they've been running forever. They've got some nagging injuries, though, right? As you know, a runner, especially a female runner, the probability that her proximal hamstring isn't just torn up is pretty low, especially if she's had kids, right? So, now her pelvis is tilted a little bit. Um, how do you make the case to her cuz she's lean, right?

[00:26:57] Doesn't need to lose weight as though that's the thing that matters, but uh what how are you making the case to her um that that this muscle centric approach matters? Well, she's going to want to be active her whole life. And the healthy her her skeletal muscle mass is, you know, there seems to be somewhat of a disconnect. People talk about strength and then disassociate it from mass, but I believe, you know, and I have patients like this in the practice that are very lean, have always been runners, but we'll see their glucose creep up. We will see an increase in visceral fat. that can be course corrected by addressing skeletal muscle mass. And um you know when you just think about if this woman and I I'm thinking about one patient in particular, she's actually in her she's around 60. She runs a 100 miles. >> She's an ultra. >> Oh, she run she does actual ultra. Her body composition was not nearly as good as it is now. Just by adding in two days a week of resistance training. We added in two days a week. We pulled back on some of the mileage. She's able to move more weight. I mean, and this girl, she is unbel. Hey Sharon, she listens to your podcast. As a matter of fact, she is incredible. by pulling back her training and increasing her weights and being very specific about obviously I don't program but we work with coaches that program by changing up the movement patterns she was able to really increase her lower body strength but also improve her labs improve her fasting insulin her glucose and that and her triglycerides >> and and so you know do you think that that's purely a function of having a larger reservoir to put the glucose into or do you think that it also speaks to the insulin sensitivity? I mean, is it is it does it even make sense to try to disentangle those two? >> It's a great question. I think that the larger reservoir is important for a number of reasons. The metabolic component of muscle the, you know, as we all know, muscle is the primary site for glucose metabolism, also free fatty acids at rest. However, it enables her to have more dietary flexibility because when we think about nutritional sciences and we think about triglycerides, insulin, glucose, what we're really looking at is the health of skeletal muscle. Metabolic syndrome, the markers of metabolic syndrome are the markers of healthy skeletal muscle. Does it her activity improve insulin sensitivity?

[00:29:35] Yes. But her running is she's going to be very insulin sensitive as is. But it's really that metabolic component of having healthy skeletal muscle mass it from what I believe. >> So Jeff, you're working with people a lot of times at the opposite end of the spectrum, right? You're looking people are coming to you often because they want to um they want to have 7% body fat. I mean they and and it might be that they're you know they're an actor and like that they're they're about to do a role where they kind of have to look a certain way. Um, alternatively, it might be an athlete who um probably doesn't need to be at 7% body fat, but might want to be at 7% 7 body fat. So, so, so you're kind of dealing with the other end of the spectrum. Is it safe to say that these people that are coming to you are so long on motivation that that's not really an issue anymore? >> Yeah. When you're when your goals start to become 7% body fat, I'm assuming that you're probably not 35 or 40, you know, with with aspirations to be there. that these guys are usually coming in 12, 13, 14, 15% body fat with want desires to want to get leaner for whatever those reasons, like you said, whether it be a role or I I always tell like the athletes, they have to be very conscientious of not falling in love with what they see in the mirror because ultimately they're not getting paid to look that way unless they're I mentioned sometimes we work with WWE athletes who do get paid to look a certain way and perform at a certain level, but you know, the people that have to be conscientious of the level that they are, you know, what level of body fat they are. So, they have a certain role.

[00:31:12] I mean, they are usually pretty good at being able to dial in. They've often times done this multiple times before, too. So, they've done this and had a history of being able to get down there. They just don't have ability to sustain it. Um, I think that it's always going to be achieved through nutrition. That level of look is a nutritional uh consistency. It is not has nothing to do with training. It has nothing to do with with exercise you're doing. It doesn't matter what split you're following. It doesn't matter any of the any of that.

[00:31:39] All you have to do is be able to remain very consistent with nutrition. And the level that you're able to get down to is just a reflection of how many sacrifices you're willing to make. You know, you want to still drink a couple times a week, that's fine. Just you're going to have to bump it up a notch or two because you really need to be able to make some cuts. Now, I do not believe I don't do it myself. I do not make sacrifices to the point where I'm eating boiled chicken and broccoli, steamed broccoli. I don't do that. I eat meals that are good meals. I You saw what I eat. I can eat a meal that anybody else can eat, but I'm very disciplined in in not straying from those meals. And so, your ability to kind of stay that way is going to determine how low you're able to get and how low you're able to stay.

[00:32:23] I always say if you're eating, let's say, five times a day and that's a seven day a week, it's 35 meals. If you can stay 90% or above, you don't have you don't have to be perfect. If you can stay 90% or above on those meals, you're looking at three meals in a week that aren't perfect. Now, I'm not saying go hog wild and go down to, you know,

[00:32:41] Buffalo Wild Wings and start eating everything you can. I'm saying that they just aren't perfect meals. Your body almost completely ignores those. It just overlooks it. You keep going and and you're the consistency overrides that and you're able to get, you know, to levels that you weren't able to achieve before. But people can't sustain it because either they make it too difficult or as I said it is actually difficult because getting yourself to the gym for one hour five times a week, two times a week, whatever that might be, even the 36 minutes, that's that's that's one level of commitment. It's what you do in the other 23 hours of the day that determines your your look because that is the nutritional responsibility that a lot of us don't have the ability to to manage. How well do you think that's understood? I mean,

[00:33:28] I'd say that for all of you. This is a question for everyone. Um, you know, when when someone looks at a person and says like, "Look at that man. Look at that woman. Look at how jacked they are." Do you think that the average person person appreciates the role of nutrition in that? Or do you think most of them assume I mean that that person must be spending 12 hours a week lifting weights? >> No. I I I I and sorry to jump in, but it's such a a sore spot for me. People

[00:33:56] People always think exercise first. They in my experience, they always think exercise first. To the point where I have people that will say to me, if they see my my my abs or something, they'll say, "Oh, what exercise did you do for that?" You know, and they pat there usually in a it's big belly that they're patting. It's not an exercise. You know, >> I did less of this exercise. I did the reverse. >> Fewer sets of that, more of these, pushing yourself away from the table. I mean, no, they I don't think they have an appreciation for it at all. Their their instinct tells them it's it's exercise, it's movement. >> Would you guys share that sentiment? >> I I would totally agree. And what's so fascinating is the data supports also the synergistic effect of resistance training activity and a calorie control diet which if people could connect the dots that it is not simply training but to be fair training is the most potent stimulus to muscle but you cannot what do they say you cannot outtrain a bad diet. >> I I mean that that's true. I feel like you could when you were 14. Like when I when I was 14, I did train six hours a day, right? I mean, I was running 13 15 miles every morning before the day start, you know, before my workout. Like it was just And all I did was eat, but I was like a garbage disposal. Like breakfast was a bowl of not a bowl, a box of Froot Loops in a large Tupperware bowl. You could put the whole box in the

[00:35:24] It just didn't matter. But but something changes when you're 20 and you can't do that anymore. >> When you're 13 and and younger, you're very anabolic. Muscle the balance between what drives muscle changes as we age. When you're young, you're very driven by insulin. For example, my daughter who is five, she could have 5 g of protein. She doesn't need to have a meal threshold of 30 to get an anabolic response because when you are younger and you are still growing, you're very anabolic.

[00:35:56] After you are done growing, you want to shift from that the insulin usage to the stimulus which then now exercise becomes much more important. Oh, I want to talk about that, but I want So, I'm going to come right back to that, but I want to I want to hear Mike's point on nutrition and then come back to that because that's actually a a very interesting question. >> But, well, think about it. I think about it in a simpler sense. We go from being extremely active to extremely sedentary.

[00:36:22] Suddenly, you get into your 20s and you get a job and you're commuting and maybe 8 hours, 10 hours, you might be sitting on your ass 10 hours a week or 10 hours a day every day. And then you might go to a bar with your friends after. And I don't think people they don't sense the shift. I think our problem is that the shift is happening and then people don't pick up on it until it's too late.

[00:36:42] Suddenly you look down at yourself and think, "Oh my god, what happened? I gained 40 lbs and I'm in horrible shape and I'm completely sedentary." And then then they think, "Oh, I have to do something about this." But then they tend to revert back to whatever information they might have had. And think about what's your relationship with exercise in high school, right? If you're not an athlete, you have a terrible relationship with exercise in high school because it's something that you're made to do. It's not fun. You probably don't understand strength training. So, you you go to the gym. I saw a great presentation one time at a seminar. I forget who someone did it in New York. And they brought in they said, "I'm going to bring in the most important person in fitness." And they brought in a woman who was a member and had her do a half hour talk. And she talked about not, you know, just having the money to join the gym and learning how to train. She said, "I followed this pretty girl who seemed to know all the machines around." She said, "And I would stay like two machines behind her." So, she didn't realize that I was following her, but I would watch what she did and then she'd move two more machines and then I'd do what she did. And then you just realize like this is how people are learning. Like, we all learned to exercise. Somewhere along the way, somebody created kind of that initial imprint on us. And most people's initial imprint is really bad. what I learned to do when I was in my, you know, teens was just moronic in terms of the way I would look at it now. I would tell everybody and that's why I say the reason I say the things that I say is because I've done everything conceivably wrong that you can do and I have all the orthopedic maladies to show for it. >> What do you guys do? Do you guys have nutritionists in your uh in your business that also help people when they're also trying to lose weight in addition to improve strength and other metrics? We've tried a whole bunch of different ideas and none of them have ever really stuck to be honest. We still have another one going right now. One of the guys that works for us is trying to do nutritional consults. And truthfully, we've never found one that we felt really was sticky that a lot of people would do it. But we deal in the the most basic nutritional information that we can with people in terms of, hey, you know, we want you to hydrate better. We want you to eat more protein. That's why that's why your message is great. Like your book is perfect. It's like, okay, if we can just get people to eat not even more protein, never mind, eat protein. We still have people say, what's protein, adults who don't really even understand the the most, again, we're we're so sometimes up here and then realizing that our consumer is somewhere, even our intelligent consumer is way down here with these incredible, you said disconnect. I had disconnect written down, incredible disconnects, incredible misconceptions. I have women, well, I don't want to start lifting cuz I don't want to get too big. And I'm kind of like, trust me, buddy. That's that is not what we're worried about right now.

[00:39:23] But they're >> still trying. >> They're right. Exactly. You're trying like hell and you're up, you know, whatever 125 pounds or something like that. >> 110 110. >> You're killing you. But I mean, you're killing yourself in the gym to build muscle. It's not It's not easy to do. It's not easy to do for anybody. It's not easy to do for males, >> but we see too much steroid use, >> right? And then we see too much uh responders. Like you look at NFL guys. I mean, I think there's people that are that are way higher responder levels than other people. And I think we look at responders or we look at like when I was a kid coming up, I was looking at people taking drugs, but I didn't know they were taking drugs. I thought I thought I could look like I can remember

[00:39:58] I'd go to bodybuilding shows. I can remember looking at Boyer Co, you know, and thinking, you know, I can look like that and Frank Zayn, I can look like that. And then, you know, suddenly in my 20s realizing that these guys were taking drugs and that was why they look like that. But I spent years frustrated.

[00:40:14] Why don't I Why don't I look that good? I'm doing all the right stuff. So, I think this the and that's why these things are good because trying to get people to see reality, I guess. >> Jeeoff, you talked a minute ago about five meals a day. So, let's double click on that a little bit. Most people think,

[00:40:32] I thought I'm only supposed to have three meals a day or sometimes just one if I'm intermittently fasting. So, talk about the five meals per day. >> Yeah, I mean, I actually I know a lot of people that intermittent fast and actually do well with that. Um the thing that I think why more more people do better with more frequent meals is simply because they tend to get hungry throughout the day and they don't have good management of hunger and then therefore portion control and they don't have willpower to sort of wait to that next meal. So, if they are hungry in the midm morning and they have nothing sort of pre-planned or or prepared for a snack, they'll just go into the kitchen at work and just start picking and grazing. And that's where a lot of the calories throughout the day are consumed, not in those three main meals, but in the grazing that happens because they can't make it to the next meal. So,

[00:41:20] I just found that it's been easier, especially from the athletic world. These guys want to fuel more often, so they want something in between their main meals. But in the world of just um the the regular individual who wants to be more uh disciplined with their nutrition, it's easier to actually program in two additional snacks.

[00:41:40] Nothing big, but just snacks in between that I always think should still focus and center around a protein because again I believe that protein is should be the cornerstone of every every one of our meals and snacks because we don't get enough. Um, that's enough just to keep somebody a probably more metabolically stable to get to the next meal, but also it starts to teach them the willpower to do it. So, if you're sitting there, you ate breakfast is 8:00 and then now it your next meal is at let's say uh 12 or 12:30. When it's 10:00, if you get hungry and you have a snack there, you don't have to get through 4 hours of willpower that you don't have right now to get to that lunchtime. you only have to get through two hours and of those two hours, you weren't hungry the whole time anyway.

[00:42:24] Only the last half hour. So, you're teaching yourself willpower over the course of an hour and a half. And then, you know, I actually have dropped back a little bit to where I'm not necessarily doing five meals in a day. Now, I'll maybe do four, but I have >> Yeah. Walk me through walk me through a day in in the life for you. So, if you're not not on a day when you're here and traveling, so you're at home, you your first meal is what time? >> Um, it depends on it, you know, weekend or not, but usually 7:30, 8:00. And what is that meal? >> And usually it's uh oatmeal, egg whites.

[00:42:53] Um but again, not like my oatmeal I we call it pumpkin oatmeal. Like it's it's oatmeal, it's it's walnuts, it's uh a splendor brown sugar or or brown sugar if you don't care about, you know, the the the cal, you know, the um the calories in it. Um whipped cream, put whipped cream on top. Uh pumpkin I mix inside. Like it it's good. Like it tastes good and it's something that I actually enjoy. If it wasn't, I could never just eat boiled oatmeal for the rest of my life. And then egg whites because you're just trying to cut the calories. >> No. >> Do you want the protein without the total calorie of the egg? >> Yeah. Although I'll mix in I I I would like just at the hotel here, I'll eat eggs. I just the prepared eggs here cuz they're there because I have my egg whites and I keep them in a in a in frozen egg whites I can use. I don't have like I don't want to start cracking full eggs to put into. I'm a little bit simplistic when it comes to my nutrition because I know what works for me. But I have no problem with mixing one or two full eggs. I think you should. people should um and then I'll have uh uh milk with that or I'll have even a protein shake along with that. So, they're not small meals either. Okay. >> Um that will take me through now I'll actually go to lunchtime. In the past, I would have had uh um like a another small snack. I'd have some pretzels and uh jerky or something like just again some protein and then some carbohydrates. Um, then I'll go to lunchtime and at lunch I'll have either um, it's funny because I'll either have a chicken grilled chicken wrap with vegetables and yogurt. That would be my preferred meal. Some fruit. That would be my preferred meal. Or I'll have cereal cuz I am still a cereal addict.

[00:44:27] And we have lots of cereal choices, but I try not to choose the Cinnamon Toast Crunch that my son prefers. And I'll have something else, but I'll have cereal and yogurt. Um, just >> How much protein are you getting in that meal then? um from I'll have I'll have uh usually a protein shake there too. So

[00:44:41] I have my protein shake that's 30 g plus the the yogurt another 8 to 12 g. Um and then in the cereal a little bit more milk too. So I get enough protein from the meal. It's just a little bit u less preferential in terms of where the carbs come from. I don't really get crazy about the carbs. I just try to pick lower sugar carbs. I try not to be um I try to be a little bit more um selective when it comes to that. But >> and then you do an afternoon snack around. >> Then afternoon snack would be the same would be the same type of thing as whatever the first snack was. Um in terms of I I like jerky, so I'll have some jerky. Just pick at it. And again, some some type of um like crunchy food just like a like a pretzel. Be easy for me to have a handful of pretzels. Then I will have um my dinner which actually well actually before that I have another protein shake after I train. So if I train it will >> and you train in the afternoon typically >> randomly I'll train at 5 before I finish up work randomly but most often than that I wind up uh having my shake and then I'll go train at night like late late at night. So my whole thing is >> I think I think we have an input into the sleep issue. >> We do have input into the sleep issue but I'm not having I could fall right asleep after my dinner. The is the issue for me is that >> when I get home my kids have been waiting to see me all day. Um, and I make myself available to them. We play, we run, we go in the pool, whatever it might be. And then they go to bed a little bit late. You know, we have a busy household, so four dogs. It gets a lot to put everybody down, but they go to bed around 9, 9:30. And then when I finally get to the gym, it could be 10:30. So now I'll go and I'll train. I don't like to train on a full stomach. I hate the feeling. So I'll I'll opt to have my dinner afterwards. But that does mean that the dinner could come at 11:30, sometimes even 12:00 at night.

[00:46:31] And that is not recommended for everybody listening. But like that I I also I do think I could dispel the myth though. I do not believe in the don't eat after six at all. I don't believe in that at all. Your body, especially if you're carrying a good amount of muscle, which is why we want to um can utilize those calories, can utilize that protein, can utilize those carbs throughout the day, provide, you know, whenever they do come in. Um and I don't think that just magically eating after six is is the deathnell to having low body fat. So that that's not part of my equation. The only part of the equation for me is I could get like it's a little late in the day to be eating. >> Yeah. It might be impacting your sleep more than anything else. It's clearly not impacting, you know, your fuel partitioning. >> No. And I've been I've been blessed to have the ability to, you know, hit the pillow and fall asleep within minutes and stay asleep because I don't sleep very long. I sleep five to well, six hours, five to six hours. But my quality of sleep is usually very high. I don't wake up I don't wake up at all. I wake up when when the time to wake up in the morning. >> So, I want to kind of go back to what you were talking about a second ago because it opened the door towards protein in kids. Um, but before we do that, maybe just for people listening who have been maybe not paying attention to some of the stuff we've we've all been talking about elsewhere around protein consumption, what type of guidance are you giving your patients on uh on protein? Is there any difference between men and women? And are you differentiating it based on age? >> Age, yes. Men and women, no. When we talk about protein, typically we talk about one thing, but it's 20 different amino acids, nine of which are essential. We actually eat for those nine essentials. There is a lot of nuance around protein in general and uh what it does. Each of those amino acids do something different. For example, leucine, which is I know our favorite amino acid is critical for muscle for muscle protein synthesis. But something like thrienine is important for mucin production in the gut. When you are eating a lower protein diet, the organs well I suppose I should start with why are we eating protein? We need about 250 grams a day. We recycle much of that we don't eat that. A portion of that probably the largest portion maybe 75% of that goes towards visceral tissue for turnover and maintenance. Maybe 25% of that goes to muscle. But we have to continue to get these essential amino acids so that we can maintain rebuilding and repairing which the efficiency of that changes as we age.

[00:49:07] Anabolic resistance, protein efficiency decreases. Those are or that is one reason why we need dietary protein just to maintain the tissue integrity and the structure. Women and men do not need at this time from what we know in the literature a different amount of protein is not sex specific. It's body weight specific. The minimum amount of protein I would ever recommend would be 100 gram at a minimum. Men or women that would be the starting place because if you are say 115 lb woman and you are following the

[00:49:44] RDA at grams per kg, what is that 45 gram of protein or so? That's that's not enough. >> Part of the failure there is that we have to recognize protein is different amino acids. And so when we talk about muscle health, we need to get enough lucine to support muscle health. And that is probably the recommendation is two to three grams a day. It's probably for optimal health around eight or nine. >> And how do you get folks to think about that? Right. which is um cuz now all of a sudden you get into dramatic differences in terms of protein source.

[00:50:21] So if you I don't really think we should go down the PDcast pathway necessarily for everybody today, but but just in terms of understanding that foods are created different, right? So um you can look at an ingredient label of something that says 30 grams of protein. You can look at another thing that says 30 grams of protein, but they don't list out the amino acids. They don't tell you that this one has more leucine or more methionine and this one doesn't. But there are certain themes that we know, right? We know that dairy derived protein, beef derived protein, and egg derived protein seem to have the highest amount of the right amino acids or let's just say the more important amino acids.

[00:51:00] So when you're when you're when you're saying to that person, hey, I want you to eat a minimum of 100 grams per day, does it come with the caveat of assuming you're getting your protein sources here? >> And what you're pointing out is protein quality. The there are plant sources of protein and there are animal sources of protein. And just from hard fast biological numbers, we considered a high quality protein to be eggs and dairy, fish, chicken, any of the animal source proteins. The lower quality proteins would come from plants. When we educate our patients in the practice, we have them choose. And we really don't focus on plant proteins as a source of protein. While they do have amino acids and certainly a combination is wonderful, we like to focus on plant foods for fiber and let's say we take out soy, but we really want to focus on high quality animal source foods because listen, it makes up let's say makes up 30% of our diet. Nearly 100% of our calcium are bioavailable iron and zinc, selenium come from these animal-based foods. And while we talk about protein, we should also talk about nutrient quality. Whether someone decides to get their protein from plants or animals, it isn't just about protein. It is also about those nutrients of concern. For women, like bioavailable iron, for kids, bioavailable iron, nutrients that primarily come from animal sources. I I just think are really important. And again, nothing wrong with plant-based proteins, but we eat plants for fiber and phytonutrients. >> And so presumably you have some patients as as I do who are vegetarians and in some cases it's ethical, religious, whatever the reason is. Um >> what are some of the what are some of the things that you and let's go one step further and let's go because at least vegetarians will at least be able to consume the dairy portion. But when you if you have somebody who's vegan and who is purely looking at animal sources of protein, how much of an uphill battle is that? >> Well, it's the challenge is the carbohydrate consumption. So, I was listening to what Jeff was saying and he was absolutely right. He could have You were saying that you have maybe 100 grams of carbs and you have no problem with it at a meal. Did you say that? >> Well, I mean, you probably calculated it in your head, but yeah, that's that I can do that. And for someone like him who is super active, he is able to dispose of those carbohydrates. But a normal person, our carbohydrate threshold, if you calculate the disposal from skeletal, muscle, organ systems, it is not much. It is about 40 gram in a 2-hour period. Anything above say 40 or 50 grams in a nonex exercising adult will result in a robust insulin response. We do not want that. We do not want to be utilizing insulin to help support glucose. We want to use activity or have the health of our skeletal muscle be able to balance that. And um I suppose what we're talking about is carbohydrates. And unless you are highly active like you are, then we also have to think about the carb portion of this. And designing a diet, typically for us, we think a lot about a 1:1 ratio of protein to carbs at a meal depending. Let me think about that in myself. Um, that's pretty tough.

[00:54:20] You have to be pretty deliberate about withholding carbohydrates to and and I eat I mean, I'm probably eating a gram of protein per pound of body weight. So, it's not like I'm skimping on protein. Um, yeah, maybe I maybe I I don't know. I would I would >> But you're metabolically healthy and that goes back to this hierarchy of how we deter >> I think you have a longer leash if you're active. >> Absolutely. When we make protein decisions in the practice, when we're designing a diet, it's age, it's activity, and it's metabolic health. If you are metabolically healthy, then you can tolerate. There's no problem, right?

[00:54:55] Carbs aren't the enemy. But once we find out someone is metabolically unhealthy, which you can see from blood work, then you have to begin, you know, you don't change your protein amount because as you restrict calories, you keep protein the same or higher because you must protect lean tissue. And also it's it's better. I mean, we've seen this in the data for a long period. >> What about overweight patients? So, if you let's say you had a patient who's let's say it's a man, 250 pounds and um

[00:55:23] I know we're going to talk about body fat because I'm actually super interested in what you what you have to say about that. But let's just assume you did a DEXA on this guy. You don't need to do a DEXA, by the way. You can look at his you can look at him. You know, you know this guy's carrying way too much fat. But the DEXA just gives you some numbers. The guy's 40% body fat. Okay. Um, so when you're trying to tell him how much protein to eat, are you doing it based on an ideal body weight or are you doing it based on his 250 pounds that he's carrying around? >> His target body weight. >> Okay. So, you're going to say, I'm targeting for you 16% body fat. Let's calculate how much lean tissue you have at what would you what would be your ideal body weight at 16% body fat? And that's what we're going to target you at. >> Yeah. >> Okay. Um, I want to totally pivot and talk about something that you already brought up, Mike, and and this speaks to how these round tables get totally messy because I'm not done with nutrition. I want to come back to it, but I don't I I don't want to forget this idea of unilateral lower extremity training. >> So, this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart. So, I grew up um, and apologies for people in the audience who've heard me talk about this, but this is just context for you. I grew up powerlifting was one of the things I did on the side. It actually wasn't a sport.

[00:56:32] I mean, I boxing was my life, but I became hooked on being in the gym. And the gym I belonged to was a dungeon. It was an old man dungeon, two stories underground with no windows. And I didn't realize how lucky I was at the time, but this happened to be like the power training, you the powerlifting epicenter, right? So, you basically just had a bunch of middle-aged men who were machines. Like, you know, these are even even the guys that weighed like, you know, everybody could bench press two times their body weight, squat three to times their body weight, deadlift four times their body weight. So that's what

[00:57:06] I grew up doing. I was like, we bench, we squat, we deadlift, and we do it really, really heavy. And not surprisingly, over time, like I started to get injured, right? I injured my back by the time I was in medical school. and um kind of decided like I I don't know if this is worth the risk anymore. Like

[00:57:25] I don't I don't really see that I need to have four plates on my back squatting anymore and almost through necessity had to discover single leg training. So, I want you to say more about that experience and help somebody because I have patients who really can't believe that you can achieve optimal lower body hypertrophy without a barbell on your back or without picking a barbell up off the floor. >> Yeah. Which is amazing. I same background as you. I got into competitive powerlifting in college just because I was no longer an athlete and I was looking for an outlet and it was like, okay, I'm good at lifting weights.

[00:58:02] So started competing in powerlifting, started hurting myself, back problem, shoulder surgery and athletic training background, get to college as a strength coach, start to see the same things. I've got athletes with back problems. Everybody's back problem seems to come down to one thing, back squatting. Every kid, cuz we weren't we there weren't deadlift, we were the old school like squat, bench, power clean because that was the football mentality at that time.

[00:58:29] But the people with back pain had it always related right back to back squat. We started to look at that and think, okay, if we're doing something that we know is hurting 20% of our population, should we continue to do that? For a while, we had to because the football coaches mandated it. But when I got to the point where I was kind of fully in control, I said, "We're not going to do this anymore." And then we went the unilateral route. >> Sorry. When you say football coaches, are you saying even at the level of the

[00:58:54] NFL? uh at at every level the football coaches, you know, they want to know how many guys can bench press 400 lb and how many guys can squat 500 lb and how many guys can, you know, they're it's it's still a very old school mentality. It's getting better. NFL level is getting much better because >> is the bench still uh in the combine for anyone but a quarterback. Y >> everybody's still benching and still benching 225 as a strength test. They do an endurance test for strength. We could talk about the >> the foolishness of the combine, too, but that's another >> The same combine that you helped develop. >> The same combine that I helped train people for. Yes. It is not. I always tell people it's like getting in copy of the SAT and all you got to do is cheat.

[00:59:28] You just got to practice the event, practice the questions, you know the test. You know the answers, practice, you'll get good at it. We we developed that thought process. But so we started going just down this sort of unilateral rabbit hole and then we but then you start getting into the biggest thing that people have to understand is when you get into the bilateral deficit research, you're stronger on one leg.

[00:59:49] You have more strength capability on one leg than you do on two because your body there's and there's research. >> It's so interesting. Sorry to interrupt you, Mike. It's so interesting how difficult it is to appreciate that when you're not doing unilateral exercises >> and people don't try it and then it's very dogma oriented because we we've all grown up around kind of the squat poems and all these things about, you know, king of all lifts and all this that people spout and I'm always kind of spouting the anti of that. But the reality is we started seeing when we first started testing is what happened was one of my assistants this guy Jeff

[01:00:22] Oliver who's been at Holy Cross for 25 years said to me if we could test you onelegged strength would you stop squatting and I was like yes. So then we said okay let's try to figure out how we test. So we started making up these sort of halfass one leg squat test you know doing rep maxes in different split squat variations and things. But when we did it the results blew us away in terms of >> the difference between sides blew you away. Uh, no. The the the ability to be stronger than we were or as strong as we were bilaterally blew us away. So, we had guys >> the first year I did it with my hockey team 200 maybe six or seven somewhere in there. >> And everybody could split squat what they could front squat. Same amount. So, if I did a backsplit squat test, everybody that could back split squat 300 lb was a 300lb front squatter. everybody that could back split squat, you know, project project out to a 400 lb max was a 400 front squat. Right across the board, it was exactly dead even, one leg to two legs. And then people would say, "That's cuz they're using their back leg." They were trying to come up with all these rationes for why it wasn't. But the numbers were just glaring, you know. Then we went to a split squat test and we had one kid who did uh did 240 lbs for 20 reps, which, you know, if you bilateral it out, it's 480 for 20. He's a 200lb hockey player, 190 lb hockey player. They just the numbers started to smack us in the face a little bit and I started look and then you start looking at the bilateral like you look at the grip strength research bilateral deficit right hand plus left hand will be more than combined two hand you look at you know they've done it with leg extension they've done it with a bunch of different things and what they realize I think this is my own theory but we neurologically know that we are unilateral if I said to you try to dunk a basketball I'm going to guarantee your right >> foot I'm going to jump off one foot >> you're going to jump off your left foot you're going to hold ball in your right hand everybody Everybody here is going to do it except 10% of us are lefty. So 10% of us are going to grab it in our left hand. But everybody knows if I say to you throw a baseball, I always say to somebody, if I say throw a baseball, everybody knows how to throw it. If I say throw two baseballs, somebody would think, I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to do this right now. We understand neurology and then we deny it when we start strength training because we want to deny it. And I think it's actually limiting. I think I've said to people I think I think I spent a lot of time probably making people less athletic at the higher levels. One of the things that we noticed >> you you you think that that you did that in the past? >> In the past. Yes. Because we had some of our really some of our super elite like

[01:02:48] NFL wide receiver type guys would be very resistant to really heavy back squats and deadlifts and things like that. And they would always they were like cats. They like I don't I don't like it. I don't like it. It makes my back sore. I don't feel right. And what you realize is you were probably dampening their nervous system a little bit because the analogy I always use, if you think of like the mountain, the guy from uh Game of Thrones, he was an

[01:03:08] Icelandic basketball player, decent mid-level Icelandic basketball player. When he became one of the world's strongest men, he was a worse basketball player. And I can remember I went to used to go to powerlifting meets and I'd look at the powerlifting meets and I would be like, "Nobody here looks athletic. No one." And then I'd go to an

[01:03:26] Olympic lifting meet and I'd be like, "These cats are athletic. Like these guys can they can jump and they can sprint and they've got big traps and big asses. They look sort they looked more like what I wanted my athletes to look like." Whereas powerlifting, it was sort of like a semi-mobile refrigerator imitation, you know, just people lumbering and even little people lumbering around. The little people lumbered just as bad as the big people.

[01:03:46] And then you go to a track meet and go watch the sprints and the jumps and you're like, "Oh, wait. That's what I want. That's what I'm trying to get everybody to. So I became a big Charlie Francis guy in the 90s. You know, you start looking at this and saying, "Okay, let's look at how the fastest people in the world, the people that jump the highest in world, what are they doing for training?" And again, you started to see more unilateral work, unilateral plow work, unilateral strength work. So it was sort of this this rabbit hole that I just I went down and never came back from. >> You know, it's interesting. Uh Charlie

[01:04:23] Francis of course a lot of people will will sort of just have a sort of negative thought associated with him because the association with Ben Johnson but I but I don't think a lot of people realize his coaching genius. Um can you say a little bit more about Charlie who sadly passed away I think due to cancer kind of young right? Yeah, kind of young. I luckily one of the guys I said someone said that you know anybody you've never met in the field that you would have liked to have met and I said yeah I wish I had met him at that time but when you think about he developed worldass sprinters in Canada almost all of them from Toronto greater Toronto area the probability of doing that is really really low and so you think and he was so far ahead of his time if you read Charlie Francis training system right now it was originally published as Charlie Francis training system then after he got in trouble they republished it as training for speed. So, it's the same book. You can just get it on the internet. But he's talking about recovery, regeneration, massage. Now, this book was written in the '8s. You would read it right now and think, my god, this thing was written a month ago by a guy.

[01:05:21] I mean, he was using words that I hadn't even seen yet. It was the first time I encountered even the word. So, I started to think that's we started to do massage work with our athletes. We that's where we started foam rolling because we realized we can't get massage done for every single athlete, but we can get everybody to foam roll. and he was always talking about tissue quality and tissue resets and the therapists that you know they'd bring excuse me they would bring therapists to training camps that they were doing and it was so forwardinking I mean imagine cuz now well 45 years ago right I guessif you know 35 years ago whatever it was it was a long time ago and he was so far ahead of the field frighteningly and to the point where it's still really I still encourage people to read his stuff now I started reading I read everything he wrote. I even they had I read Speed

[01:06:10] Trap, which was more about what had happened to them in the process. And then I read this Angela Seno, who was one of his sprinters, wrote a book. I read that book. I I just read every thing I could consume about Charlie Francis to see, you know, is there another little nugget of something that I'm missing. And I guess from the track and field thing, I never looked back. I never looked and said, you know, I don't care what power lifters are doing. I don't really I care what Olympic lifters are doing. really athletically. And then we started to look at rehab and we realized that from a rehab standpoint, it was all unilateral and it was all what they were calling functional and it was all what they were calling clos chain. And suddenly it just to me it all it all made sense. It all kind of uh it all came together for me at that point in time. So and we've been doing that for I don't know like I said 30 years.

[01:06:58] So Jeff, in your world training people the way you are, what are the exceptions to those rules for you? When are the times when you're saying or are you saying no, I still see that the riskreward tradeoff for someone in a certain position is there for you know a back a barbell back squat or you know a sumo deadlift or something like that.

[01:07:20] How do you how do you think about that? I think that if there's there's always the argument of can you train? See, a lot of times in especially in Mike's world too, when when people come to him, they've already learned bad mechanics for squats. So, they're bad squatters when they come to him. So, they're already demonstrating habits that are going to totally break down their body by continuing to just pile more and more weight on. I think when you can intervene with somebody at an early age and teach them biomechanically how to squat better, which Mike and I have discussed before at length, like it's not it's not easy to to really dissect that lift. It's a complicated lift.

[01:07:59] There's a lot of moving parts. So, you have to be willing to spend a lot of time with that person to teach them from the ground up. In those instances when you can, I think you could probably teach somebody how to squat more safely. That doesn't take away the fact that if you can do it and not have to load that way and especially as we talk about the aging population, then the benefits might still outweigh outweigh the risks in terms of it's just better to single leg squat. But I think that you can probably teach that lift, but you have to be willing to teach that person to either unlearn the bad things that they've already learned or if they're starting out early, learn how to do it more properly. And you could do it in stages, too. You can by squatting to a box, you can biomechanically fix a lot of people's issues because having the target or the safety net behind them is enough to sort of get them to actually move in a better better way. But you don't want to train that way, you know, without ultimately going to a freestanding squat if they're going to be ultimately, you know, playing playing sports and and needing to do something like, let's say, an offensive lineman coming off the off the uh the line. But

[01:09:01] I again I'm actually in Mike's camp in terms of the value of of of single leg training. We do so much single leg training with Athlete X because I believe that it's not just the unloading that we get from the single leg squat. It's just a it's just as Mike said how we're wired, how we're actually preferred to move. And I I get I took some along the way because anytime you pick up a leg from the ground, it's functional training. And then all of a sudden that has was a cool thing at one time. It's not a cool thing anymore. But you do pick up your leg and yes that's functional for a reason. So I think doing uh lunging and step-ups we did we built a whole program in our um and with the Mets around step-ups and lunging because we knew how important that was.

[01:09:44] And again we did other forms of bilateral lifting. We would do trap bar deadlifting um to to clean up some of the issues that people had. I always say that if you want to learn how to squat, take a dumbbell, u hold it between your your hands or a kettle bell and just let the ball let the dumbbell the weight go straight down to the ground. It will put you biomechanically in almost a perfect position because you're just letting the the the weight drop straight down your center of mass. That's a great tool for teaching what people what it's supposed to feel like. But when you then go put the bar on their back, as soon as the bar they don't have thoracic mobility, all the things that they're lacking start to change that that dramatically from just you think it's the same exercise cuz you're going straight up and down, but it's a very different exercise because now when your hands are up and again thoracic the extension is more required. They don't have that and the whole system gets thrown out of whack. So it it's um it's done. it's still done in certain circumstances and you're always going to still encounter people who I don't know Mike you might just tell them to go to a different gym but like you know there's going to be people who will insist that they still have to squat and they want to learn how to do it and do it more safely and I think having the you know the the the willingness or the ability to still coach them through that is important but because of guys like Mike and because hopefully stuff that I talk about like the people are less reliant on those as the as the only things that they can do. >> Yeah. I I've you know, I'm a little conflicted. Less less so now, but I think up until up until about 18 months ago, I was still squatting and deadlifting regularly, though with much less weight, right? I wasn't I was never going below five reps. Um, and frankly targeting 8 to 12 most of the time. And my rationale for it was the following. I viewed it as an amazing audit of my chain. So, I filmed every set. So, I have a tripod in the gym. My phone would sit on it. I would from the warm-up set to the last set, every set was filmed and my recovery was watching the video.

[01:11:40] And the truth of the matter is, despite that, about one in every eight workouts, I just screwed something up. And I would spend the next four days in pain. And I'd be sitting in the shower running hot water on my back. Was it anything catastrophic? No, not at all. I got my erectors just flared up. It wasn't the end of the world.

[01:12:03] What it said to me was I I mean people watching us might be offended by the statement, but I'm getting old. I'm getting old. >> You look great for 25. Come on. >> And as I think all of us would agree, the name of the game when you're old is never getting out of the game. Like there's nothing more devastating. It's one thing to get injured when you're 20.

[01:12:27] You're going to be back. But if a 55year-old, never mind a 70-year-old, if a 55-year-old has to take a year off because of some devastating injury, it's really difficult to come back. And so I very sadly decided that the risk that I was going to do something dumb and actually I'll tell you the straw that broke the camel's back. I used to do a lot of tire flipping. So, I used to have this 450lb tire and my favorite my absolute favorite activity was how many there was different games you would play. So, you would love the gamification of it, right? It's like how many times could you flip it? How long did it take you to flip it 25 times or something like that?

[01:13:06] And so, when I moved to Austin, I didn't have my tire cuz it was out in San Diego. So, of course, I had my assistant call and find a guy who could find the closest tire to 450 lbs. We found one that was 407bs. The guy delivered. He's like, "What the hell do you want this thing for?" I start flipping it again and my friend who's a really awesome PT was watching me and he goes, "Have you ever hurt yourself doing that?" And I said, "Never." He goes, "You are you are in a remarkable amount of uh of lumbar flexion right now." Um, and I would just be careful like at you know, you you know that the the lumbar spine does not like to be in this position when it is that loaded. And I was like, you know, he's right. like I can absolutely see how under fatigue I could just, you know, do something too much. So anyway, it's sorry for the ramble, but the point was I basically decided as much as I love this exercise, as much as it's a great audit, I you know, this I'm learning I'm I'm I love the idea of critiquing my form between sets, I just sort of decided the riskreward trade-off wasn't there for me. Um, do you think that's sort of a do you think that's a mistake? Do you think that I should have stuck with it and and made other modifications? >> No, I don't. I I think because you have these options, I don't think there's a compromise in the benefits you're getting from single A training. Like I said, there's probably more benefits that you're getting from that. Um I I will I'm right in that same boat with you. I spent probably from 35 to 45 wanting so badly to get a I have bad knees and I and that probably comes from my flat feet, but I I wanting so badly to not have to squat because every time

[01:14:49] I did it would it was just it would kill my my knees the next day would be horrifyingly pain in pain and my low back would ultimately wind up taking on that same brunt. I know exactly the same spot you're talking about, but yet I kept telling myself, "But you have to squat. You have to squat." Like, it's just what we do. We have to squat. Like, so I would try to get past the point of the things that were bothering me, and I would ultimately go back under the bar and squat again until I, you know, through watching Mike and others said like, "No, you know, it really doesn't it's not a requirement to get what I'm trying to get out of it. I'm trying to hypertrophy my legs. I'm trying to get stronger hips. I'm trying trying to get uh stay injury-free." And so my favorite exercise at that point became uh a reverse lunge. So I'll do it with a barbell or I'll do it with dumbbells.

[01:15:36] And honestly, it's a little easier with the barbell because I don't have to worry about the grip of holding the dumbbells. >> And so reverse lunge meaning you're starting in a standing position and you're doing a step back. >> Step back or step back. >> And you I've seen a great video on this where you emphasize how wide you're stepping out. >> Yeah. You need because you don't want

[01:15:53] That's the thing. And this is where some of the functional training stuff comes up. Like, oh, it's a balance exercise. That's a bad sign of strength exercise. It's a balance exercise. It's not a balance exercise. If you can't keep your feet wide enough, you all you have to do is just step back and out. You'll maintain a wide enough base where you still have support. And then it's a strength exercise if you're lifting a lot of weight. >> I remember where I was when I watched that video of you and I went to the gym that day and I was like, I've never thought about taking a wider stance. I mean, I added 40 lbs. >> Right. And I think it's also my second big tip on that exercise is as you go down just I I tell I call it like screwing yourself into place, but you know, you're really not. You just take a little bit of a rotation towards the front leg. So you're just taking your tors. So you take it a little bit over the front leg. It will it will basically stabilize that front leg a little bit more. And again with with enough contact

[01:16:41] I think what what do we when we do those um reverse split like situations? It's about 75% on the front leg or so. >> Yeah. How about Yeah. So, I mean, you still got 25% going back on that back leg, and that's enough to support you and and make sure that you're not falling all over the place, but that that is my my favorite way. And I recommend people all the time to do that. Lunging forward is fine, but people that have knee issues like myself, um that doesn't feel too good either. So, it's like why not do it this way? Because this is a safer way that has less orthopedic issues for people and it's still a great you can go you can pretty heavy if you're going to use a barbell there, too. So, u that's my favorite substitute. And since I learned that there were other things I can do and not compromise whatever it was that

[01:17:23] I was chasing at the time, um I have since sort of backed away from that and and you can ask Jesse. Every now and then I'll I'll go back and try again and inevitably in a few days I start things start, you know, clicking on my hip or things that didn't pop or click before and I I do believe that there's a path away from that. So, so for you before I want to talk about your patients, but personally because we're all telling personal stories, what have you changed in your training, resistance training specifically, as you've aged, as you've increased wisdom, whatever, whatever, whatever the case might be. >> I wish I could say I get less hurt. Um, before we started the podcast, I said that I had a right torn hamstring and a proximal or distal, it is proximal, and quad fem, which is very unusual. glute me and gluten that I love to overachieve.

[01:18:14] I thought it was a great idea about eight years ago to keep up with my husband who my husband was a former SEAL who's now at Baylor. I thought we would do a 50-hour event and I was not physically capable or prepared to do that. It's just another Tuesday for him. And I tore my left hamstring on a sprint.

[01:18:38] Since that time, I think that it changed my ability to squat. I kept going back to the squat. I am not able to do that at all now. But that changed probably I don't know 6 months ago. I stopped squatting six months ago. I also found out that I had hip dysplasia. all of these injuries, all of these patterns which you know as

[01:18:58] I think is as someone who is listening or watching this if something doesn't feel right you talk about taking that wide step back if someone is doing something that people will say okay this is a squat pattern but it doesn't feel right to you I had been squatting in a much too narrow position for someone that has hip dysplasia and so I ground out my hip and but I'm somewhat stubborn for those people that that know me I just kept doing it because I believe that we should squat. Needless to say,

[01:19:27] I'm now in a position where I am doing only single leg movements and really trying to pull back, probably be doing some PRP for this now new injury. And I say that all about um someone in a roundabout way that as we age, like you said, Peter, the worst thing that you can do is stop. You know, and I think about Doug Patton Jones's work, the catabolic crisis model. This isn't a catabolic crisis, but a catabolic crisis model is when you're off the table, you lose muscle mass and strength rapidly over 40 you and that continues per decade. So my training has changed dramatically. I do more high intensity um on say the bike or the air down a air dime versus any kind of long slow steady state which I would love to get back into. And then also the lifts are all >> So you're able to do highintensity stuff on a bike with a high hamstring tear. >> Well, this is new. This >> this new tear just happened. I got my

[01:20:25] MRI back two days ago. >> Got it. >> So I I won't be able to. >> So when you're recovered, so let's just say we're we're sitting here in 9 months, which >> I'll be recovered before then. >> All right. Very well. Um when you're recovered, how is it going to change what you do going forward? And how will that impact what you modify in terms of your patients? Because I think all of us are practitioners here and therefore we're kind of we're students. We we do a lot of self-experimenting. We make a lot of mistakes on ourselves that gets us curious about, you know, okay, what's the lesson here? How do I make sure that my client, my patient doesn't make the same mistakes? So, what's what are you going to change and how is it going to impact what you tell patients? Now, >> definitely it doesn't have to be these big lifts. We don't all have to squat.

[01:21:11] And for me personally having to deal with that I prior to injuring my hamstring just recently I was starting to do more unilateral work and I will go back and also just being much more particular about form. I think as lifelong exercisers we can compensate a lot. People that are somewhat athletic compensate very well.

[01:21:34] I think I have to hold myself to a much higher standard otherwise I know I will continue to get injured. And also I want to add in more zone too. >> By the way, it's so funny you say that. Um I remember um a trainer and I can't remember who it was. Um but he was showing me videos of some incredible athletes doing workouts and he was just pointing out all of the horrible mistakes they were making and he goes, "They're not great athletes because of how they're training. They can get away with training that way because they are such great athletes." How much did you see that Mike when you were training pros? >> I literally just wrote down the better the athlete, the better the compensator.

[01:22:12] That was a note that I >> Masters of compensation is what we used to call. >> Yeah. I used to look at these guys and think like my god it's amazing what they can get away with at that level. But I want to go back to the adult cuz it's really funny. The squat thing because I wrote an article one time and I forget what I called it but it was basically about slamming your hand in a car door.

[01:22:28] I said if you substituted slamming your hand in a car door for squatting and then had the same conversation with yourself saying, "Hey, I just hurt my hand. I slammed it in the car door and I can't wait till my fingers heal up cuz I'm going to go back and slam my hand in the car door. Right. >> That's what you'd be saying to me in the shower every eighth workout. >> Exactly. We all We've all Exactly. And that's why I wrote the article because people do it all the time. And you just realize that if you just And that's where being rational and substituting something really stupid. >> Although in fairness, the analogy is more like this. The analogy is I love slamming the car door because I love the noise, but I like to also reach in the car when I'm doing it. >> And normally it's fine, but on every eighth slam, >> I might edit the article for that and say, "Okay, even if it was only every eighth time you did it, would you go back and slam the car door eight more times?" >> And you wouldn't. You would be like, "No, that's absolutely stupid. The the riskreward doesn't work." But for some reason, squatting has such kind of I don't know, a visceral attachment in strength and conditioning. And that's why I mean people you should go go look at some of the old YouTube comments about me. The things people were saying about me were unbel, you know, and I was kind of like I'm just >> it's religious, right? >> It's religious. It's absolutely religious. >> Yeah. But but like an exercise like the clean doesn't have that type of religion because I think functionally again everyone can relate to the squat. The squat is something we do every day. every time we get out of a chair, every time we go to the bathroom. So, I think there's that >> point, Jeff, sorry to interrupt, is a very good one, which is people are confusing a goblet squat or effectively a sumo deadlift with a goblet, which is it's all the same hip hinge. They're confusing that with this. This is the unnatural part. I think >> we teach everybody to go squat. We teach everybody to sumo deadlift. But I always tell everybody in people like, well, you know, you got to be able to go to the bathroom. I won't use the indelicate description. And I said, "Yes, but no one, you're not going to piggyback someone in and take a shit." Like, that's not how it's going to work. Like, so you don't have to be able to do that.

[01:24:29] Like, in order to be able to use the bathroom, you only need to be able to bodyweight squat. So, once you can bodyweight squat, you're good. Let's do unilateral stuff for loading because, and this is where we get into adults versus athletes. Like I was people say, "What's an adult? What's an athlete?"

[01:24:42] I'm like, "An adult has a job that does not involve playing sports." So, and I was doing this presentation for perform better. I was writing it up. One of the things is, you know, pickle ball players aren't athletes. Okay. Like people that are adult recreational athletes, they're not athletes because if they get hurt, like you said, you get hurt at 50 or 60, it's really debilitating. You don't heal. Even the rate of healing, you're seeing that now. The rate of healing is totally different. I look at my son and his friends, they'll get hurt and two days later, they'll be like, "I'm fine." >> And I look at them and think, >> "I'd be six months crippled if I did what you did." And people don't see I always say life is this gradual transition of filetmenan to beef jerky right and I'm in the beef jerky stage of life firmly in the beef >> jerk I'm thinking I'm at a New York strip at the moment just getting a little firmer >> but you know you think like you're getting crustier and a little bit more salinated and just you're you're not you're not what you used to be and I actually posted a thing on Instagram they say the number one cause of injury in old men is thinking they are young men and that's why when you get into should They squatch it to death. I always say no because I wrote down ego.

[01:25:51] The problem with that is when you start letting people do these things, you then have to become the ring master in the circus. So for us, we just eliminate the the events. Like, nope, we're not doing those events because I'm not going to be able to figure out, well, you can squat and deadlift, you can't squat and deadlift, you can. It's like, no, if nobody squats and deadlifts in our adult program, then we're we're just better off. And again, our by professional athletes, I had one guy in the Red Sox who squatted, insisted to me after I I really fought with everybody about it.

[01:26:24] Every single guy except one. >> What position? >> Pitcher. >> A pitcher. >> And but a real like a real heester. He was a I mean, he looks like a linebacker. He looked like Brian Erlacer, but he he was like, "No, I have to do this." The rest of the guys were like, "Oh, I'll do the whatever. I'll do split squats. I'll do whatever you want me to do." And but in that situation, I was like, "Okay, our college kids who have to squat squat." So if you came in, someone came in the gym the other day and they were like, "That kid's squatting." They were like looking like, "Oh my god, like so you know, there's a defector in in our midst here." And I was like, "No, he has to squat. He's got to go back to college. He's got to go to his college weight room in his college program. Those kids squat because we want them to be able to to go back to school and be able to participate in the program the way they're supposed to participate." >> I feel like people don't appreciate the nuance of what you're saying. I I feel like it can easily be sort of turned into Mike thinks no one should squat and what you're saying is no, there's a threshold. There's a riskreward trade-off and it it I I completely agree with you. This idea like if you're not getting paid to play a sport, you have to reconsider how you're treating that sport. >> It it's also not as if that the alternatives are sacrifices in terms of what they're delivering. That is the problem. Like I always talk about people get on me because I have what I call the iron graveyard, right? There's a few exercises that just belong in there. And one of them for me is the upright row.

[01:27:45] It's a garbage exercise. It's And you could tell me no, there's no bad exercises. That's a bad exercise. And talk about it. >> Well, it knows what it is. >> So the upright row is when is, you know, done the way that people, you know, old school taught how to do the lift. You hold the barbell and you lift it up here up up under your chin. Your elbows are much higher than your wrists are. You've got lots of weight usually on the exercise. So more fully pushing your arms down to internal rotation. The funny thing about that is that that that position is literally the test as a physical therapist that we would put somebody in to try to see if they have impingement in their shoulder. We put them in this position, push down. If it gets a lot of pain in there, likely something's getting pinched, super spinatus tendon, something. Why am I doing that exercise when? Not because I dislike the I never got hurt on it. I never did. I've did it for years. I've done it for 40 years. There's always the outliers like we talked about before.

[01:28:33] But when I can just simply tell you, I just want you to drop your elbows lower than your wrist. I want you to do something called a high pull. I want you to go this way. By doing that now, instead of internally rotating the shoulder, I'm externally rotating the shoulder. I'm still working my delts. I'm still working my traps. I get zero sacrifice of what I'm trying to do the exercise for in the first place. And I eliminate the part that I don't like, that I don't care if you haven't gotten hurt this time, but ultimately doing it over and over and over again can potentially cause a problem down the road. Even just the potential of it. Not saying that you can't get injured on any exercise, you can. But on on this exercise, I'm lowering the risk and not sacrificing the benefit. I think when when Mike talks about squatting, the fact is if you can do something that's giving you a better or even equal benefit and it takes away some of those down downsides to the exercise, especially as the population who's performing it is less appropriate to be performing the exercise and more appropriate to be doing the alternative.

[01:29:32] What what's what's the whole point? You know, it makes me think about how do we re-educate people because we've all suffered from these narratives of you have to squat, you have to deadlift, and it's just similar to nutrition. Do you think that there's a way, if I can ask, do you think there's a way that we re-educate getting to our youth potentially, so the younger that we can educate, the less likely we're going to have adults in their 50s having to have serious injuries. And then Mike, you won't have to have this conversation about no more squatting. >> No, I think we're doing it right now, actually. I mean, these things are really the our the ability to mass-produce this and to have people hear it and see it is something that we weren't really able to do before. I I talk about the fact when I was a kid coming up, I had to wait for the new

[01:30:20] Strength and Health to come out to the news stand. And I I mean, I waited I visited the news stand by these mags absolutely I waited for Strength and Health and Iron Man. I would walk into the store and I would say, "Did those magazines come in?" The guy would be like, "Nope, they're not in yet." Cuz that was our only connection to the training world. >> And now you think, you know, you've got 14 million subscribers or something like that on YouTube. And I had someone ask one time, say, "What's the greatest thing you've seen or the greatest change in strength and conditioning?" And I was like, "The computer." And they were like, "What do you mean?" I was like, "There was no computer." >> Such a good point. And and so you start thinking we've got this ability now, podcasts, YouTube, we can educate people, but our problem is that we copy dumb people. There's too many dummies on the internet and not enough people. I've taken a little bit more in my old age to kind of calling out the

[01:31:12] Sometimes I'll just say on Twitter that's a bad that's a bad take because if you don't then people get to establish themselves as experts because this is the loudest voice situation now in terms of who's going to who's going to influence and now there's a lot of AI like if you look at Twitter's got all these AI things going that are showing people and sometimes I'll just write total garbage and I'll just click and send the reply and because I'm like it's total garbage this is like it it shouldn't be on the internet it shouldn't be anywhere

[01:31:42] And uh so but I'm going to be that I guess I'm going to probably >> we need that. >> I mean close to the grumpy old man stage like you when your grandfather would say inappropriate things at meals. I'm I'm like I'm I'm inches away. >> Um Jeff, give us a couple more things in the graveyard. >> Oh, what else do I have in the U um

[01:32:01] Cuban press for the same reason, which is when the elbows, you know, the arms come down and then press from there. It's kind of an unnecessary adaptation that we don't need. Um, what else do I have in the graveyard? Um, I'm drawing a blank. I had at least five or six in the Oh, the chest fly. I I put the unsupported bench fly in the graveyard simply because probably because of my history working with with pitchers and knowing how susceptible the the shoulder capsule can become from chronic overstretching. And then we apply a load in that position at the same time. And even our >> whereas a fly machine would be safer because you're not load much safer and and and um and or we'll do like a we'll do a floor fly. So the floor fly we're getting the eentric overload. Matter of fact, the benefit of a floor fly is that you're going to have the safety net of about here on the floor and I could use a heavier weight. So if I if I'm doing the exercise because I like the eccentric overload I get on it. Um I can actually apply a little bit more weight, a little bit more eentric stress to the chest because the benefit of the exercise is the stretch of the exercise.

[01:33:09] So I can apply a heavier load but in a much safer and and again my shoulders aren't going to be vulnerable there too. Um, but again that's a because it's an Arnold favorite and it's an Arnold Classic and I believe he tore his pack once on the fly. So, it's like, you know, it was his favorite, but it did have repercussions for him, too. It's just not a uh it's it's not something that I believe you can't reproduce the benefits of in other ways. Again, I nothing is in my graveyard that doesn't have an alternative that's equally good.

[01:33:41] The only reason why I would ever throw an exercise into that category is because there's something that could be done that just eliminates some of that risk that's just as good in terms of delivering what it's supposed to deliver. So, um yeah, I mean it's not an extensive graveyard, but people are very vocal about their favorites when one finds their way into that graveyard and you have to sort of explain your way out of it. >> I want to talk a little bit about kids.

[01:34:05] So, um I have three kids. They all love playing sports. Um, but one of them in particular has has taken a real love of baseball, the youngest. So, he just turned eight about a month ago. And I I grew up never playing baseball. It's not It just wasn't a sport that was particularly popular where I grew up. I have to say it. I have become obsessed with baseball. I can really fully understand how people can get obsessed with this sport. It's not just the numbers and the data. There's just there's so much art in nuance in like learning about all these different pitches and how they hold the ball and all this kind of stuff. Okay. But, you know, we live in we live in a world now, it seems, where uh coaches want kids to specialize earlier and earlier. And I was a little bit surprised at the end of his seven-year-old seat. Like, you know, they're playing three seasons a year, by the way, in baseball right now, right?

[01:35:03] So you've got fall ball, spring ball, and then like there's this like little summer ball tournament. And the kids are playing one position now. Um, and most of the kids have a coach, an a coach outside of like a position coach outside of the team. Now, my intuition is that just doesn't make sense. So So what what tell me what you guys think of that.

[01:35:32] Do you have a soap box available um for for me to jump up on? Absolutely. One, I always say follow the money, right? If you look at most of these people that are telling you that kids need year- round sports are people who are making their living from year- round sports. If you look at what most professional athletes are doing, they're not doing that with their kids. If you look at what most coaches are doing, they're not doing that with their kids. What you usually find is some entrepreneur who has developed Joe's baseball and he needs income year round because he doesn't have Joe's baseball and lacrosse. He just has Joe's baseball. So as a result they're they start telling you they start giving you that early specialization myth like hey you got to get started early and if you get started early you do better and if you you get seen early I just saw somebody Twitter the other day somebody said that you know scouting starts now at 10U. This was a woman who runs uh a softball development program. And I just I literally I typed it. I said, "No, that's that's absolutely bad information."

[01:36:32] It's they start using words like development and exposure. The reality is if you said, "I have an 8-year-old who really likes baseball." The number one thing I would tell you is make him do something else besides baseball. My daughter was a full scholarship ice hockey player. Very, very good. Played a year in the women's professional league.

[01:36:46] Had a scholarship when she was 15 years old. I didn't let her play in a summer tournament until she was 13. And people would say all the time, can Michaela play in this tournament? Can she play in that tournament? I'm like, nope. And they were like, what is what's she doing? Said she's going to go to the lake. She's going to water ski. She's going to be on the swim team. She took up diving one summer because they needed a diver. And she became the U12 diver because she the guy started throwing herself off the diving board and said, "Oh, she's fearless. I'll teach her to dive." And I was like, "How many hours will you take her for?" And he's like, "Oh, a couple hours a week." I was like, "Awesome."

[01:37:17] But so I we made her do that. We made her play soccer. She did judo. She was state judo champion when she was 12. The kids that are better athletes do better in the long run. You end up with there's a whole early succeeder phenomenon that we deal with. And early succeeders generally they won the uh the genetic

[01:37:36] Olympics. They generally tend to be from uh from groups that that develop earlier and they will tend to be ahead when they for us from in my years it was the Greeks and the Italian kids. They always mature. They they were the ones that were shaving in junior high school and they were much better in junior high at football than the rest of us were because they weighed 190 lbs and we weighed 130 lbs. And you just look at that and think that's not going to have any bearing on the end. You have to look this is the literal marathon versus sprint argument in terms of you've got to look at this and think no this is a this is a developmental marathon and the kids who sample tend to do better like your kid loves baseball now but you don't necessarily know that that will be my son loved hockey he's playing college lacrosse he was playing baseball and lacrosse at the same time and eventually we realized >> and do you feel this way even if the kid is themselves wanting to play all the time would you sort of force the kid >> yeah I forced my daughter my daughter was hockey only she That's all I want to do. And I said, I don't care. >> So, she was not thrilled about the idea that you weren't letting her play in a summer tournament. >> Yep. Angry at times with me, fights about why can't I do this? Because she knew she could go and be the best player. And I said, I don't care if you're the best player when you're 12. I care if you're the best player when you're 18. Uh, and so being the best player at 12, I'm not getting any ego gratification by going to this tournament and realizing that you made the 12-year-old allstars or something like that. So, yeah, we had fights. We had fights about soccer. I made her play her view 14 years soccer and I did. But the specialization thing I always think up to 12 broadest sampling possible. The more things they can possibly do, the better. The more because we're trying to develop general athletic attributes.

[01:39:16] You'll see the kids in hockey that played soccer because they're kids that can pick up pucks in their feet. My son picked up lacrosse really fast because he played baseball and he played hockey and he understood the whole idea. Oh, we score. There's a net. I can catch things extended. All that stuff made perfect sense to him when he went to lacrosse and lacrosse ended up coming together.

[01:39:35] But if you weren't sampling, you don't know. You just think I always say, this is a terrible analogy, but I'm going to use it anyway. I said, if your son came to you and said, "I really like cocaine at this point. It's the only thing that I want to do." You would be like, "No, we're not going to do that." Right? But suddenly, because you >> you have to do a little heroin. You have to do a little I would like you to drink a few beers. I just don't want you to be

[01:39:56] But you know what I If you substitute just because they want to do it. >> You substitute that for baseball. You think you you like I'm I like absurd analogies, but I think there you see the absurdity of that and you think, yeah, you love baseball, that's great, but hey, you really should, you know, you should learn to swim and you really should learn to do some sort of, you know, sport that involves your feet. You know, you should play soccer. You should

[01:40:20] I think, you know, kids should do I think some sort of combative sport is really good for kids because you should learn what it's like. Like it's really funny. My took my daughter to the instructors when my daughter was doing judo were Ronda Rousey and Kayla Harrison which like what are the odds that you go to the best judo school in

[01:40:35] America that is 15 minutes from your house and that's who's teaching the classes in judo. So my daughter can still say that you know she was taught by Ronda Rousey and Kayla Harrison. But having to go out on a mat and fight another kid I fight's the word I guess right is really good for a 12-year-old girl. And that feeling I remember her looking at me the first time like you know and I'm like sorry I can't come out like you're on you're on your own you better figure it out and she did. So I just you sampling is the key and specialist specialization if we can think of the worst possible thing you can do for your kid it is to let them specialize even if it gets to the point where they think dad I don't like you you're mean you're you're not a good person because you're not letting me do what I want to do. You've got to look at them and think that's why I'm the parent. That's why I'm in charge. Sorry, soap box. Uh, soap box down. I'll let somebody else talk. >> I will say that our kids are both in gymnastics and jiu-jitsu. My daughter hates jiu-jitsu and she excels in gymnastics. And we chose gymnastics because it allows for her fine motor skills, all of this development very young, and also the development of her musculature. She's and again, she loves it. And we know that the healthier, fitter, and more active these kids are, the greater their metabolic health as adults is. But um to your point, what we see is I think in the US we see a lot more injuries than in other places because of this always having a season and um from a standpoint of longevity definitely again make our kids do the same thing. I don't know why we haven't stopped and questioned it a little bit sooner because it's not like injury rates are going down. So, we're playing more and getting injured more. Like that's what we've seen um across all levels of sport. Mike and I were discussing the Achilles tendons and the rash of Achilles tendon injuries or at least it seems to be in prominent players. Um but a lot of it has to go back to just the the the repetitions and the mileage. One thing that Mike brought up that I thought was really interesting was the way the style that the game is played now, let's say basketball, there's so much more because it's really come down, chuck up a three, go down, chuck up a three, come down, check.

[01:42:50] There's a lot a lot less of that inside game going on. The game is faster and they run more and there's a lot more mileage. How many miles extra was it? >> 200 more miles a year per team, >> right? Just because just the way the style of the game is played >> and they're not all linear miles. They're start, stop, start, stop, start, stop. So there's a lot of cumulative stress on the Achilles tendon doing that that can you know again on top of the fact that that as as as teenagers they were playing all year long too not like it used to be when Larry Bird was playing when he played his season and he probably went home and and did something completely different. Um I or just just shot around a little bit. So the we need to start looking at these extensive seasons and these multiple seasons per year because it's not changing. It's not helping. If it if it was helping, we wouldn't have all these athletes being injured. Things are worse now than they've ever been. >> Same more about the Achilles. That that is the injury I personally fear the most at this point. Um because um when you're, you know, I play with my kids a ton, right? So, it's usually soccer and baseball that we're playing.

[01:43:56] Uh, and especially with soccer, I'm always worried like, is this going to be the day when despite all of the training I do, despite all the jumping, despite all the multilateral training I'm always doing, I don't know what it is. I think I've just seen so many of them. It's the injury that keeps me up at night is like

[01:44:14] I'm just literally diving for a soccer ball and >> it's the beef jerky injury, right? I mean, that's >> what What is the protocol? How do you how do you think about maximizing the odds of survival? Um, >> rolling and stretching one. I I'm a huge foam roll and stretch person. I think everybody should be rolling. Everybody should be stretching. Everybody should be doing >> so specifically talking about the solus.

[01:44:40] You're talking about rolling all the way down onto the tendon. >> Okay. So, you're talking about calf >> calf and then doing, you know, just ankle mobility work, basic ankle rocks. And then now the it's really interesting because this way you talk about dogma, right? All of a sudden, the front foot elevated stuff is becoming popular. And when you think about from a preventative standpoint, it makes perfect sense. We were always told, you have to have your whole foot on the ground. Like that's the correct technique. If you're on your feet, >> you say front foot elevated. Do you mean like toe on a >> plate? Like toe on a plate kind of thing. But >> but initially when I first saw that, I was like, I don't get it. And then a physical therapist friend of mine, David

[01:45:14] Gray, was like, yeah, well, if you want to get your foot engaged and you want to get your gastrock engaged, it just makes sense to put your foot on there. And that's where some of the stuff it always goes back to. I when I wrote functional training for sports and they asked me to define it, I said functional training is training that makes sense when you think about things. So that's why when you were talking about flies like flies don't make any sense to me. I said unless you're a professional face slapper, I don't know why you would do flies. So like we don't do >> still probably better on the pack deck. >> We don't we don't do that. Like I look and think I don't know why you would do that. Maybe if you were like, you know, if you went to University of Florida, like if there was there are certain things where you might be required to perform that action, but you have to look at stuff. >> But from a hypertrophy standpoint, there's a lot of reasons to do it, right? I mean, it adds it there's a there's a there's something you must be getting out of that movement uh that you can't get out of just that movement.

[01:46:05] Correct. >> Yeah. Well, I mean, you look at the the amount of abduction that you're getting. So, any press, any dip, any push-up, it's all limited to about this range of motion. But if I can actually open it up even further and get more stretch, we know the benefit hypertrophy wise of of applying stretch to a muscle. But that's a that's an exercise where you are also entertaining end range shoulder mobility and then again excess stress on the anterior capsule. So like >> so it's like if you're a bodybuilder, if you're a if you're a if you're a wrestler, like if you're in certain sports where the aesthetic >> matters, it could be right. It could be the difference between first and second place if you're a competitive bodybuilder. Um, but that's not that's not my world. And and I think that at least educating people about what those risks might be um is at least an important first step to having the discussion of whether they should do it or not. And again, if I if I can provide an alternative for them where I think you could get additional benefits without the risk, then then why do it? >> What what else do you think is important in the playbook of minimizing the risk of the Achilles injury? I I was when

[01:47:08] Mike said mobility, I think ankle mobility is something that we don't no one pays attention to their ankles. We don't we don't try to mobilize our ankles at all. I think that um tight calves are are common in people and they don't really ever address them and and it all starts at the ground. Everything starts at the ground. If you have any compensation, if you lack ankle mobility, um your knee is going to pay the price for sure cuz the knee, I always say the knee is like that consequential joint in between the hip and the foot. And it's just reacting to what's happening above and below. And the poor knee, my knees in in particular, like they got beat up and they never really were to blame. Um all they were trying to do is just hinge back and forth and they couldn't do a good job because they were being betrayed by flat feet and weak hips. Um, but I think if people pay more attention to strengthening their hips and to mobilizing their ankles, um, you can feed that chain up and down. And if your calf isn't tight or if your mo your ankle is more mobile, then there's less of that tension being put placed down through the tendon itself, um, you're already doing a big to take a step forward in terms of decreasing your risk of actually snapping that thing. And in terms of strengthening the calf, do we think the soius or the gastro plays a greater role? Do you need both? Do you need to have both knee bent and knee straight? >> We always we always focus on both. And like a lot of people will always talk about the the gastro specific strengthening with the knee straight just because it's like the one that gives you the the the the better contraction, right? But um I think we don't I don't care about that. I care about making sure that all the muscles in the body are strengthened. So, we'll do equal amounts of seated versus standing calf raises. So, if you're doing three sets in a day of standing, you're doing three sets seated as well.

[01:48:53] So, every time we program calf training, it's seated and standing together. Um, but I don't think one versus the other is more responsible for for the tears. I think as a as a group together the our ankles are lacking mobility and because the ankles are lacking mo we've talked about like in sleeping and sleeping at night you know your feet are down and especially if you have like if you keep those those those blankets tight at the end of your bed they're down quite a bit and you're spending six seven eight hours in that position like you're not doing yourself any favor in terms of you know encouraging mobility at the ankle and mo and flexibility through calves.

[01:49:33] So, it just needs to have we need to be much more aware of those of those areas and do more work towards that. And again, that's part that's more work that people have to do. And when you're talking about from the very beginning when we're saying, "What do I have to do to be in shape or what do I have to do?"

[01:49:47] Sometimes you have to own little mini parts of your program because specific to you, they're they're important. So, for you, this big fear of that Achilles tendon tear, which I I I'm right there with you. I think it's a it's just a a devastating injury that will take you out for quite a while. um that would be part of your program that you have to add another five minutes of mobility work for your ankle and and and do that three four times a week to make sure that you're you're you're doing something about it. That starts to add up and people start making choices and their choices. Okay, I'm cutting all the little stuff because that's not going to really no one's going to see my ankle development. So, they're they want to see my my arms or my chest or something. So, they're going to do more work there. But when you make those decisions to cut those little parts of the program, those are the ones that usually keep you injury-free. >> Speaking of single leg, you know, the difference between doing um uh calf raises with two feet versus single leg.

[01:50:41] That that was one of the most profound eye openeners for me was the the difference in in strength and how much less weight you could do one leg at a time. It's not half the weight. Like there's some sort of interesting compensation when you're doing it two legs at a time. And we find we started that adding that back into our adult program. We never put calf work in and then suddenly we started thinking I remember trying to do some calf raises and I was so sore and I thought my god.

[01:51:05] But again you realize that it's kind of a use it and lose it or use it or lose it scenario where if you're no longer sprinting and jumping then that the the flexibility that you know the the mobility of that complex and the ability of that thing to absorb force. But the other two things, one, uh, if avoid doing it if your calves are sore because if you look at both Tatum and

[01:51:29] Hellbertton had previous calf strains that they were playing with and ended up with Achilles tendon tears and I think sometimes um, again I'm a I'm a meme guy. There was a great meme yesterday and the guy said the doctor was like, "How much does that hurt?" And he said, "Oh, the usual amount." And the doctor said, "The usual amount is zero." Right?

[01:51:47] So, you've got to be able to look at that and realize that like it shouldn't hurt at all. If you're thinking, "Oh, my my calves, my shins, they're sore." That's indicating to you that you were doing something that wasn't kind and that now you've got to give that enough time to recover so that that's not sore anymore. And I think sometimes we get into the kind of I don't know the the hard guy stuff in terms of you got to like I never I tell everybody I I wrote an article one time called Does it hurt?

[01:52:14] And I said it's all about the idea that does it hurt is a yes no question. And if I ask you, does it hurt? You can only answer yes or no. And any equivocation is yes. When you well, after I warm up, yes or only yes. And I always do that with people when they start qualifying. I'm like, yeah, that's a yes. So how much does it hurt? You know, people bench press after I warm up. It doesn't hurt at all. I'm like, well, that means it hurts. It's you can't. And so we're like for us, we don't do anything. >> You're using that then as a sign that says I need to understand why it hurts.

[01:52:42] It's not you don't train. It's we need to figure out what's going wrong. What's your movement pattern >> and figure out what you know Jeff was alluding to like you know upright rows and rotator cuff like what is it >> that's making your shoulders sore >> what's the movement that's aggravating and for some people like we find that standing you know people it's functional standing cable pressing is the one thing that everybody can do that doesn't hurt so if we have people with shoulder pain they standing cable press because it's the one thing they can do that doesn't hurt and I don't care whether people think functional, non-functional, you can label it any way you want to label it, but I just know I can get you to press painf free. And my goal, that's my goal all the time. I want to be able, you can look at me and say, I can do that and it doesn't hurt at all. Then I think, okay, we can build off that. >> What people don't understand, too, is that it's okay to go through periods of restriction to a single movement like that, right? A standing cable press to actually allow the shoulder to heal to a point where you actually could get back to doing other variants of the press if that was your desire. Um, I told you a story myself where I had a I have a labor room tear and I had a inability to do any type of pressing. I had to restrict myself simply to a variation of a of a crossover that um it wasn't even a pure crossover but just something that

[01:53:59] I could do where I could actually pull in a little bit and then cross over my body cuz that was the only thing I could do pain free but I could still work my chest in a way that you know allowed me to do to do something. I also knew that I could do something completely different. Like I could I could horizontal row. By doing that, I'm getting shoulder movement in a way that was different, right? It's almost like the specialization in sport, like not just doing all chest stuff, but trying to actually attack the chest through a different way by still looking at the shoulder joint. And I would do a lot a lot of rowing, which probably was good just posturally to balance out some of the the imbalance I had in the shoulder, but also to just give me more joint range of motion in the shoulder. I'm getting all this extension. But the combination of those two things got me to a point where my shoulder doesn't I got to knock on wood now, but my shoulder doesn't hurt. I can actually be able to go and and go back to pressing again in a smart way with dumbbells. I don't I don't barbell bench press, but I do it with dumbbells. And I have none of the pain that I had years ago when that was going on. So, it's okay to to understand that this is a long game and you might want to take a step back and and stay with the exercises that don't cause pain and allow yourself a chance to be actively mobile to still recover at the same time um instead of sitting on the sidelines like you said, which is not a a preferred choice. That's not going to turn out well. want to pivot and talk a little bit about um strength training women across kind of the transition from pmenopause into menopause. Do you have any experience with that? I'm guessing you do. And

[01:55:31] Mike, you must just by the fact that they're coming in your So start with you Gabriel. What what do you what are you noticing is the most important things as women are making the transition from pmenopause straight on into menopause? The first thing is to don't don't wait until they start to feel that their body composition is changing. The fitter they are going into pmenopause and menopause, the better they're going to be both metabolically and just activities of daily life, everything. Those women seem to suffer much less. When hormones are changing, I think what I end up seeing is that maybe sleep is poor, their tendons, you know, one of the signs of menopause is this frozen shoulder.

[01:56:15] So if someone is a candidate for HRT, we do certainly believe in that or um menopause u therapy. When it comes to training in the literature, I haven't seen huge evidence or a variation evidence that good training doesn't incl. There is not something specific for women that needs to happen rather than following good foundational principles of strength training, hypertrophy and cardiovascular activity. >> So you don't say, "Hey, now that you're making this transition, we have to alter your periodization or change the way change the amount of time you're spending doing one form of training, say cardio versus resistance, or even the number of reps you would do. We're not changing any of that stuff." I don't um one of the things that we do look at though is if they are at risk for injury for tendons or joints because we do see that that changes but then once we treat them um I do not see a reason to change.

[01:57:17] Good programming is good programming. Progressive stimulus is progressive stimulus. >> No. No, it was great cuz when I read your book, it was very reinforcing for me cuz where I'm getting that question more and more now from our female clients just because because of people like you who are talking about it more, people are more comfortable then talking to us about it. And it's exactly that.

[01:57:38] It's the whole thing I I always come back it always comes back to strength and conditioning, right? Get stronger, get in better shape, get them to challenge themselves more with weights and not be content. The females are very I always think there's there's an ego component that's absent in females that is very present in in males. Like males will look at, you know, if I looked at what Jeff did, I might think, "Oh, I'm going to try that." Females just don't have that. They're just very internally driven and sometimes that will cause them to underachieve in the weight room because they're not they're not worried about being top dog. They're not worried about who lifted the most weight. It just isn't >> makes them better snipers, you know. >> I believe it. It makes them better clients. Trust me. If I could I would do nothing. I have a lot of really elite females like that are great hockey players and lacrosse players and stuff and they're the best people to train by far because they don't have a lot of the kind of extra baggage sometimes that the guys have. They're just way more compliant. They just listen to what you say. They don't argue with you. They don't again they're not worried about what Jeff is doing. But just encouraging them to continually get stronger and encouraging them to continue to and we would look at it as conditioning versus cardiovascular work. That's just kind of how we always use the term, but pushing them to to do more intervals. Pushing them to do I want more >> aggressive intervals. So, you know, you want to call it a V2 max workout, but >> I want to get that like I loved Andy

[01:58:59] Galpin's idea like Andy Galpin's thing was like, hey, you just want to get your heart rate up really high once a week. >> I think that's a really good concept. And starting to just get people to think, hey, get your heart rate up. Wear a heart rate monitor. Don't be afraid to push your heart rate to uh to X, you know, whatever that is. And don't be afraid to be, you know, out of breath or get off the bike and feel like you want to land on the floor kind of thing cuz we're big assault bike aerodyine people because it's just the I think it's the most efficient way to to hit your cardiovascular system with what I would call no orthopedic cost. Like I can kill you on the bike and nothing bad is going to happen. >> Even like you were saying with the hamstring, I'm going to bet you can going to be able to bike with that ham. planning on trying it later today. >> And then you'll be perfectly fine because you're non you're nonweightbearing and you're not getting a lot of aggressive hip extension and a lot of aggressive hip flexion and you can probably torture yourself on there for a long time without having any negative effects. But the biggest thing, like I said, with women is just getting them over that

[01:59:58] I'm going to get big so I don't push myself kind of thing. And so it's funny, I film a lot of my women and ask them to talk about how much they weigh and how much weight they've haven't gained because I have I have two of the best lacrosse attackers on our US team that are in their mid20s now and they've been here for 5 years and they've gained no weight. They're stronger, they're faster. But females gaining lean mass is really difficult. You have to really be a super responder. >> And usually I always say apples end up like apples, oranges end up like oranges. It's not like suddenly one day the apple is going to wake up and the the next day going to be an orange. Like you're going to be if you're an ectomorph, you're an ectomorph.

[02:00:35] You will get the occasional really messorphic female where you do think, "Oh, wow. She really does respond to weights." But they're rare. They're super rare. >> So Jeeoff, what about you? What are you seeing in women specifically that you're training, especially during that transition uh through menopause? >> I I think as Gabriel pointed out, like the training specifics are are pretty much the same. what applies and what is good smart training for for men is equally uh applicable to women. Um the only thing that I would say from a a PT standpoint biomechanically there are some differences in terms of something called the Q angle, right? The the the angle of the hip or the femur coming down to the knee. It does create a lot more VGUS at the knee for for women than than uh than it does for for men. So I think you just have to be aware of those things. So when you're doing certain activities, you want to be able to coach better in terms of being aware of positioning. So like the tendency for a lot of women when they jump is to land in a in a much more vgous knee state, which could put more and more stress.

[02:01:35] And even if it's not like we're not fearful of them blowing out in a training session, but as we talked about before, that cumulative stress of every time you land, you're getting more and more stress on the MCL or the ACL. That would be something that you'd want to coach around and make them aware of because you could strengthen that. You could work on biomechan biomechanically improving those things. You know, you put a band around their knees and have them jump that way and land that way.

[02:01:59] They're they're learning how to activate their abductors and their hip. Um that is probably something that isn't even really a require. We all men could benefit from that, but it's not an additional requirement because we're not dealing with the same biomechanical angles. Also um because of of hormones, women will have more laxity of hormones at different times of the month that will be make them susceptible to different stresses. So I think you just have to be aware of the education side of it and and coaching through that. But as far as the exercises, the programming, um, we also found that, you know, women just tend to be much stronger than men in terms of their their their output pound-forpound and and given the the differences in sex, they're able to proportionally push more weight, especially with their lower body, than men can. >> So interesting. Yeah, very strong. Much much stronger. Have you found that, too,

[02:02:50] Mike? the the women are are incredibly strong in terms of their their their output and strength comparative to to men. When you >> I really thought about it in terms of pound-for-pound. The one thing we found is that they're much stronger in their upper body than they think they are. That's the one thing that we've seen is that we got more We've got women doing >> weighted chins with set, you know, 45 lbs for five >> and >> what? >> Oh, yeah. Our best one is the 45 for seven is the best I've seen. >> 45 lbs wrapped around her waist and she's doing seven chin-ups. Carpenter who's >> how many men can do that? >> Uh every in our gym we we really emphasize it like most of ours. >> Wow. >> My son's did 90 for two the other day.

[02:03:30] He weighs 180. A bunch of kids on his team. We really pushed we push pulling. That doesn't sound right. But we emphasize pulling. >> We like to push pulling. >> Yes. We like to Yeah. That I'm leading the league in redundancy. >> I want to come back to something you said at the outset, Mike. You were talking about kids. The youngest you train is 11. You drew a hard line in the sand. How come? I always say I don't want to be in the childhood stealing business. And I think there's some people in our industry that are in the childhood stealing business. I want I think kids should be kids and they don't need a strength and conditioning coach when they're 7 8 9 10 years old. They probably need a playground and a bike and a swing set and a slide. There's a lot of things that kids could be doing that are way more fun than being in my gym. So we we actually drew the line at 12 initially, but the sports brackets are 1112. So when we realized that we drew the line at 12, people then started coming and wanted to bring a team and suddenly it was kind of like, well, take

[02:04:22] Peter, but Jeff can't come because he's 11. So eventually we kind of >> bumped it down and then we just resisted bumping it down more >> because I don't want to run a a kinder gym kind of program. I don't want people running around. I don't want birthday parties. That's not what I'm looking to do. So we just said 11. I think at 11 you're going into middle school. you can start to understand that there may be some commitment involved in terms of hey if I want to make a team I'm going to probably have to learn to work at this thing and I'm going to have to learn to train and it's a very good if you kind of look at the um long-term athletic development models that 112 is a good learn to train age to get kids in and get them kind of oriented to hey here's how you do the exercises and we're very learn to train oriented at that stage I tell our coaches all the time I don't care if any of these kids get stronger I could care less I really care that they're good lifters If they've been here 10 weeks and by the end I can look at them and think, "Wow, they can go squat and they can sumo deadlift and they can do a clean and they can do a chin-up and they can do a push-up." Then >> missioning. I mean, all of that is is fantastic, right? And again, it still flies in the face of what many people would think, which is, "Oh my god, an 11year-old lifting weights, it's going to stunt their growth. Mike, aren't you crazy?" >> And that's the be that's what that really I literally wrote that down. It's funny you hit That was in my notes in the beginning, but the misconception stuff. We're still dealing with the stunted growth thing. And you'd brought up New York Times, but New York Times did an article where they tried to to pull the string on that. Where did the stunted growth thing come from? And it actually came from a study. The only study they could find was on Japanese forced child labor. The kids who were forced into child labor tended to be smaller than their age matched peers >> who were malnourished. >> Right. Exactly. Malnourished and not working at eight in a factory. and as a result but that was sort of but yet you still have doctors people will say I don't you know they talk about growth plate stuff there's no growth plate damage evidence there's none of those things are there and then you talked about gymnastics Gabrielle I always tell people figure skating and gymnastics are 10,000 times more aggressive than anything that we would do in the gym I look at and I I'll get myself in trouble but I always say organized child abuse right I mean it's not even good for kids when you look at what they're trying to do with these young bodies because you need I always think you need little people that rotate, right? I mean, that's the key to those sports. And you look at that and then you think what we're doing in the gym, okay, hold 10 lbs, squat up and down, and that's going to be bad for you, but spin around three times and land is okay. That just that's physics denying, science denying where you look and think, no, I can show you the physics of that is way, way worse. >> So, so what are the things u and this is a question for all of you because y'all have kids. So, um, my my we haven't pushed our boys into we haven't pushed any of our kids. Our daughter just decided at some point she wanted to start lifting weights, so that was great. Um, but our boys kind of like to come in the gym with us. Um, and we just sort of play goofy games with them. So, you're I know you're friends with Joo and Leif and they have this fun little card game that they play where you you get Have you seen this game?

[02:07:24] It's it's basically like you designate what you know what is uh what's a spade, what's a heart, what's a diamond, etc. Like you pick like this is a push-up, this is a burpee, this is a situp, >> and then obviously if you flip it and you get a 10 of that thing, you do 10 of them. If you get a seven, you do seven of them and blah blah. >> So we'll just usually they'll just come in the gym with us and play that game.

[02:07:44] They really see they and this is the problem with boys. >> They want to oneup each other. So, you know, once one of them goblet squats this amount of weight, the next guy wants to go to the heavier kettle bell, and the next guy wants to go to the heavy kettle bell. And actually, I do get a little worried cuz I see their form deteriorate, right? They go into what I call turtle back, right? So, they go from lumbar extension, they start getting into lumbar flexion, and I'm like, "Guys, enough." So, so what what advice would you have for trying to help little boys who want to start lifting?

[02:08:14] Um, but but just you just want them to develop the form. I think it's really funny because if you were to ask them to do to to jump onto something or to or to um even to do like to to walk upstairs two steps at a time, their form usually is going to look quite good when it's just a naturally occurring activity that they're doing in in their life. When you then say, "Hey, let's do this as an exercise. Let's do something called a step-up where we step up onto a box or let's even do a push-up." Right? the push-up, if they were to get themselves off the floor, it would probably look a lot prettier than it does when they ask them to do a push-up. Their their ass is up in the air, their shoulders are wide, they're kind of moving in all different kinds of segments. So, to me, it's this disconnect. It's not that they lack the athletic skills or the strength to do what it is you're asking them to do.

[02:09:03] They lack the awareness of what it is you're asking them to do. So, they don't like when it's packaged as an exercise, they're sort of like not really sure what that is. So it's it's our responsibility to kind of make it seem easy to understand and tell them where they're supposed to be feeling it. You know the number one question that people ask when they are we're starting out an exercise program not just kids anybody when they do an exercise surprisingly because this is what we all do and we are so passionate about it. What am I supposed to work? What am I feeling here? When am I supposed to feel this?

[02:09:33] And to me like well where do you feel it? You know, but that's they want to know cuz they want to know where okay cuz if I'm not feeling it there, what do I have to do to get it to feel to feel it there. Kids need to learn the the proper form and biomechanics of how to do the exercise. Again, I think they possess a lot more athletic skill and natural abilities than we give them credit for. And when we just have them start doing exercises, it breaks down.

[02:09:57] So, take the time, do the exercises, right? Who cares about the weight that's in their hand first? start with body weight and then have them learn the mechanics of that. As I said before with that little drop squat, the drop squat will actually is is where they can actually add weight and and learn better than it could be if they were trying to learn a bodyweight squat. In this case, that that actual implement would assist them in learning how to do it properly because it's just going to take their their center mass straight down. So, the form is everything when it comes to kids. When we've worked with kids in in the 11 to 12 year old bracket, that's what we try to focus on is learn the movement. Go slow, right? Don't speed through it. Go slow. Speed is something that usually breaks down any good any attempt at good form. So, learn the movements and then we could always speed them up and we could always add weight.

[02:10:42] But if you don't learn the form, you're gonna basically set up a foundation that's going to ultimately crack. Especially if they get away with that for their teen years and now they're in their 20s and then really now all that competition starts to to kick in and you know competing with your buddies and then things get really ugly. >> And are either of you guys doing sports specific training for these 12y olds?

[02:11:01] For example, if you got a 12-year-old who's a pitcher versus a 12-year-old who's a basketball player, are you having them do different exercises? >> No, nothing. I don't I think sports specific training I always I always say sports specific training is It's absolutely nonsense. Baseball is sports specific training. Like if you want to go get better at baseball then go play baseball. If you come to the weight room I mean I've trained guys in every major professional sport. And it's at most 8020 probably 9010. Like 90% of what we do is the same 10% of what we do is different. And that 10% is totally irrelevant to a 8 n 10 11 12y old. It makes absolutely no difference. It could it >> that's really counterintuitive. I would thought that I mean god if you're a pitcher you've got to be taking more care of the rotator cuff than maybe the guy who's you know than you know the hockey player for example, >> right? And that's that would be the 10% literally like the 10% with baseball would be that shoulder care stuff that you might not really worry about with your hockey players or your football players. So there's going to be that's where your difference in programming would be like that one spot. >> Mhm. >> Rotator cuff. But with kids like I always look at and think you shouldn't be a pitcher. You're not a pitcher.

[02:12:12] You're a baseball player and you might end up being a catcher. You might end up being a shortstop cuz again I've had so many Nomar Garcia par. No Garcia par went to Georgia Tech and tried to kick on the football team >> and and he Yeah. And he loves soccer. He married me a ham. He's a huge soccer fan. He told me one time I used to train him. said, "I would absolutely be playing soccer if I didn't live in the

[02:12:34] United States." He said, "But I realized the best kind of the best use use of my athleticism was Major League Baseball and that playing in the MLS would never have, you know, given me the type of career that I would have had in Major League Baseball. But most every great athlete that I've seen was a great multisport athlete. But we've got this self-fulfilling prophecy now of specialization where people can now point and they'll they'll point to Tiger

[02:12:56] Woods or somebody and say, "Oh, Tiger Woods specialize." And it's like yeah there's a you can find me one specialist I can find you a thousand generalists who all have achieved and but you'll continue to use the specialist as the example because that's what you want to believe. We as achievementoriented people, like for you to be a great doctor, for you to be a great doctor, for you to be great at YouTube, that's what you got to do.

[02:13:19] Kids, it's the polar opposite. For them to be great at something down the road, they probably need this super broad-based skill set that's going to eventually allow them, you know, the the base of the pyramid versus the height of the pyramid. The bigger the base, the larger the height. You know, if you build an obelisk out of the gate, you're probably not going to accomplish much.

[02:13:39] So, >> you mentioned Carl Crawford, like he didn't he didn't get those scholarship offers for three different sports because he started playing at 18 or 17. He obviously was playing all those sports at a at a young age and getting in developing all those athletic skills to where he could select the one that was most appropriate for him either financially or and he was just the best.

[02:13:58] Some of this is genetic lottery. Carl Crawford could do a standing backflip at 230 lbs. you I've never seen he's still the most the most athletic person I've ever seen but he would have been that in any number of sports I don't think you know just the fact that he chose baseball and that's what's interesting in terms of people say oh you look at the Europeans you know they specialize in soccer and it's like yeah cuz they don't have the choices that we have over here we've got a lot of opportunities that maybe aren't present in other countries so people will kind of people cherrypick because they want to support their their thesis >> but to me the more important certain thing is like virtually no kid is going to be a professional athlete, right? So, so it it you know my interest is in how do you use the interest in sports first to fuel the spark that says lifelong activity is an important pillar of health. Second, how do I make sure that when you are done playing sports, which for most people is the end of high school, then there's a narrow subset that'll say, well, actually it's the end of college. And then there's virtually nobody who's playing sports after that because to your point, pickle ball with your buddies on Sunday, that ain't sports. So, we all stopped playing sports pretty young and yet we are going to need to train for the rest of our lives. And um I think that's the thing that I'm still trying to better understand is how do we use youth sports as a tool to set you up to be an athlete for life where the sport changes to life? And I think that's the difference in terms of using it to teach life lessons. You know, they say sports can build character or can build characters. You have to use it uh to to build the kids character. And sometimes that may be saying you're not just going to get what you want. I I get it that you just like baseball, but we're going to play soccer in the spring because we think you need to be exposed to more things. and the kid learns that lesson like because sometimes they they just learn this kind of micro focus really early on and then later on when they don't achieve they think oh if I I wish I'd done more things I wish I'd sampled more I wish

[02:16:09] I'd explored more I think the it's just it's looking at the real body of evidence versus looking at the evidence that's presented to you by the person who's trying to get your money which is what usually happens now sadly >> the issue I think though is that where we're going off track is that the coaches and the parents of these children are overemphasizing the importance of what it is they're actually competing in to the point where they that why do you think we have you said because of money that we have all these additional leagues throughout the year but it's also because everyone thinks their kid's going to be a pro when they're not >> and they don't want their kid to be left behind >> that too and it's there's all these social pressures behind this you know and I think that is what's feeding that is what's feeding the problems that we see and also taking away from the the fact that this is introducing lifelong habits to them to the point where is it's degenerating something that should be very positive into something that becomes at worst destructive because you're you're you're over you're overdoing something and you're actually a lot of times also making a lot of these kids hate athletics by the time they're 17 18 19. Yeah, that that's another issue which is I can't tell you the number of people I met who grew up collegiate swimming who cannot stand swimming and it's such a shame because swimming is I mean while it's not good for bone density it's pretty much good for everything else. So, by itself, I would say it's not the only exercise you should do, but boy, if I think about if there's one exercise I could insert into everybody's life, it would be some amount of swimming. And uh yeah, somebody who swam through high school and college, they'll they're like, I just I could never do it again. >> It was my best sport. I went to the first swimming meeting at Springfield

[02:17:49] College, and the coach, I still remember, read Sylvia, famous division three coach, the first words out of his mouth were the first practice is at. And I was thinking, he's talking per day here right now. They p they're swimming twice a day. They're swimming before school and after school. And I sat politely through the whole meeting like this and nodded and went to the football meeting and tried over freshman football cuz I was like there is no way I'm going in the pool twice a day. It was the end of my swimming career. And I now I terrible shoulders. I don't even I can't stand swimming because it hurts. You know, I think uh when you're talking about becoming a lifelong athlete that for us, so again, our kids are four and five. They train with us. They might not be doing the same lifts, but we let them play with a um you know, kettle bell, pick things up, put them down, and we let them run. We let them do things that they would physically be able to do without a lot of queuing. And as I just think about some of the data on tendon health, we know that the earlier people start, the better and more resilient those tendons are because they're not starting later in life, not getting injured. Um, and I just think again it's just a great place to start. The earlier the better, which is a bit counterintuitive because we've heard all of this information how kids shouldn't lift weights or train. And maybe it's not a standardized training program, but they're in there. They're doing stuff with us like every day. So, I want to ask you guys each the same question. Um, if you think back to um the last five years, you're obviously all in a constant state of learning. Um, is there something you have changed your mind on?

[02:19:26] Something significant that you've changed your mind on? And not just changed your mind on, but it's changed the way you behave, the way you help other people. I'll start with you, Gabrielle. >> This is a big one. I don't think body fat percentage is nearly as important as we think it is. I think that it is going to be somewhat of an outdated metric. I believe that interuscular atapost tissue this IMAT is going to be much more predictive of disease and this came from I interviewed on my podcast

[02:19:57] Melanie Cree and we were talking about PCOS and I'm thinking metabolic PCOS what is the body fat percentage that's going to change the outcome and she looked at me she goes Gabrielle it has nothing to do with body fat percent it had to do with their interuscular atapost tissue And that I think is going to be an upcoming theme. It's much more specific to insulin resistance and these metabolic outcomes that we care about. >> And commercially obviously it can be measured quite easily with CT scans and with MRIs. Um to my knowledge it's very difficult for DEXA to approximate it. So >> that's right. >> So how how is ultrasound viable? Obviously, you wouldn't be able to get whole body, but you could sample the quads, which is where it would be most that would probably be the canary in the coal mine is if you're accumulating muscle in your quads. >> Yes. And I think it's also very difficult accumulating fat. >> Yeah. Very difficult to test. MRI seems to be where a lot of the data is. We're not there to measure it, but this is something that I think we are going to see so much more of. And you know, it we're all focused on a musclecentric approach. And for the last 50 years, it's been all about obesity. And this is the same thing. It's almost that um we're looking where it's obvious, but it doesn't mean that that's where it's effective. I >> I really agree with you actually. And I think pharmarmacologically, for what it's worth, I think that's the next frontier, right? So I think what the

[02:21:27] GLP1 agonists have done over the past 5 years um with the introduction of the the third and fourth generations of those drugs, the first two were largely failures, but because of how successful the third and fourth generations were, um we're really at a point where I think people can see that you can address the uh crisis of overabundance from a nutrition standpoint, but what people realize the new problem that is yet to be unressed is sarcopenia. And when I'm looking at what's at the leading edge in the frontier of biotech right now, it's all around anti-arcopenia drugs. Now, of course, we have another great drug that works against sarcopenia. Uh it involves holding iron um and eating certain types of foods. Um, but you know, if if if if where billions of dollars are being invested is any indication of what people realize is the next frontier, I think people are waking up to the idea that it's not enough to solve the atapostity problem. You must address the sarcopenic problem. >> Yes, I couldn't agree more. >> What about you, Mike? What have you changed your mind on in the last five years? >> This one I I'm glad you gave me a head start to think about this. You know something? Digestive health. I had a bowel resection done nine months ago.

[02:22:46] So, they took a foot of my colon out and uh and I realized I actually did a really good presentation for our staff called You Don't Know And um it because I think that's the most neglected area of health right now because we don't want to talk about it. And people it's uncomfortable and until you experience it firsthand, you don't realize how important fiber is, how important water is. how badly like most of us are chronic dehydration seems like a oh it's a big deal but it's really not a big deal but it suddenly is a big deal

[02:23:17] I I liken it to it's like you have a dumpster your whole life that's out in the back of your house and it just gets emptied all the time and then suddenly one day you realize they can't empty the dumpster anymore like I'm I'm in trouble and that's us like we we're worried about our muscular system we're worried about our nervous system we're worried about our endocrine system and our digestive system is just this thing that's supposed to be this dependable system that's just going to take care of us forever and then suddenly in our 50s and 60s it starts to fail and we don't want to talk about it and I mean I ended up I was in like I was in the hospital I like I was sick and the guy was like yeah we got to you know this is major surgery we got to take foot of your colon out and put you back together again I won't go into the the real gory specifics but it made me realize that I mean I take a fiber supplement all the time I put fiber you know fiber in my shakes all the time now I look at how much fiber is in everything that I eat now, but you talk about protein numbers.

[02:24:10] Look at the fiber numbers. Our people are way more fiber deficient than protein deficient, but they're not. They're going to suffer the effects way down the road and it'll be too late for them to realize. So, if I would say to anybody, I'd be like, "Drink more water, eat more fiber because uh you don't want a bottle resection." >> All right. What about you, Jeff? >> I'm breaking the rules. have a couple, but you personally I think um I have two twin nine-year-old boys and so in the last 5 years they've gone from four to nine which for a dad is sort of where the the phase where they where mom was definitely the favorite for the first four years and then you know I I sort of step in and become the fun guy. So I've realized through their interactivity with me number one to appreciate things

[02:24:58] I didn't appreciate before. I I think in in the first half of my adult life, I was so focused on professionally achieving whatever I could, whether it be working for the Mets or then starting this business and really going, you know, all hours of the night to try to build a business. Not that I just still don't do that, but I really have learned to better prioritize my time with my kids to the point where it's difficult for me to make travels out out to do podcasts because I really try to be around them and and I've learned to appreciate because of they they're on the spectrum, I've learned to appreciate their their their wins every day, right?

[02:25:32] So, it's like, wow. You know, I I don't take anything for granted. That's a a thing that I am so grateful for that I've been able to benefit from because if I if I don't think if it if the situation was different, I probably would just continue to work work work the way I did. But I think from a professional standpoint, kind of oddly, um one of the things that I think is really overlooked is um uh balance training. And I think that it's an area that people are going to probably have to spend a little bit more time focusing on because it's like like we just talked about digestive health. like it's it's another one of those things that's going to get worse as you get older for a number of reasons. Number one, your reaction times will get worse. Number two, your propriceptive sense is going to get worse, which is essentially your sense of body position. Um, number three, your strength is going to get worse as we talked about inevitably decade by decade. When we consider what all that leads to ultimately falling, we talked about these fears. Um, I don't have the fear of falling right now. I'm sure you don't have the fear of falling right now. We have the Achilles tendon stage right now, but 20 years from now, 30 years from now, our biggest fear should be falling because when you do, you're likely going to live a pretty um uh difficult end of your life and it might lead uh lead to a much faster end of life. And um I think that actually training balance is another one of those things that's going to have to get kind of, you know, sectioned into that five minutes of extra work that you're going to want to have to do for yourself. And the most important thing when you're training your balance, even if it's just simple standing on one leg and drawing an alphabet with your other foot, is to close your eyes. Because I think that when you don't close your eyes, you're actually unid like just one-dimensionally create creating an environment that's not actually what we're going to face. Most people fall in the dark because they don't have that visual feedback to correct. By the time you send that signal down to your ankle to make an adaptation, it's too late. you know, and again, if our if our reaction times are delayed, too, it's going to be even worse. So, it's just a thing that I think people that are already older should start working on because as a skill, you can improve it.

[02:27:33] And as somebody who is, you know, looking down the line here and seeing things change, including my eyesight, which used to be so perfect up close, you know, that that changes. I know all these things are happening under the hood. and uh making a dedicated effort is something I think people should probably um invest some time into cuz it's well worth the investment for that long range safety. >> Yeah. I mean, I think I think the theme here is um I I think we would all agree in the gravitational pull of aging, I just despite the fact of, you know, what what some of the popular biohackers might have you believe, we're not none of us are getting out of this alive. And um I think I I I would bet each of us can remember what it was be like what it was like to be 10 years younger regardless of whatever age we are today.

[02:28:20] But this idea if if I could take what you're all saying and impart one thing to a listener it would be you do have a choice at the rate at which this glider is going to come down. The glider will come down. Gravity always wins. But you can train to reduce the rate of decline. You can train to reduce the rate of decline. It won't happen by accident. Uh the the training you have to do has to be specific, right? It's not obvious or intuitive um that you should do some of these exercises. A lot of the things that you guys have talked about today are exercises. I just love the the front foot um on a plate on a 45 lb plate. putting the front foot up there, going into a um a lunge, taking a plate, and doing little twists. The amount of stress that that puts on the propriceptive capacity of that front foot is insane. What a dumb looking, unsexy exercise that never shows up in the mirror. And yet, what a phenomenal exercise. I'm with you 100% on all of these sorts of balance uh drills with eyes shut. And they're frustrating. It is frustrating to be on one foot with your eyes shut trying and then add the third layer is turn your head when you're doing that. Oh my god. I mean you the the the you know the way you feel and and you don't want to do things you suck at. >> Um but you kind of have to do this and and I I I guess um I don't know. I just hope that people realize that ignoring it won't make it less likely. Um and there is it's a relatively small price to pay. You're not asking people to be in the gym 12 hours a week, right?

[02:30:00] Right. >> Last I checked. >> Yeah. >> Um some of us choose to be in the gym or exercise 12 hours a week, but that's probably because we're weird and we do that just like other people might enjoy watching TV. Um but yeah, if someone could give two great hours a week, um it breaks my heart that pe that that there are people who don't do it for whatever reason, for whatever belief system that says it's too late or it's too hard or I'll do it tomorrow.

[02:30:33] So guys, I really really appreciate this. I don't know where the time went. Um because we didn't actually cover a single thing I had written down. Um which is okay because you know I had good stuff written down but I thought we talked about good stuff. So um I'm incredibly grateful for all of you making the trip out here. Um and uh I only wish we had another 3 hours although we'd have to take another bathroom break or something. So thank you all for coming. >> Thank you. This is a pleasure. Honestly pleasure to get to meet you guys. this guy already knew. But, uh, I could do this all day. >> Thanks, guys. >> Thanks. >> Thank you. [Music]

## Transcript

[00:00:00] We're spending $1 trillion on K through2 education, but our ROI is quite low. Why are we doing so poorly? The standards just keep going down. If you're a B student, you are from 3 years behind to 7 years behind. Where did this virus infect us? >> The best analogies we always use that parents totally understand is sports.

[00:00:19] Everybody in sports is like if you're not doing well, go back and do the basics. You think it's the current material, but it's your prerex, right? It's your foundation. It's so easy to fix. When you use these, you know, learning science-based AI tutors and the apps that we have, kids can learn 10 times faster. >> You would still say that 95% of all eighth graders in the United States >> could be what today is considered top 10% performance. The most important part of education is a motivated student. 2-hour learning is motivational for every kid on the planet. Our competition is Fortnite and Tik Tok and we need to use things like Genai to create such compelling content for kids. They've created a narrative that says I can't do math. Once it becomes this mastery based system, it's a decision, not an inherent capability. And there's this mental view of oh, I guess I am a smart kid. It's like the kindling that leads to the fire. What's the simplest unlock to fix education in America? It would be this. >> Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive

[00:01:21] Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia. [Music] Joe, thank you so much for making time to come over today. It's nice once in a while to have a guest who is local and doesn't have to travel so far. >> No, it's great. I super appreciate it. You know, look, people are probably wondering like, you know, how does this sort of tie into health and medicine and and this is a topic that's a little bit about outside of that, but but really it's not because it's where we're ultimately going to go is education and you can't have a great system of health and medicine if you're not educating um kids today, right? The the people that you know are learning today are going to be the ones taking care of us. Uh so I think everybody should have a vested interest in this in this process. Of course, also many people listening um have kids um across various spectrums of learning. But I think before I get into that, your story is just so interesting and I know you don't really like telling your story because I know this cuz I know you so well and all you want to do is talk about the work, but I'm going to force you to tell your story a little bit. So, where did you grow up? >> So, uh moved around. I was born in

[00:02:24] Minnesota and I moved around every couple years uh and mostly up and down the east coast. Um, my dad worked for General Electric and wherever they had a factory, uh, whatever town we'd we'd moved there. >> You obviously did very well in high school and you wound up at Stanford. So, what what were you what did you what did you major in? >> I majored in econ. Uh, I did not graduate. I dropped out, but I would have been uh uh an econ major. I mostly picked it because it was easy uh in the in the Stanford curriculum. >> So, what year were you in when you dropped out? So, I would have been class of 90, 1990. Um, I would have been uh and I dropped out between junior and senior year. I I was I'm sure my junior year professors were like, he's not really engaged and probably misses too many classes. And, you know, for me and just a little bit on the background was, you know, when I was in high school, I wrote a paper on AI and you know, one of the parts of the the paper was about expert systems and old school AI, not what we know today. And uh there was a part like one paragraph called neural nets which is sort of today's AI and I was like this is decades away. >> And so I then went to Stanford and literally I was in a class with uh professor Vagenbomb who's considered one of the fathers of expert systems and old school AI and he's just talking about how this is you know you can build these incredible systems and they'd be worth you know millions of dollars you know if you could figure it out. And so, you know, a uh some classmates and I, we dropped out, you know, and started uh

[00:03:57] Trilogy. And the story around that was just it was the first AI company, we didn't call it AI back then because it had a bad rep in the '9s to sell a billion dollars of AI products. Um, and so that's how we got our start. Um, and eventually leads to, you know, today's story. >> Yeah. So, so again, you I always find it amazing when people are dropping out like with one year to go, right? It's sort of like why didn't you finish it?

[00:04:22] But you must have a strong conviction if you're saying I'm going to forego my Stanford degree to go and start this company that can't they can't wait a year to do this, right? >> Sure. Well, there's and so back to this story because I I had, you know, my dad there's a famous Forbes uh headline that's like you're a cuz my dad was very clear what a I was being by dropping out. And you know it's the the issue was I felt there was a time to market issue. It was a race, >> right? And I was just like I I'm sitting in Spanish class. I don't care, right?

[00:04:53] And my market's going to run away without me. And there's this huge opportunity to go build this company. And it's just it's that tension where you thought now with 2020 hindsight, it took us over three years to build the product and we thought we could do it much quicker. And so there wasn't a time tomarket issue. with with with hindsight, I could have stayed. Um, but back to that pressure, I just felt it. I didn't want to miss it. I had to go do it. And so that's what actually led to the >> And did you guys come and set up shop in

[00:05:22] Austin right away? >> Yeah. Well, not right away. So, we dropped out and did the whole, you know, we couldn't raise funding. Silicon Valley back in the late ' 80s was not given money to dropouts like us. And uh, but we literally lived in a garage. You know, we had, you know, classmates who had like have a house and we're like, can we rent your garage to live in it?

[00:05:39] Uh but then uh in ' 92 we moved down to Austin. Actually John Lynch who was one of the co-founders was like look you know if we're going to be poor a back then Austin was cheap. It was like it's a lot cheaper than Palo Alto so let's go move down there. And so that's actually what led us led us down here uh to

[00:05:58] Austin. When did this idea of finding your next you know I guess is it uh is it David Brooks who wrote that book the second mountain? Right. So if your if your first mountain was was Trilogy, this incredible business, which really we're not going to say much more about other than the fact that it basically created an an unlimited essentially war chest of capital that you were then able to go and deploy to your second mountain, which is this passion around education.

[00:06:27] Yes, you always had an interest in AI, but when did these two become the next frontier >> come together? So uh back to education. So, uh, 10 years ago, 11 years ago now, uh, McKenzie Price started Alpha in Austin. And, you know, it's this still radical idea back then, you know, and one of the things I've learned as principal of Alpha is that parents want their kids' education to be however they were educated. And I was the same way. I went to Catholic school. My kids are in

[00:07:00] Catholic school, you know, and Mackenzie's like, "Look, look at this great new school I got. It's gonna be awesome, you know. And I was like, Mackenzie, I'm that's weird. Like at when she started, it's literally in some guy's garage. I'm like, you know, her co-founder. And I'm like, I'm not going to the weird school. Sorry. And it took her two years to actually convince me to move my daughters over. And you know, they sampled it one time and literally loved it, you know, and they came back and said it was they did it after their

[00:07:33] Catholic school got out before they went to summer camp. And they came back and they're like, "Dad, we don't want to go to summer camp. We want to still go to alpha." And I didn't like school enough to want to. >> Yeah. >> You weren't going to miss summer for school. >> That sounded crazy to me. So anyway, I was like, "Okay, that's actually a really good sign. We should move over."

[00:07:48] And that was 10 years ago. than how I but my discussions with Mackenzie always was like this is awesome but it's not scalable >> and and and yeah just what did alpha look like 11 years ago when you first peered behind the curtain >> the other co-founder Brian right and he had this philosophy he had these rules like when so when I sent move my kid over to Alpha I said Brian what are the two things I don't believe about education that I need to understand he's like first kids must love school they must love school and I'm like sort of spinach sometimes, dude. Like, no, I I

[00:08:23] He's like, "You're wrong and you'll figure it out." And I was like, "Okay." And then his second is your kids can do so much more than you expect. And I'm like, "Oh, I'm I sort of have really high expectations." He's like, "They're going to blow you away on what they can do, and your expectations are too low."

[00:08:42] And so, you know, he was, you know, uh, setting it up. It really, it was 20 kids, right? They weren't in a garage after two years but you know it is alternative they would use a set of apps right to do academics but you know they'd have you know the teachers right would help academically if needed um and then they would have all these life skills they check charts um and life skills so it was some academics and then workshops and life skills and that was you know 10 years >> and the 20 kids that are in there are what grade slash age range. >> Yeah, they're going to be from uh they're probably second grade to fifth grade was probably the range. Sixth grade, somewhere around there. And you know, and they're clustered sort of like the one room schoolhouse, right? And you know, you go in and it is crazy. Like he's like, "Oh, they're doing spelling bees." I'm like, "They're walking on their hands, you know, they're doing handstands across the room." And he's like, "Yeah, watch how they do And literally they would, you know, have to buy try they'd try to walk across the room in handstands but recite all the words on their spelling v is doing it right and could they make it all across and the kids were just having a ton of fun right and uh I was always like are they really learning and sort of all the academic side but you know testing showed they were. >> And what was the state of technology?

[00:10:07] What what you you referred to some apps, but what what was the state of educational apps 11 years ago? >> Yeah, they were um there was things like Dreambox and uh Khan Academy was out and so they were static. I mean static in the sense that um um they weren't adaptive I guess is maybe >> they weren't or they're the problem with old ones and actually even a bunch of them today is you know now we know with learning science you know all these much better ways to do it. Their standards of mastery were too low. um uh their their implementation of learning science was too little, you know, if if you look at them, but they were good enough that you could, you know, get your way through.

[00:10:47] But back to some of the problems, like when my oldest, you know, first took her seventh grade test, um you know, standardized test, she failed it all, you know, and so >> sorry, this is after being in the alpha program. >> This was she had been in the alpha program. Yep. and with with those apps. Got it. And so the apps were, you know, janky and not all there. Um this is before I got involved uh except as a parent and you know she failed her seventh grade you know test and standardized test state standardized test and you're like oh wow >> so something there was a mismatch >> and there's mismatch they just you know you can use apps you know and people say how does alpha get all these results because there's a lot of people who try to use these apps and you're like these apps have gaps and holes and you know figuring out how to change that was a lot of what how I got involved and you know what I've been doing the last three years So your foray into this is obviously then in this logical way through the experience of your own kids.

[00:11:46] I want to just take a step way back and talk more about education in general. So I I I don't think anybody listening to us now is unfamiliar with the idea. Uh although this is it's not particularly popular at the moment. We have enough other things that are going on in the world that have people up in arms, but it's it's sort of cyclic when people sort of look at the data and realize that the United States is not doing well in uh primary and secondary education.

[00:12:15] Um or I don't know if those are the right terms, but whatever it is up to K to 12, whatever. I don't know if secondary is considered college, but we we start to do pretty well in college, right? Uh relative to the world, but but getting to college, we're not doing well. And it's it's it's this is further um I think the the point is is further made when you look at the dollars in to results out. So I I think we're spending what $1 billion pardon me $1 trillion on

[00:12:44] K- through2 education which is about 17th of what the world spends and of course we don't have 17th of the population. So there's a huge mismatch there. Um but our ROI is quite low. So it's it's actually kind of parallels the healthcare spending thing right where we on a per capita basis we spend more on healthcare than anybody else and yet we're actually not producing the best life expectancy. So, let's dwell on that for a moment. Why does the United States spend so much money on K through2 education? Um, and maybe more importantly, why are we not getting the results, at least if we believe we're measuring the results correctly? If the results are to be determined by these tests that all the

[00:13:25] OECD nations take, yeah, >> why are we doing so poorly? >> That's a really complex answer, but there's there's a set of them, which it is it is true, right? our academic performance continues to go down uh across it. As an example, there's this test uh NWA MAP test. It's a nationwide test. You know, when I was a kid, I took an Iowa test. This is equivalent one. You know, millions of kids take it and they just updated their 2025 norm table. You know, the last one they did is is 2020. um you know every 5 years they update the benchmark and

[00:14:01] America knows less now. So your average eighth grader in 2025 knows less than the average eighth grader in 2020 who knows less than 2015. So >> you can't just blame co on that like this is a continuing trend. >> It's it's a continuing trend. It's continuing to go down. There is one actually anomaly which is uh in both the 20 when from 15 to 20 and 20 to 25 there's one one group who actually goes up and that's your 99th percentile. So the top 1% academically in America in K through 12 continues to increase. Right?

[00:14:36] Those are your IV league bound kids continue to go up. Um uh now but everybody else is is um uh going down. Things are getting easier in tests. You know the the AP tests in high school that you take. you know, they reormed them in the last couple years and they normally against college kids because it's like, okay, if you take an AP test, that's like a college class, >> right? And so they say, well, what do college kids know? And they're like, oh, college kids know less. So now our AP test is easier, >> right? And so it used to be at alpha, if you were going to be in the honors track, you had to get a four or five on an AP. Now we're like, oh, you just need a five because the fours are too easy, right? Just the the standards just keep going down. And you know, I'll give some more data just, you know, I just gave the academic talk. Um, we had hundreds of families at Alpha across the country.

[00:15:31] We have campuses now everywhere. And, you know, start the last couple weeks. And so they all come in, they take a placement test, you know, and I got up in front of all the parents and I was like, "Here's the message, and it's going to worry you, but you should take away that you're, you know, $40,000 private school, they've been lying to you, which is if your student has an A and you've been getting straight A's on your transcript, that student in our tests, right, is anywhere from one year ahead, that's great, to three years behind.

[00:16:07] This is an A student who's three years behind. And when we talk about three years behind, if they're a seventh grader, that means they're missing a significant number of questions on the fourth grade test. If you're a B student, you are from three years behind to seven years behind. So, you've been paying your price. >> Let's let's give an example of what this means. I I have a great sense of this because, you know, you and I have been through this together, but I want the I want the listener to understand tangibly what that means. Let's put that in terms of something mathematical. >> So let's talk about what that implies for a B student in seventh grade mathematics. What concept could they be possibly missing? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Well, I they don't know their multiplication tables or division tables. So, one of the things that's happened in sort of K through2 education is they've decided that memorization is bad and that memorizing you don't need to memorize your multiplication tables anymore. You're just going to use a calculator. You know, that's not what learning science says. That is not you.

[00:17:12] If you're going to do higher level math, you need fact fluency. And if you think of cognitive load theory, right, you have a certain number of working memory slots. And the level of complexity of the math problem that you can solve is going to be based on how many slots you have and right how you're using them.

[00:17:28] And you know one of the few places in in in brain chemistry is if you uh have memorized something to fluency it doesn't use a slot. It doesn't use it. And so you can do higher level math, but if you have to use your slots to say 7* 8 is 56, you're now trying to do higher level math and you're using it up on the wrong things. So you if you want to do higher level math, memorize your math tables, right? And your division tables to fluency. And that that's like the most simple obvious thing we could do in this country is just change that, right?

[00:18:03] Just go back to what we used to do. And you're like scores keep going down. And you know if you even get in and even this and this is like the most extreme example is you know we had a student who had a 740 math SAT. >> So again just for listeners who might not be familiar with that the score is 800. So 7 740 would be a very good score. >> What percentile is that? >> Uh I'd have top 10%. >> Okay. Yeah. 90th percentile easily. >> 770 is like a top 1%. So maybe in top 5%

[00:18:30] I'd have to um and uh so great score. >> Yep. She cannot get above it. And when we we we do game what we call game film, right? You review why you missed the test, why you missed the questions on the test, right? One thing as an example that's common in sports, right? Game film. >> People don't do this in academics for some reason. So they she would just go through it and she's like, I know what that is. You you decide was it a careless error? >> Yep. >> Did you not know the material? Yep. >> She's like after the test she could get them all done right given time. And what happened was is she was overloaded and made careless mistakes. When you're right, working memory slots are overloaded. It reflects actually in careless mistakes. So if your students making careless mistakes, you're like grit and discipline. You're like, you probably don't have a fact fluency somewhere earlier that if you just go fix that, all of a sudden those careless mistakes go away. So she literally went back to third grade, learned her multiplication and division tables, right? And back to convincing parents, that's really hard convincing students and parents to your 740 math student needs third grade material.

[00:19:40] She then got a 790 math after she memorized it because she stopped making the careless errors. She knew all the material before she was overloading her working memory, right? And the learning science is like that's that's her issue. And in our system, we can identify that and fix it. and seemingly crazy, you know, that you can go back and and memorize your tables and get up there. >> And I remember another story, Joe, that we kind of bonded over a couple of years ago, which was the the student that was really struggling in uh in entry level chemistry. >> Yeah. >> And

[00:20:19] I mean, I can I I think anybody who's been through chemistry can empathize with that. first time you're doing you're going through physical chemistry and you're trying to balance the chemical equations and and this this kid is dying and they think the problem is I'll never it's chemistry the problem is chemistry and you came in and said no actually the problem is fractions you didn't master fractions in third grade or fourth grade or whenever fractions are introduced and you're failing chemistry because you did you for this exact reason we're going to go back and fill the gap in chemist in in fractions and this will become easy for you and of course that's what happened >> and math science knowledge is hierarchical right and this is back to mastery which is we've why we do poorly we've given up mastery in this country >> why >> um we're a timebased system right at the end of third grade you're moving to fourth grade and at the end of fourth grade you're moving to fifth grade and we don't hold kids back we don't we just we've said we're just going to move kids through no matter what Um cuz it's time cuz there's all these other social issues, right? And you know, oh my god,

[00:21:28] I can't have my kid hold back the pressure on the school to relax the standards. You know, >> 80% of kids at Harvard get an A now. You know, it's just grade inflation. You know, grades >> look like this. Yep. >> Standardized test scores look like that, right? And it's just we've just got and for whatever reasons we've done it but in a timebased system you know and here's part just even grading you know there's this concept that you know okay you got a 70 you know you can pass an 80 is a B right that's great okay my kids would be student 80 the problem is you know if you only have 80% you know knowledge you're creating all these holes and it all compounds where eventually and it starts to when you hit algebra or chemistry right that you're you think it's the current material material, but it's your prerex, right?

[00:22:15] It's your foundation. And you know, we talk a lot about parents because a lot of this is, you know, >> we all grew up in this timebased system and just the old system. And so this new way is very different, but the best analogies we always use that parents totally understand is sports, right? Just like game film. We're like, review your tests, figure out what's wrong.

[00:22:33] Mastery is the same one, you know, which is if you're the point guard and you lose the ball 20% of the time going down the court, the coach isn't like, "Let's work on the advanced stuff." They're like, "Kid, let's learn how to dribble." >> We don't need to worry about dunking yet. >> Correct. No dunking. Like, let's focus on right get up to 99%. Get to mastery that you know how to do the basics.

[00:22:54] Everybody in sports is like, "If you're not doing well, go back and do the basics." Well, academics is the same way. And if you apply that same logic, right, but in a timebased system with a teacher in front of a classroom, right, you can't get every kid to mastery, right? And that's when we get into like the new solutions and and why we get these crazy, you know, kids can learn 10 times faster. It's because we're able to get out of a non-mastery, non-timebased system or a non-mastery timebased system that has a teacher in front of a classroom.

[00:23:28] Right? Teachers are great. teacher in front of the classroom's bad. Um, you know, that that dynamic. And so, uh, but and to your point, hierarchical, you know, chemistry is just algebra with advanced word problems, right? Physics is literally calculus with advanced word problems. >> You know, algebra is basically advanced fraction manipulation. You can give kids a fraction test and predict their algebra score, right? And then fractions are how's your division and multiplication tables? Do you memorize them to fluency? And so it just keeps going down the whole track, you know, all the way down. And so part of what you have to do to fix the system, right, is figure out age grade. Oh, wait. I'm an eighth grader in algebra and knowledge grade. Wait, I don't know. My fractions are different. And so, you know what? A teacher in the front of a classroom, though, it's not their fault, right? I'm a teacher. I'm an eighth grade teacher.

[00:24:22] What do you teach? Eighth grade material. Yeah. and I have kids who don't who who don't who who don't know some third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh material. What do I do? Right? And this is why, you know, and um so many people hire tutors, you know, after school at private schools, right? There's, you know, it's crazy. We have all these people go to private schools and hire after school tutors because the school doesn't teach them. And you know, the tutors just like, "Okay, I'm going to go give you the earlier grade level material. That's it." Um, when we talk about kids, all these hundreds of kids coming in who are, you know, 3 years behind, seven years behind, the second part of what I tell the parents is that's freaking you out cuz nobody wants their kid this far behind, but it's so easy to fix. The remediation on this stuff is no time at all. That when you use these, you know, learning science-based AI tutors and the apps that we have, kids can learn 10 times faster. 10 times faster. So when you actually look at material there's 180 school days right hour a day plus homework so couple hundred hours most of grade one subject right per grade level takes our alpha kids between 20 and 30 hours to finish an entire grade level to mastery.

[00:25:40] So you can take fourth grade math and be like, you got 26 hours, kid. You do an hour a day of homework. You're 26 days away, right? 22 hours is seventh grade and sixth grade. 22 each, right? For math. And Joe, would this work if, and again, as just as a thought experiment, if each student had one teacher, the private tutor? Yeah. If you could put a private tutor in front of a student for 22 hours over the course of, you know, whatever two months or one hour a day for 26 days, >> are you confident that that individual, and of course, we'll talk about why that's not practical, but that that individual, if skilled enough, could navigate and weave that child through. if you give me a few more hours than what I just gave you because the AI can do a little bit better than than than most tutors. But yes, fundamentally the paper that was written when I was in high school about education like so learning science and we didn't you know learning science has been around for 40 years they've been writing papers there's 10,000 papers published by all the schools of education and you know

[00:26:44] Stanford and you know all over the place that is we know kids can learn two five or 10 times faster right we've known it in you know blues two sig Bloom's two sigma is a seminal paper and he just said if everybody got a personalized tutor was his First point and second they did it to mastery. They worked to mastery. >> Right? So mastery based not tenure based. >> Correct. Just you have to know the material before you advance and there's an individual tutor to coach you. You will get two sigma better performance which is right your leftmost part of your curve. Your worst students are going to be at what today is considered the top 10%. >> And two sigma performance. You said to me once four or five years ago something and I'm curious if you still stand by it, which is at least through the end of 8th grade, there is not a single student in the United States that cannot achieve complete mastery in mathematics to score above the 90th or 99th percentile in the national test. >> Yes. So, and I think I said that to you three years ago and I would hesitate I just for argument sake take out the bottom 5% just to >> stop all the arguments. >> Okay. All right. So 95 you would still say that 95% of all eighth graders in the United States >> could be what today is considered top 10% performance. They can get to master >> in mathematics. >> In mathematics. >> Yeah. So just let that settle in for a moment. Right. like that just that seems to fly in the face of everything. I want to go back and close the loop on something before we continue this discussion which is I still don't have a sense of what's changing right because we've always had a timebased system not a mastery based system. So what has gone on in the last 25 years because that's not the change. What is why are why why are scores >> why are standards well the fundamental answer is standards are lowering and part of it is parents right here's so

[00:28:45] I'll I'll give you you know three years ago when I became principal you know I would sit down with parents and I'm like we have this cool engine it's going to teach your kid twice as much in the 2-hour block twice as much now they have to use the apps right and engage with it and you know your your students not using it right, so they're not learning 2x. The parents are like, "Yo, you stop.

[00:29:10] Don't pressure my kid to learn 2x. Don't pressure them." You know, I'd be in a parent meeting. It would literally be, you know, mom, dad, and Johnny. And I'm like, look, when, you know, when he misses a question, he doesn't watch the video, right? Or he's scrolling and just guessing. If he just watched the video, he'd learn twice as much. And the parents would say, "We're not interested in that." Now, >> so why are they >> hundreds of hundreds? Well, um the rest of the things parents want life skills, community, a school is a bundle >> of which academics is one piece. >> And for the most part in America, except for less fewer than 10% like less than 10% market share, less than 10% of the parents, right? Fewer than 10% of parents really care about academics. that 90% of parents are like, "Oh, well." Um, and so that was an eye openener to me. And hundreds of parents of meetings later, I literally we switched our pitch, which was 2-hour learning, the same engine cuz he just flipped the You're like, "It's two-hour learning." And look, we're trying to get Johnny out of here in two hours so he can do these cool workshops and do what he loves, >> right? And that flip. Parents are like, then all of a sudden they're like, "Johnny, what's wrong with you? Why aren't don't you want to get out of here and do the cool stuff? And so it's it's back to you know the most important part of education is a motivated student and you know for us 2x learning is not a motivating idea except for you know sort of the top kids but 2-hour learning is motivational for every kid on the planet right and that's if you had to say our my biggest unlock was that realization and you know the product became codeename time back give the kids their time back because that is the most precious right that for 12 years we waste kids time. We know that kids sitting in a lecture-based classroom right retain maybe 5%. >> It's that bad. It's that bad. And so like being 10 times better, you're like

[00:31:16] I need them to remember 50%. Right? I just I there's still, you know, it's it's that bad. We know it's that bad, right? It's not personalized to them. It's not to a mastery. All these bad things. Um, and so we're wasting their 12 years. And you wonder why kids don't like academics and they're not disengaged and all these things is we're wasting their time. And so for this it's like great just they're going to learn two in two hours. Now they're still learning 2x, right? That's just not the part we pitch. And so they're learning 2x in two hours. And then you free up the rest of the day. And so we get all our kids, right? Our score is at alpha school. We're all top 1%. Right?

[00:31:52] Academically our our classes are top 1% in the country. There's no school academically who's as good as alpha um you know in the country and the reason is is using this model right and we've we're just implementing all these concepts that have been written in these learning science papers for 40 years. >> Is there is there a challenge to the intensity that's required in those two hours? So I'll give you an analogy. So,

[00:32:16] I get asked all the time, uh, hey Peter, look, I've read that, you know, I could just do one set to failure once a week for each body part and get most of the benefits of, you know, grinding it out for, you know, 10 to 20 sets per body part. And I say, look, well, that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but there's some truth to this, right? Like, if you could truly do one to two sets to absolute failure u per exercise, yeah, you're going to get great results. And they're like, well, Peter, why don't you do that? And I and I say, "Look, to be honest with you, it's really freaking hard to bring that level of intensity to every single set of every single workout, every time you do it." Um, and there are a bunch of other reasons that

[00:32:56] I actually kind of like being in the gym or whatever. But, but the point is, um, it's true you can get great results in much less time, but for many people, the intensity is not something they're willing to rise to. And and so I guess the similar question is if for two hours a day a kid can learn what a traditional kid is learning in six to seven hours a day and actually do it better. Um is there something that they have to be able to bring from an attention span perspective that is very difficult or not something that is you know Yeah. >> Yeah. And so the answer is it's not difficult but they have to want to do it. So motivation. So if you know if you talk to an educator, there's two things you need. You need a motivated student and you need to put them in lessons of the correct difficulty. Not too easy, not too hard, >> right? That's back to and edte and why, you know, taking this a little bit. Why doesn't edte work, >> right? Back to these apps and you know, test scores keep going down, but everybody keeps buying edtech. And the answer is edtech does that second piece, that 10% piece of put them in the right, you know, lessons very well. Our AI tutors do it even better. It can figure out very easily what a kid knows and doesn't know and say age grade, eighth grade, knowledge grade, fourth, give them fourth grade lessons, right? And so that part's great. Now the second part is to the point of my parent meeting.

[00:34:19] How do I get them to engage with the app? Right? Because I'm spinning in the chair. I'm not paying attention. I'm talking to my friend. I'm scrolling Tik Tok. Right? I'm doing anything except focusing on it. And so what is there? Motivation is 90% of the solution. And for us, that's why time back is so valuable, which is the kid has to engage with the apps for those two hours or they don't get the rest of the day. They don't get their time back, right?

[00:34:47] They'll just sit there wasting their time. I mean, we literally in our app have a waste meter and it just coaches the kid, right? The AI like we can get into the AIS and stuff and chat chat bots are terrible. like chat GBT rolled out to America students they 90% of kids use it as a cheat bot it's all cheating that we don't have a chat interface in ours but one of the things our AI does is it watches the kids screen and coaches them up and it's like look you're scrolling the article and guessing not going to learn that way right you're skipping this right and it's going to coach them of how to learn better and if you have a motivation for the student to actually learn better and be effective. They're very happy to do that, right? We have a sports academy that we just we just opened 10 10 of them around Texas and these are middle schools, right? D1 bound athletes, you know, kind of and they come in and they do the two hours in the apps, right? And then once they hit it, you know, and they go green where they've done the lessons, right, they get to do sports all afternoon. And so you can take kids who are like,"I hate school. I skip school. You know, absenteeism is huge."

[00:35:59] And when they get to do that, all of a sudden they're like, "I'm totally motivated." Right? We It's only been a couple weeks that we've been open. But you get notes from all the parents who are like, "My kid always was sick, never wanted to go, everything. Now he's waking me up and is like, let's not be late." Right? And it's because they have the motivation to actually learn. And so now, now you so that's the most important. You can do that for everybody, right? And motivation really really does matter and alpha is designed around how do we motivate kids and the biggest motivators time back. We also use a lot of other ones. Um but that's that's the biggest thing that makes our system work and when then when you talk just is there also extra juice of the intensity >> right we measure do kids get through our apps 90 or 95% first time right >> right where we're not making the lesson hard where we want to make sure the lesson's not too hard where you don't have to have too much intensity. Yep. >> Right. Now we also have a >> What is the sweet spot? Is it 90% >> between 90 and 95% is where first time right? Yeah. So actually a little bit there's a thing called the zone of proximal development which is what an individual student should be in. You want to keep a student in 80 to 85% correct questions which is different than first time right on getting through the whole lesson. You want to be in the zone of proximal development which is you know if you're at 99% it's too easy.

[00:37:24] You're not learning right. If you're getting 99% of the questions right, uh, you're just regurgitating what you already know. If you're missing and half the time or twothirds, you know, you're only at 50 or 60, right? You get disengagement, right? It's too frustrating. Like, I'm out, right? We literally video game developers are the world's experts on this on engagement of how do you engage? And, you know, they'll tell you, you know, always winning, always learning, you know, and that concept. And 80 to 85% is is where that is. So we're measuring you know the way to maximize learning is a unending stream of content right both educational questions right and learning content that is at 80 to 85% accuracy um you know and and this gets into stuff that we're we're building is you know if you sit in a Stanford lecture you're going to retain one to five facts ideas and concepts per hour. our current learning engines depending on what the subject we're at 20 to 40 you know we have stuff that we're working on where when and Gen AI is the driver of this we'll get to a 100 facts ideas and concepts an hour right think of an endlessly scrolled Tik Tok list except engaging and good content instead of the the poison that that is and so the learning science part is we know how to get knowledge into kids' head 10 times better than the current educational system, but it it takes a whole rebuild and back to kids when they love school, they're going to engage in the app because the whole day is great. >> So, let's go back and talk a little bit about education science, right? You've alluded to it a couple of times. >> Um, tell me what is what 90% of people would agree with.

[00:39:14] Right. There's nothing that I was going to say tell me something that is unambiguously true about education science, but but let's let's soften that a little bit and say tell me something that 90% of people who study education, study the science of learning would agree with. >> 90% would agree that individualized tutoring and a mastery based standard is the best way to teach kids, right? It's it's dramatically more effective than a timebased system. um that the concepts in learning science, zone of proximal development, uh spaced repetition, right? Um you would get uh the testing effect, right?

[00:39:57] That actually asking kids active learning is better than passive learning, right? That retention of sitting passively in a classroom is the worst way to teach a kid. >> Um they're going to all of those things. Um what else are really well-normed you know cognitive load theory um is a newer area of learning science that's you know sort of developed in started in the '90s and this is the how many working memory slots do you have and then how many reps does it take to move from working memory slot you know short-term memory basically working memory slot to long-term uh they're all going to agree >> by the way it's so interesting to me that this is that there's any dispute around that when you see the effects in sports like the sports illustrates that

[00:40:40] I think more than anything else. Um, you look at the difference between like a Tom Brady versus an exceptional quarterback who's a very good quarterback. And it's the it's the processing speed, right? It's not I mean, it's not how fast or how far he can throw the ball. It's his processing speed that sets him apart. It's it's the cognitive bandwidth of what he's doing.

[00:41:06] And it's this this is I mean it's actually the same in in Formula 1, right? If you look at what separates the very best in the world from very good, it's it's cognitive bandwidth. It's the guy who actually doesn't have to think at all about driving. >> Mhm. >> And can still drive at the limit while he can use all of his cognitive reserve for strategic decision-m and and overtaking something like that. And so like that fluency stuff just there's no there's nobody in learning science who's like >> it's better if they don't memorize their multiplication tables even though >> our school system you know has abandoned that and that's that's you know p private it's not like oh these private schools are you know the private schools are bailing on it too it's not just >> but why was that decision made >> um back pressure from you know there's >> that's parental pressure again >> my kid is not happy like one one of the so I there's three things I tell >> so this is another one of the sort of codd of the you know this is just >> and there's three to come to an alpha school now I have a conversation with parents I've sort of fried you know when he gave you those two things but I've add a third a third one to it which is you know first your kid must love school right really love school and we measure literally measure would you rather go to school or go on vacation like super high standard right we should have kids love school for 12 years right and they're going to be there your childhood why why do we not have that standard The second is your kid can learn in two hours, right? Twice as much as sitting in class for six, right? You your kid can crush academics in just two hours a day. Crush it. That's the second thing you have to believe to come to Alpha. And the third, and this is where the controversy parts, but it's true, you know, is the key to your kids happiness is high standards, right? And that's the one that a lot of people do not believe that they think the key to my kid's happiness is low standards. And the problem with low standards I can't virus come from where where did where did this virus infect us? >> Well part of it is if you actually you know the parents want to protect their kids right it comes from parents from a a good place which is I don't want to see my kids struggle and fail on their road to success. They don't want to see that. Like I I talk about, you know, the cycle >> as a as a principal, I can tell you kids struggle, fail, sometimes cry on their road to success if they're supported by a caring, loving adult. Right? That loop, if you ask any child development expert in the planet, right? You can type that all in chatbt is the key to kids development, the key to their self-confidence, the key to their resilience, right? The key to their growth that they go through the cycle of struggle, fail, right? on the road. >> It's a hero's journey. >> It's a hero's journey. >> It's it's woven into everything. >> And back to your point on sports. >> Everybody, why do you 50% of America's like, you know, where my kid learns life skills? And when you talk about life skills, teamwork, leadership, grit, hard work, >> it's in after school sports >> because that's what the coach does. >> My kids's going to go through that struggle and I went through it when I was playing sports and my kids going to go through that and that's where you learn it. And they have this view of that's the only place you learn. in school. That's such an interesting point. >> And and the reason it doesn't happen in schools is because in a timebased system, >> everybody thinks good grades equals high

[00:44:30] IQ. And so it's fundamentally that IQ is what determines grades. And so I don't want to pressure my kid cuz who knows if he's really this, right? It's not fair, right? And so I don't want to put that pressure on them. You know, one of the magic unlocks we have, right? back to everybody can get to you know that much higher performance >> right is a masterybased system you know if you take the best kids you know and you you're like who are the kids who do get in the Ivy League right they're basically the high IQ kids who also have high conscientiousness big five conscientiousness right they're grinders right they just right they just crank through it naturally um and those are the kids who do well and so if we're rebuilding education to fix We have to take those two constraints away, right?

[00:45:20] And so a mastery based system takes away IQ, which is every kid, you know, just the conceptual leaps that are required to get through K through 8. Actually, by the design of Common Core just aren't that big. That does not mean everybody can go be a nuclear physicist at Stanford and design all these things, right? I'm not going to that's that's there is areas where you do need more cognitive everybody in math there's a a point they reach y >> just I can't I can't do the processing but I'm K through eight it's designed that everybody can do it everyone will do it >> everybody can do it so if you and yet just reflect on that for a moment Joe think of all the kids that are in sixth seventh and eighth grade who are good students in other domains they're doing well in English they're doing well in history they're conscientious just they work hard but they they've created a narrative that says I can't do math >> and let I'll we'll dive into that and we'll get into the the second thing of how we we also use our motivation model to undo the conscientiousness limitation. You you have to use more extrinsic motivators to let people who aren't high conscientiousness still perform like somebody who does. So those are our sort of magic unlocks on those two things that we think can fix education. But your math thing, I got I got to give these examples. So, you know, it's an epidemic of kids who come into middle school, you know, predominantly girls. I have two daughters, right? Who come in and they're like, I'm not a math science girl. And there's just like society's like accepting it. Like that. And okay, let's go read all the learning science papers about how middle school girls can't do math science. Okay, there are none. >> There's none. That doesn't exist, right?

[00:47:04] There's no such thing. But it's this total meme that they they believe. >> And so part of what our job in middle or when they transfer in high school is to fix that, >> right? That there's this concept of oh, I'm an art girl or I'm an English girl or whatever it is. And it doesn't girl boy. There's just there's no difference.

[00:47:20] And so like our we have uh some seniors uh this year, you know, the first one uh she's uh her big project that she does at Alpha Alpha, you do these big Alpha X projects. She is doing the first all teen uh produced created musical for Broadway, right? She sourced all the song and songwriters off uh Tik Tok. She can fill a thousand person venue. You know, she's trying to raise it up so she can do it. So, she'd be, you know, I'm an arts theater girl, right? 790 math

[00:47:55] SAT. We have another girl, right? These are seniors. She's, you know, uh, trying out to be Miss Teen USA, right? 790 math SAT, right? Third girl who is doing a, this is my daughter, right? She has a, you know, uh, I call her Tik Tok girl, you know, she's got millions of likes on Tik Tok and tons of followers. She's building a, uh, app to teach teen boys how to ask girls out on dates cuz teen boys are terrible at that. Um, right.

[00:48:27] Top 1% as team math, right? that there's this concept that these people can't learn it. You're like, they all can, right? There's just no. Now, what do you have to do when they come into middle school? They do. They don't know the multiplication tables, right? They don't know the prerexs. They are going to struggle in algebra, right? And so, you're like, okay, let's go back. Let's fill them up. And all of a sudden, once you fill the holes, all of a sudden, they can do it. And then once you know algebra, right, you're like, oh, I can do chemistry, right? and I can move from, you know, because you K through eight science, there's no math actually.

[00:49:01] It's all just memorizing facts, you know, ignous rocks and, you know, the planets and stuff. Um, once you get to high school, that's where, you know, biology is still more memorization, less math. But then chemistry and physics are all math-based, calculus and and algebra. And so, you have to get these kids the prerexs, but then all of a sudden they're like, "Oh, chemistry is pretty fun, right? Oh, I now that I know calculus and I can crush calc BC." all our kids in high school, right? If you want to be on the honors track, it's five on CalPC, right? And totally doable, right, for everybody. And so this whole thing, you know, our freshman coming in by the end of the freshman year, they're 1410 on the SAT, right?

[00:49:41] Which, you know, 1350 is top 10%. Right? I mean, these are freshmen. >> These are freshmen. Like, and most schools don't I mean, that's better than most junior seniors. Most don't publish their freshman results, right? and uh and we can get freshmen there, you know, and you and and once it becomes this mastery based system, how high you go becomes a decision back to your effort.

[00:50:03] It's a decision, not an inherent capability. And so when you break that link, like alpha kids are just like in a mastery based system, they're like, "Oh, it's just more work. It's not I'm not smart enough." Right? And that is the unlock that we have to have and why we have to move to a mastery based system because you just need kids to be like, oh, so if you want to be in the non-honor, if you're in normal alpha high, right, 1350 is the minimum SAT, right? You got to get to it. Top 10%. If you want to be in the honors track, it's 1550. And we're just like >> 1550. I mean, that's top 1%. >> Yeah. Oh, yeah. And but it's it's just a decision. Do you want to do the work to get to 1550, right? From 1350, right?

[00:50:46] And so this >> so it's just that look, I'm willing to put in this many more hours this year. >> Yeah. No. Uh so back to my uh uh my youngest daughter who's just took the SAT and you know uh it's she's top 1% but she's not perfect 800 and she's like she literally was in she's asking the AI she's like how much time will it take for me to get up to the top to a perfect 800? And you know, at that level, it doesn't really matter for getting into college. But she's like, >> just out of curiosity, >> she's like, well, no, she's like, you know, dad, you know, all those STEM boys, you know, they think I'm this dumb

[00:51:25] Tik Tok girl, and you know, if I get an 800, I get to mog on them the rest of their life, and I think it's totally worth it. And so, she's literally, but it's just a decision. She's trying to decide. It'll come back and it'll probably be 20-ish hours, probably. I don't know, some some manageable number of hours. And she'll just be making a decision. Am I going to put the reps in, right, the practice in to get there, right, so that I can have this ego boost basically because she really loves it or no? Okay, you know, I'm going to do something else with my time. But that's where, you know, in these mastery based models, you know, versus, you know, in a teacher in front of a classroom model where you're a timebased system, you're like, I don't know how to get there, >> right? There's no path up. And you know when we when you log in to our system, it literally tells you, you know, in two hours a day, you know, you're three years behind. So you first come in, you're like, you're three years behind.

[00:52:16] It's you're like, "Oh my god, that seems insurmountable." You're 20 to 30 hours per grade level. So you could be 60 hours behind. If you're three years behind, 60 hours, that's it. You're 60 hours away. And you're like, "So if I do an hour of homework and two months, I'm there. >> I'm caught up." >> Yeah. >> I'm caught up.

[00:52:35] And now back to incentives, there's some kids who are like, do I care that I'm caught up? But it's easy to incentive to want to catch up, right? And you can figure out, okay, what do we have to do? You know, one of the things we one of the things Alpha is known for, whether infamously or not, is we use extrinsic motivators, right, to drive Yeah. We use money. Time back is the most important one. it's more important than money is, you know, sort of the, you know, the

[00:53:03] Westlake track where you got to do, you know, honors track where it's, you know, six hours a day and eight zillion homework hours. I don't think you can pay a kid enough to like love school by going through that versus, you know, we're two hour actually, and just be clear, we're two hours a day for a non-honors track. We're three hours a day for honors back to the 1550. It does take more time. Um, but we will take middle school kids, like this is this is a middle school active program. We have kids come in and we will pay them $1,000 to get to top 1%.

[00:53:35] And you know, I there's a lot of stories, right, around this where kids view, look, I can't do that. It's not I'm not the smart kid. I'm not the math science girl. I can't whatever it is. And well, if you get there and do these lessons and we're just going to keep giving you lessons and you do the work, you're going to get $1,000. you know, you're the we'll pay kids, right, coming in middle school $1,000 um to get to top 1%. And the point of this is, you know, what's even more important than the academic knowledge, it's their internal view of themselves that changes that kids come in and say,

[00:54:13] I'm not a math science girl. I can't be top 1%. I can't do this. Whatever limits they have. And a lot of education when you talk about it is, you know, holistically you're trying to take limits in kids and release them, right? And have them understand you're limitless. You can do all this. And this is the best way academically we found to do it. And so they come in and the AI is going to say, "Here's all the lessons you need to do to get to top 1%." And just go through them. And that motivation will get all these kids to top 1%. And the number of stories we have, you know, I have one of my own daughter, but all, you know, the alpha families where their student is like they come back and they're like, I didn't realize I could be top 1% and my personal self-confidence and view of myself that I had to do hard work, right? You had to do the work right now.

[00:55:03] I'm, you know, I I And then once you take a middle school kid who's top 1% as they go into high school, they're not going to give it up because and there's this mental view of, oh, I guess I am a smart kid, right? Or I'm a capable kid, right? And that unlock is so valuable. And so for us, that's when, you know, we think, you know, juicing it with money.

[00:55:25] I mean, we spend 20 grand a kid in this country per student, right? and you're like in middle school give a kid $1,000 in order to have them realize there is that the height there's no limit. Why does why would most people I assume listening to us have sort of an uneasy feeling about that? like they can't reconcile what you just said, which is, well, wait a minute. On the one hand, I know we're spending $20,000 per year per kid on these kids, and we're getting nothing for it. And you're proposing we give them a couple of those thousands of dollars strategically to incentivize half of the equation, which is them having the motivation to do this. And yet, that's going to make a lot of people feel uneasy. Why? So there's a view uh that there needs to be an intrinsic love of learning for it to be pure and that if you it has to be intrinsic not exttrinsic and that if you're buying it it's sullied and not good right it's just it's wrong it's fundamentally wrong and you know and that is a common view are there any data that would support one view being favorable to the other how would that be studied >> there there is a set of papers that have written that show that you know if somebody is not intrinsically motivated or is intrinsically motivated and you pay them they lose intrinsic motivation.

[00:56:43] Now that's not the case that we're sitting with. We have kids who aren't motivated who aren't intrinsically going through it, right? They need the boost. Um, and if you actually ask alpha kids, and maybe we'll do a study someday, no parent who has their kids at alpha thinks, "My kids lost their intrinsic motivation." If anything, it's the opposite because now they think they're capable. And those papers don't talk about is how much of the issue was, I didn't think I was capable. I now realize I am. And I get this crazy intrinsic boost around it. Right? I my youngest daughter again would be this example which is you know she came in to middle school you know at uh she hit top 10%. And her >> by the end of 8th grade >> sorry this was before this is going into seventh grade. >> Okay. >> She was top 10% coming in. So she had been there but she's like dad I'm not like my older sister. I'm not top 1%.

[00:57:45] Right. That's just not who I am. Right. I'm Tik Tok girl. you know, if we're going to And I was like, you know, uh, you know what I know, you know, love more than anything is shopping. And I'll bet you $1,000 that you can't get to top 1%. And so, she literally would fill her Amazon cart with $1,000 of stuff. And in the morning, she'd then look and look at the lessons she had to go through and she'd do it, right? She'd just grind through it. Now, back to this thing.

[00:58:17] It's, you know, we had a lot of family discussions around this cuz my wife, right, she was like, "Wait, there's two things, and this is most parents are are like this. There's two things here. One, you're setting 1% top 1%." And most parents are like, "That's too hard, right? And, you know, why are you putting that pressure, you know, for on on the kid? And number two, it doesn't feel right to pay a,000 bucks to get this. This is just We're all brought up that there's something wrong." And so, and but back to the thing. So she does it. She hits top 1% literally buys everything. But then she sits down right with my wife and she's like, "Mom, I know you didn't like us doing this, but you need to understand what this has done for me, which is I never thought I was as smart as my older sister and now

[00:59:04] I realize I can do everything, right, that she can do and it's totally changed my internal view, right?" And that element there of right her and now back she's also the one now who's top 1% on the SAT trying to decide if she wants to do the extra work to get a perfect score right that their that change in their view of their capability that unlock is so valuable and I believe we should do this for every kid in

[00:59:31] America right that but that's the dynamics of why people don't like it and it's you then just have to decide if you can use exttrinsic motivation whatever it is buy them concert tickets buy them right go shopping, whatever, whatever motiv screen time, video game time, whatever it takes to get the kid to realize I can go be and learn all this and be top 1% when I previously didn't think that, right? And I go through that struggle, fail, sometimes cry on the road to success loop. That then unlocks my human potential. And right, the point of education beyond academics, right?

[01:00:07] You're trying to unlock human potential. And this is just a great easy way to do it. And it it's not available system. Yeah, >> that's the thing. You don't it it's not necessarily something that has to happen indefinitely. It's it it's what I what I think makes sense here is that it's it's an unlock that then creates a new state of awareness >> that therefore becomes self-perpetuating. So in many ways it's like the kindling that leads to the fire. >> You don't need kindling indefinitely.

[01:00:36] Sometimes you need kindling. >> Exactly. that I think that's I'm going to steal that from you because that's a great way to think about it which is I'm not paying her to to decide to go get a perfect score on her SAT. I don't need the extra, right? It's intrinsic, right? It's her decision. It's her capability.

[01:00:50] She just needed that kindling to to to jumpstart it and un whatever block was in the mind, right? You're all right. Good coaches, they're like, "How do I unblock them?" And that's what this does. Uh, you know, and since we're on this of paying, I'll give you my my second one, which if I >> um uh the secretary of education is coming down next week to meet with

[01:01:10] McKenzie around alpha stuff. And if there's one thing to fix education in America, just the what's the simplest unlock, it would be this, which is and it's all around whole filling and and paying kids, which is so when I first started, um I wanted kids to go back and who fill, right? We call filling, go back and do your prerexs. And so I'm sitting down with the seventh graders, the boys. And

[01:01:37] I'm like, "Guys, you could get 100 or before that." I'm sitting down with them and you know what does not motivate a stu seventh grader? Doing fourth grade. >> No kid wants to do that, right? No one wants to be going back. And the only people who want it less than the kid are their parents. Yeah. >> Their parents are like, "Every parent in

[01:01:55] America has been trained my kid needs to be at grade level, right?" Which once again, the learning science does, right? That is not right. get your kid to master the basics and if it's pre previous material, give it to them. Um, and so I and I tried to convince parents, look, your kid needs a whole fill if we're going to get this thing whole thing working and stuff. And I basically ended up giving up on the parents. And so then

[01:02:17] I went to the seventh graders and I was just like, okay, here we go, guys. You could get a hundred on the Texas Star, you know, our state test. They're like, no way, Mr. Leebot. I'm like, no, no, no. Well, in centure I'll give you a $100 bill for 100 on the test. They're like, that's still impossible. I'm like, no, no, no. There's a catch, any grade level.

[01:02:41] They're like, I can take a kindergarten Texas Star and you can give me 100 bucks. I was like, well, it starts in the third grade. They're like, I'm in. They take the third grade Texas Star, they get 100. I give them a $100 bill. They're like, a fourth grade? I'm like, absolutely. Same thing. 100 get 100. >> By fifth grade, they're running into >> they got 75 to 85, right? They get 75 to 85. They holes.

[01:03:07] And I'm like, well, do you want the AI tutor to generate the lessons you missed? And they're like, well, let me see how many it is. They're like, I can do that in a week. They're in, right? Get the hundred then, you know, and on the way sixth and then seventh grade and for $400. $400 >> and you brought a kid up to grade level >> up to grade level. But more importantly, they all think they can get and know they can get a hundred on the state test, which used to be only the GT kids and the smart kids get it. Like if you survey incoming alpha parents and say, "Can your kid get 100 on the Texas

[01:03:43] Star?" Fewer than 10% say yes, they can. After you've been at Alpha a year, 90% of kids are like, "I can totally get a 100red on Texas Star." Because they've done it right. our building, you know, over there, you know, gets more hundreds on the Texas Star than a school district of 100,000 kids, right? And it's just because we have a mastery based system where you tell them. So our advancement now and is built into our system is we'll actually advance a kid if they get over 90, right? What is our mastery standard? It's in the 90s. So you have to score on the state test above a 90 to move on to the next grade level material. But we also have a hundred for a hundred. And so the kids are like, "Okay, well, I guess I'm just going to get the hundred because I want to get the $100 bill." And so you have this concept where and it just changes them where I could advance. >> That's an interesting experiment in and of itself. It's it's sort of what we would call a natural experiment because it's not randomized, which is >> if the kid is motivated um basically just to do the bare minimum, they're going to just take the 90, >> right? And so you so and if you make it a hundred it just back to there's a little reality of bring your parents and everybody along with you on this crazy journey we're on and so that 100 lets us out of it which is you know when you get to the higher material and you've done 90 our app's still going to go back and fill those 10% cuz it's the best way to learn but it's just get them advanced let them go and and do that but the hundred the kids all just do it because they know they can and it just gets the right mindset going which is why our kids literally for the SAT. Everybody thinks, you know, oh, you can't get perfect scores. They're like, it's just some extra work, right? Like fives on

[01:05:24] APs. People are like, that seems impossible. Like, oh, how many hours is it, right? It takes 75 hours to go through like AP world history or AP uh US history. It's 75 hours. And they're like, oh, I got, you know, 15 hours left to get a five. And so, you just change the concept that these, you know, now there's some upper bound where there is, you know, conceptual understanding and everybody can't get there. But K through8 curriculum, what would change education in America? We can totally do this. So, let's now talk about the AI piece, which we haven't really explicitly talked about. And and you >> you you you said something to me once that I think was actually remarkable, which which you used you compared it to medicine, right? You compared education to medicine in terms of an unlock. So, so talk a little bit about that. >> You know, if you go back, you know, to um the sciences, right? And whether it's biology or medicine, chemistry, physics, all of these had periods in the wilderness, I'm sure doctors bloodletting and things like this. But there was the invention of an instrument, right, in each of those that allowed more precise measurement that unlocked and inflected the science, right? And medicine had theirs. I don't know which one you thought. >> I think I Yeah. When I've heard you discuss this, I think it's the light microscope. If you were going to talk about one instrument that took us from what would what I describe as the dark ages of medicine 1.0 into medicine 2.0 which is where we are today >> that inflection point came primarily around without the light microscope it couldn't have happened. Sid Muker wrote very eloquently about this in his most recent book, The Cell. But basically, until we could actually start to see microscopic organisms, we couldn't really handle germ theory, >> right? >> And until we could eradicate germ theory, we couldn't really live past about 40 on average, right? There were just too many people dying too young.

[01:07:18] And so that one piece of technology unleashed an entire change in the way medicine has been practiced which of course has spread out far beyond infectious diseases but but that's I I think it's impossible for me to imagine a scenario whereby we are alive today in the way we are without that >> right so and so when you when you look at AI that learning science these papers have been written for 40 years but they all start with this doesn't work with a teacher in front of of a classroom timebased model, right? You need to change it up. >> So, you had the solution, you had the conceptual solution for the last 40 years on how to fix education, right? >> But there's been no technology to make it happen. >> You can't microscope. You we haven't had our microscope. And AI is finally that microscope because of a couple things.

[01:08:07] The first is, you know, before, you know, your effect size when you put an experiment, you know, into a classroom, you're like, well, is the teacher teaching it correctly? you know, is it, you know, using space repetition correctly? Are the students engaged? You know, do they have the prerex? You just don't know. And so your environmental variables dominate your effect size. And with AI, right, you could you get two things. You get absolutely precise teaching. You know exactly what is being told to the kid. And then second, you have this closed loop measurement. You can measure what do they know and what they don't know. And so you know the prere, you know all of it. And then you can create you can do science you can create this closed loop. So our system right we rolled out our new system time back you know to the student to to all our all our students this year a couple weeks ago and like our math curriculum we believe this year is going to be uh better kids will learn more in 20% less time and we know that because we've been measuring it and we looked on last year's math and we're able to say okay we have this idea okay the kids what percent learned were they 95% rate how long did it take each kid to go through the lesson, what do we need to change?

[01:09:21] What learning science concept can we put in the lesson, right? That's going to then allow them to learn better and faster and what's going to change the scheme of their brain, you know, not cramming, but really understanding this. And then, okay, they took the standardized tests. Oh, look, it did work, right? And you can just create this closed loop system where you're able to do science, right? And that be nobody else has that. And that's the that's the problem, right? is we need to create that system but to do that you have to give up like the most treasured notion in the world which is the key to good education is a teacher in front of a classroom right one of the things that's true about education you know 200 years ago before there was tutors right you had you know Socrates and Plato and

[01:10:06] Aristotle and Alexander the great and all the elite had tutors right and then 200 years ago like we have to educate everybody the only way cost-effectively to do that is teacher in front of a classroom And that is all any of us know, our parents know, our grandparents know. We've all been in that. >> And it did great things because at scale we have educated people that never would have been educated before because what fra I mean I wouldn't have I wouldn't have been one of the tutored ones. >> Correct. Right. >> And it is and you can go to the poorest school district in India and there's a teacher in front of a classroom, not a very nice building. You can go down to whatever private school that's charging you $50,000 teacher in front of a classroom in a very nice building. But that model is all we know and we think and great teachers matter. And this is always the part with our new model and

[01:10:52] AI tutors that I I I want to take a second here because people get freaked out. Adults 20 years from now parents are going to drop their kids off at a building and in that building are going to be other kids and adults. And those adults you can call them teachers, guide, coaches, whatever you want. You know, we think the day will be very different. But that concept of a school with teachers and other students, that's not going away. We're not moving to this

[01:11:22] AI robot terminator, you know, whatever. That's not that's not what's coming. Kids are going to you're going to drop the kids off at a school, right? And it's going to now if we do our job right, you don't sit in class for six hours a day and have this miserable experience that kids love it and all of those. But back to the the science of it, we now with AI, right, can have a one-on-one relationship. The AI knows what does the kid know? What do they not know? How do I give them this lesson?

[01:11:51] And if you look and if you want to talk just about where we're headed, the future is even, you know, Gen AI is changing everything. That was the the part for me that I saw which is I can craft personalized lessons for every kid that takes into account you know what goes into the LLM sort of on the technology side you have what what are you trying to teach them what's the curriculum what is their knowledge graph what do they know and what do they not know what is their interest graph right what are they interested in because actually if I know your interests I can engage it oh you want to learn baseball I You love baseball and you want to learn stats.

[01:12:33] I'm going to term it in that and kids are going to get engaged. Do it. Oh, you're the fashionista who's, you know, I'm going to teach you fractions. >> Is the app already able to do what you just described? >> So, where we are today in 2025, we generate static content with human review because we still have too many hallucinations. >> Okay. >> And so, we're not we're not there. Now, in 2026, we expect we'll be able to do it. There is one >> meaning just to make sure I'm putting this in perspective. So, my 8-year-old, who is that kid who loves baseball, >> and all he does is talk baseball stats.

[01:13:05] He's a literally, he is a walking baseball statistic. >> Do you know so and so hit 326 and this many home runs? And do you know he was able to hit 477 feet blah blah blah. So, he will be able to get to know his AI tutor. They will figure out in short order that the way to his heart is baseball. And anything that you can teach in baseball terms, he's fixated. >> Exactly. And AI will be able to give him a lesson >> to to pursue mastery, >> but under the guise of baseball. >> Under baseball. Right. Amazing. And it's just and we all know this, which is you're always that's what teachers are always trying to do is how do I get what the kids like and associate with it. But at scale, you don't have 30 kids who like all the same things, you know, etc.

[01:13:50] So here's an example of what you can actually do today. There's if you um we have a there so static you know you have hallucinations and so you don't you don't want to release those yet but we have a dynamic um reading generator it's called teach tales and the goal of this is to get kids to love to read. So if you take a third grade boy who's like I hate books right I hate books I'm not a book guy and you're like what's your favorite movie? Uh the Avengers. Who are your soccer buddies? Okay. And you create the AI generates a choose your own adventure where you're saving the world with your soccer buddies and you know they have to keep clicking each be an Avenger >> and EP1 and literally and the Lexile level right the difficulty goes up it knows right so it's keeping you in the zone of proximal development within 10% of you know what you know your Lexile level kids will sit there and click for an hour right just totally engaged >> non-stop reading >> non-stop and just all of a sudden you know because we do have a reading problem in this country people don't read books and all these

[01:14:52] This is the kind of thing where Gen AI is going to be able to suck kids in, right? And you know, our competition is Fortnite and Tik Tok, right? And we need to use things like Gen AI to create such compelling content for kids that's related to what they care about. That also teaches, okay, I got to teach you fractions, but we're doing this baseball thing, so you're fine, right? You love that. Um, you know, there's a whole program that a lot of people in finance where, you know, uh, and there's there's actually a program where they have a mother daughter thing back to a different way to try to solve it without an AI tutor where there's all these finance moms who teach their daughters poker in middle school and they're like,

[01:15:33] I'm going to get them into poker to teach all these skills and the math skills and all the things that aren't being taught in my school. But with us, we can get that engagement level where the kids are interested in it. And to give you a couple examples and I'll use uh some of our high school kids. So, you know, when you transfer into, you know, uh Alpha High, your knowledge of history is very limited, which is if it's in the musical Hamilton, you know, it occurred.

[01:16:02] And if it didn't occur, you know, if it's not in a song in Hamilton, you don't know it, you know, because we don't teach history very much anymore. And but all the kids know Hamilton. They all sing songs. So our our US history, AP world history, they literally used AI. They did this on their own. It wasn't our stuff. They used AI to generate here's all the facts. You know, there's nine units in US history. For each unit, they created a song and they said, give me all the facts that I need to know for this unit. And they pumped it into Sumo, which is an available, you know, song generator. And they got they created just their own album of songs.

[01:16:40] And they all would just sit around and sing the songs and, you know, learn the facts that way and do it in a way they all were very interested in, right? And they all got fives on their AP because you can do it to mastery and and so Gen AI is going to allow us to create this awesome dynamic content that's relatable, you know, and focused on what or uh applicable to what kids want. The other part is you know there's a learning science concept also builds a van frameworks of you know the fastest way to learn is basically analogy and so do you have a knowledge graph right >> this is the a in the ABC so so Dean

[01:17:15] Schwarz's book which I guess we're going to link to that in in the show notes goes through a toz everything that learning science has come up with >> exactly right so he has so Dean Schwarz from Stanford right school of education one of the leaders in the field >> right has written a book and he's like here it is you know um and every letter has a different one but this one >> a is analogy is one of the ones I remember >> and analogies right where that's the fastest way to learn and so if you know what a kid knows like part of we have a content team when I talk about those hundred facts ideas and concepts per hour what they're using as reference is they're using Tik Tok memes as cuz kids know Tik Tok right and they know what's on Tik Tok and you're like well let's take what we're trying to teach them and use something they already know And that's actually the fastest way to have kids learn concepts. And so those are all coming. Then even when you talk even further, the part we don't have in yet, but you know, our our team's working on it is we also take into account, we will be taking into account the cognitive load, right? This of their brain, which is >> we know we're going to be able to create a lesson that where we know how many working memory slots you have. We know what you know to fluency and what you don't. and we're not going to give you a question that's going to overload your working memory or we also know how many reps you need, right? And GT kids need fewer reps and so we're not going to bore you by giving you too many reps to memorize it. Conversely, we're going to make sure you have enough reps if if you need them. And so this personalized learning where you're generating the content dynamically um I is going to be just this crazy unlock for these kids. Um, and you know, five years from now, everybody's going to look back and be like, "Okay, well, obviously, you know, kids can learn 10 times faster." You know, it's we're we wake up every day and they're just like, you know, it's like Neo in the Matrix, right? Where that's a physical upload.

[01:19:07] Ours is, right? Using learning science concepts, kids can learn 10 times faster. And when you think about that, you have 12 years, right? You have 12 years to fill your kids' head with cool stuff, knowledge, right? because they have to hang out in that right in their brain for the the rest of their life.

[01:19:26] And we've allocated 12 years to fill it up. We just need two hours a day at 10 times faster. And all the kids can have more stuff and more cool stuff about stuff they like in their heads to mastery level levels none of us as as parents could ever imagine, right? And still give the kids their time back for the rest of the day to do all other things. about three years ago you sort of decided like that you know you got to step out of trilogy right like it's this incredible company you've built um are any of your co-founders still there I think it's you're you're sort of are they >> no so I people who've been so three years ago sort of the transition was when Gen AI came out right which was three years ago neural nets are here >> finally and you know that was an unlock for me where I had seen McKenzie's great school and seen, you know, my kids in there and there were issues like my daughter failing her seventh grade test and stuff where the apps aren't good enough, you know, and all those issues and I'm like, Genai will allow us to take the magic of alpha, >> make it better, and scale it to a billion kids, right? Because there's there's lots of good educational things that just don't scale. And so what this was was my realization. >> This was your light microscope. >> This was it. Light microscope's here.

[01:20:45] Okay. I've been doing software. So I went to my team who've been there for 25 years. I'm like, "Guys, for 25 years you've been telling me you're better than me. We'll see. I'm going to go be a principal." And so they run it. You know, I'm now, you know, chairman and I am now literally the worst shareholder you've ever seen. Cuz I'm like, "Guys, I need more cash flow. I need more dividends to fund this whole thing. You know, Mackenzie needs $300 a million dollars to open up all these schools. You know, where are we going to, you know, get it for her?" So, so how much of your money have you spent on this now? >> So, I took on three years ago, I took a billion dollars out of Trilogy sort of as my first lump sum and said, I'm going to go use this billion dollars to figure out what I can with education and fix as much as I can. Now, what's crazy about that is a billion dollars is not enough to fix education. It's a trillion dollar industry and we obviously have made incredible headway, but we have to go back to building schools, right? Back to

[01:21:44] Mackenzie, she's opening up, you know, 25 schools, 25 alphas around the country, right? She needs hundreds of millions of dollars for that. We're opening up these sportsmies, which needs hundreds of millions. We're opening up 500 gifted, talented schools, right? So, you know, the total capex that's going to be required. The second part is I'm going to do this the next 20 years, right? I got 20 years in this, right? My job is to go fix education, right? and make get it to a billion kids and give kids their time back, right? Change change use the light microscope, use AI to totally change the first 12 years of, you know, a billion kit. >> Now, at what point, Joe, do the two systems have to merge? Because one of the reasons that you're having to deploy such insane amounts of capital is because you're basically rebuilding things that are technically already there. I mean, we have buildings, we have schools, we have guides, they're called teachers, we have all those things, but you're creating a new system of infrastructure. But I assume you don't want to scale. >> You don't want to have to build the scale to a billion. At some point, this way has to merge with the existing way.

[01:22:51] At what point does that merger take place? Well, my view is there's a point of if I had perfect randomized control trials with, you know, back to a billion kids. I don't know, do I need 10 million kids going through it for everybody to be like, okay, this looks like it works. But the bar is so low. I mean, I guess that's the thing that's amazing to me, right? And I think about um places in medicine, right, where massive clinical trials are necessary to to to change the direction of something. >> Usually when the state of play is so bad. So let's let's talk about an example which again I don't use this example to be offensive offensive to people that are within education, right? >> But like let's look at HIV in the 80s and early 90s. It was a death sentence.

[01:23:40] Like the bar was pretty darn low when heart therapy highly anti high highly active antiretroviral therapy came out in 95 or 96 and that I mean that's it like boom we just changed the protocol now of course pharma is easier than education in the sense that it's you know a simple intervention it's a you know but >> who's pushing back right >> when you say hey guys >> what if we just prove this out in a million kids Right. >> Like why do I need 10 million kids to prove >> especially with Yeah. Especially if they're spread out over a broad enough socioeconomic background. >> Exactly. And so back to that's my sort of our next phase, right? And why I'm doing my first podcast in 20, you know, years is that uh there's a lot of there's a lot of impediments to it. Let's go back to that discussion of parents don't care about academics. So, we'll start there and

[01:24:39] I'll we'll do that. Second, believability. There's been edtech pitches, right? Everybody every five years, edtech's going to solve the world. And, you know, technology is always going to solve the world and it doesn't solve it. And so, there is good well-earned natural skepticism of, you know, there's a lot's just go let's just and let's just take it right. >> Evil billionaire tech guys trying to fix education are the right the >> it's a meme. No, it's a meme like make a movie. And so the skepticism should be super high, right? And it is. And so that's part of what the job is and why it takes a billion dollars to we have to go prove it across every right across everybody. Um, and in a broad way. So completely agree with that. But let's talk about some of the problems with it, which is, you know, let's talk about academics right here in Austin, right?

[01:25:33] There's there's been three failing middle schools in Austin, right? And you know, I look at if I was a superintendent of a school or principal of a public school. I mean, like I I want to be really clear that's like a hundred times harder job than mine because, you know, I'm a product guy. People who come to my school are aligned with what I'm building and my offering cuz it's you get selection effects.

[01:25:55] People come to Alpha are like, I know I'm going to have screen time for two hours cuz if you don't, you don't come right. But at public school, you know, these two schools are Fs for five years. They're not educating the kids. >> And the superintendent, you know, he made his first proposal, whatever, months ago. He's like, "Well, why don't we shut these schools and we have these a better schools right by and the kids just go to the school where the kids are learning, you know, and literally the protests that have been from parents, you know, and it's, you know, and you listen to them, you know, and you know, it's the mom who's just like, "Look, I know that seventh grade math teacher. she's probably not teaching math very well, but my older daughter had her and that she changed her life and so you know what and my kids can walk to school and it's community and so if they don't learn seventh grade math so much so what and so the you know the superintendent you know he's you know you if you take into account the community feedback which they're supposed to all of a sudden you have parents who are like I care about other things cuz school's a bundle and so that makes this hard so there's one just do they even want it the second is obviously just skepticism ism of this doesn't really work and you know why don't we do randomized control tiles or pharmaceutical caliber stuff with education because there's all these ideas of what work we we have a lot of ideas that we're rolling out like no multiplication tables that somebody should have done control child to realize that's a really bad idea right and so all these fads in education because it's not science right the learning science is not if you actually ask one of the scariest data points if you want this go. There's 3 million teachers in the world. They're not taught learning science.

[01:27:33] They're not taught learning science. And so, you know, these concepts will be new to them. And so, back to how do we fix it? We have to go teach all the all the teachers about learning science. Do do you get push back on that point? Do you do you get I mean, how much time do you spend talking with the teachers that are in the trenches right now? Um, I'll give you an analogy from my world, right? So, you know, I talk about this idea of medicine 3.0, right? So, we're medicine 2.0 has been amazing. Like, it's an amazing run. You and I wouldn't be alive without it. Literally, we would be dead by now. Um, but I would argue like it's time to move on. We've plateaued. Like, we got to do medicine 3.0, right? We have to unlock the next thing. Um, but when I say that, I'm not being critical of the doctors who practice medicine 2.0 cuz I haven't met many of them who wouldn't in a heartbeat say, "Look, I wish I could do medicine 3.0, but the system I'm in doesn't allow it.

[01:28:27] I can't get reimbursed to practice medicine 3.0. I the entire system of billing and coding and diagnostics and prescribing, it's all predicated on this system. Uh it's predicated on make the diagnosis for the disease, treat the there's no prevention. I I I I don't get paid to, nor do I have the education to learn about nutrition, exercise, all of these other things that are necessary in medicine 3.0. But if I could wave a magic wand, my bet is 80% of them would be like if there's a way to fix the system and the structure such that I can be balancing my practice between 2.0 and 3.0, I do in a heartbeat. >> Do you have a sense? Have you got enough reps with teachers to understand if you had that that proverbial magic wand? How many of the superintendents and the teachers would say, "Oh my god, I'd love to be to transition from being a front of the classroom um teacher to an in the classroom guide who's helping the student with the AI with their personal

[01:29:26] AI tutor." >> Correct. So the answer is it is at least 80% like same example which is teachers. No, no, because we have you know our guides, right? They're ex-teers, right? I mean, and we got into this whole name naming thing, but you know, do you call them teachers if they're not doing academics and and what whatnot? But fundamentally, you know, when they tell their story of what they do all day and let's just talk about teachers specifically, right? Teachers are great and critical and teacher in front of the classroom is bad, right? That's it's and it's the but to your point, it's the system that's very similar analogy. It's the same thing where you know teachers right they got into teaching to transform kids' lives. They did not become a teacher to grade the seventh grade science test right and so let the

[01:30:13] AI do the seventh grade lesson and the science test and you connect with your kid right your students. So during our two-hour blocks, we do 25minute pomodoros, right? Our guides, ex-teers who don't, they're not in front of the class lecturing. They literally take the kids one on- one, you know, and say, "Hey, don't do you know your uh language today. Come sit down and talk to me for 25 minutes. How was your weekend? How'd the softball tournament go? Hey, you don't seem as motivated lately. What's going on?" And they connect with them, right? And they're the ones right our guides do to right they provide motivational and emotional support. They set high standards and high support. They're the ones guiding these kids right through the journey. And that's why teachers became teachers, right? They didn't I I want to write a lesson plan. Nobody woke up and said that's why I'm becoming a teacher. They did it because they want to transform kids' lives. And that's what this new model does, right? And so when they see it, they love it. Right?

[01:31:14] So that's what you know we one we pay more but also the parent the kid the teachers see our model and once they really understand it and talk to our existing ones they're like this is awesome I love this and so there isn't resistance now at the systems level you know so I've talked to a lot of superintendent and they're like what what do you want me to do with this what am I supposed to do they're like I to our what do the kids do the rest of the day right this is the problem. This when you talk about it, this is a rebuild around the school day. >> Yep. >> It's not six hours a day in class, right, with teachers and moving kids between class. >> Two hours a day of learning in the screen and four hours a day of life skills, work, sports, and all the sorts of other things that are going to be imperative to create well balanced kids, >> right? And you know, our life skills curriculum is leadership, teamwork, storytelling, public speaking, right? relationship building, socialization, right? Grit and hard work, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, right? Those things. And they're doing workshops in the afternoon, right?

[01:32:20] They're, you know, this is if you go to Mackenzie's Instagram, it's, you know, kids climbing rock walls, you know, in kindergarten or they're running 5Ks in second grade or the fifth graders launched a food truck, you know, and so there's all these different things running tough mutters eighth or eighth graders, you know, do that stuff. And so you're like, if you're a superintendent, you're like, "Okay, my system's not set up for this." And there's just there's no end right now. There's no demand from the parents because it's it's not proven. It's not obvious. And even and let's even get out of public school, okay? Let's go just talk about super high-end private schools, right? You can go down the street and try to get convince this super high-end private school and say, "You have all the flexibility you want. There's no vote.

[01:33:00] There's nothing. You should transform." and they're like, "Oh my, this seems like a bridge too far." Right? And so that's why my my view of my job. >> So is that why essentially Alpha exists as an independent school at the moment is you just need to get the scale of wholly owned alphas that that build this out and at some point the others probably the private schools have an easier time joining the model. Yeah. And and and eventually the hope is of course the the public schools do so as well. >> Exact everybody. So I got 20 years and I got to get a billion kids. So you got to, you know, 80 90% of kids are in public school. You got to get it to public school and provide it to everybody. >> What What is the current cost to cuz I'm sure you're hemorrhaging and losing money at the moment. What is the current cost to deliver uh the education to a school to a child and does it vary by their grade like a middle school? >> Stepping back and so for our job is and that's why we're opening across country in every city there's going to be this alpha exemplar, right? the high-end where you're like this is what's possible now it's also one where it's money no object it's really expensive and back to the things today my AI I'm using the latest models is you know we're real time streaming video to to coach kids you know it's 10,000 bucks a kid and so it's >> $10 per kid per year in just AI >> just in the AI cost it's too much now >> I absolutely believe and our our team's going to deliver it where you know sometime in the next three years maybe five. You know, everybody on the planet will have a tablet that's less than $1,000 that will teach them everything they need to know in 2 hours a day or less. >> And the compute will be what do you think? >> Local. It'll be local. >> It'll be local. >> Yeah. So, you'll be on device. >> Like a lot of our stuff right now is vision models where we're looking stuff.

[01:34:50] You there's ondevice and the all the hardware manufacturers are putting their AI chips on device where we're we'll hit that. >> Wow. Um, and so you know, and and I'm sure there's still be some stuff in the cloud for higherend stuff, but you what the Common Core curriculum through 8th grade on device less than $1,000. That's absolutely coming. Uh, and then and then then the second part is, you know, and part of what Alpha is is because it's this high-end expensive stuff, you're like, let's reinvision what a school is from the ground up, right? So we sit around, you know, I'm a product I'm like what makes what would make a school 10 times better than you know old school that that we went to you know and so we we sort of have five dimensions that we do and the first is kids must love school and we literally measure more than vacation like that has to be it and we get 50ish% of kids depends on the vacation depends on the workshop if it's really good 50% of kids who are like yeah I want to I want to go to school instead of vacation I have plenty of parent well my highlight as a principal because, you know, in in May uh this year, twothirds of the high school kids sent me a note and they're like, "Can we keep Alpha High open this summer cuz we don't want to take a summer break cuz we love what we're doing." Right? The girl doing her, you know, Broadway musical. She's like, "This is I I want to keep coming to school and doing it, right?" And so, you know, we're, you know, back to my world where I was not into school. I was, you know, sherking and my dad, you know, I'm like, "Make a place where kids love school." Um, and vacation's a good standard. Number two, kids need to learn 10 times faster. We just we need an engine that teaches kids 10 times faster. And so our AI tutor based on learning science teaches kids 10 times faster, right? And between five and 10 and we'll get it up and you know, so that's the second part so that you can then that gives you the chance to give the time back. The third dimension of a school is what are if you academics isn't everything, right? To developing kids everybody knows that. What are the life skills that every parent says that is what I wish I knew? And some are, you know, traits, behavioral traits. I hope they they are love learning and are self-driven learner, right? You want things like that. And I want somebody who uplifts others in his classroom and behavioral and is an independent person.

[01:37:09] Others are like those ones I talked about where you're like, "No, I want entrepreneurisism and financial literacy or I want storytelling, public speaking, those those type skills." And so the third is have that curriculum, >> the suite of skills, >> the suite of skills that every parent wants. So we actually have spent, you know, the last three years developing life core, right? The common core curriculum for life skills that cuz I have four hours a day to fill, right, with all this awesome stuff that kids can do. And it's just amazing what they do. Like if you take Atomic Habits, right, that book of 1% better, most people don't read that till after college, right? And then they're like, "Oh, this is a way I can really develop." Last year, you know, our guide

[01:37:51] Faith second grade guide, you know, she sat down and she was working on her her workshops, you know, her life skills. She's like, "You know what? I want to teach atomic habits to all the second graders because the concepts they all can understand." >> And she's like, "You know how I'm going to do it?" I'm like, she's like, "I'm going to have all our second graders run a 5K in under 35 minutes."

[01:38:14] And that interest I'm like oh no okay the parents are not gonna like that right that's too hard back to high standards they don't want struggle fail it where's that road to success part and what percent are going to make it and so I was she's like don't worry it's to I can do this she was a UT athlete and she's like we totally can do it she was a like a head cheerleader or whatever she's like everybody can do this and so she sits down with the second graders first day and is who who can run a 5K? And they're all like, "That's impossible,

[01:38:47] Miss Faith." The parents all are like, "That's impossible, Miss Faith." She's like, "Well, I signed you all up for the jingle 5K, you know, at the domain." And so she goes out to the track and the first day they walk it and they walk 5k. She's like, "Okay, so we all established you're going to finish the race, right?

[01:39:04] And then the next time they ran a quarter lap, walk the rest. Next time half a lap, walk the rest." And by December, right, all the kids are running the race, right? And you know, when they cross the finish line, just that achievement back to the key to your kids happiness is high standards. That's a really high standard, but they loved it. And they did have to struggle and go through and learn this, but they also learned that life skill of 1% better, right? And so the second graders like, "Dad, I can do anything. I can do 50 push-ups. I'll do one today and two tomorrow." And, you know, build up. And that skill, that life skill, we don't teach kids in school. It's a great life skill to have. And if you have half the day, you can do that. So that's the third element of like how do you build a great a great school. The fourth element, and this gets to the teachers, what would make a teacher 10 times better than what it is today? And the answer is well, not grading science tests all day and you know, writing lesson plans, but instead connecting mentorship with the kids, >> right? And so we ask here's the questions we ask you know the students and the parents which is to kids you know you know kindergarten we're like do you love your guide right and but you know as you get older it's every adult had one or two teachers who transform their life right back to that is your guide that for you right and that is what our guides right that is the expectation that they are the ones that the students are like you are helping me achieve things that I didn't think is possible miss faith you told me, taught me how to do the impossible, right? And so that right that level and actually then you know at the parent side this gets into you know Dr. Joerger um you know has a book 10 to 25 right child psychologist development expert and it's you know from kids how to uh what matters for kids right from 10 to from 10 years old to 25 right and uh his whole theory mentor mindset you know high standards high support the the heart most parents are not high standards and high support which is what really matters to developed kids They're either low standards, high support. That's what happened to all our expectations. Or they're the inverse, high standards, no support. You know, this would be your classic, you know, tiger mom would be, you know, good luck. Figure it out, right? And the real answer for child development, you need both. High standards, high support. And so that's our guides. But the question we ask parents in middle and high school, right? Back to having what's a school reinvisioning it. It's like, do you trust your alpha guide to hold high standards for your kid so you as the parent can provide the unconditional love and support, right? Which transforms for those who've had adolescence, it transforms your relationship where you don't have to be the naggy parent for the high the high standards. You know, my daughter, my oldest daughter, you know, she's writing her college essay and I'm like, "You want to let me read it?" And she's like, "No." Right. No interest in that. >> Yeah. She's got she's got it taken care of. She's got someone else. >> And for me, I was super relaxed because

[01:42:14] I was like, I know Chloe, right? Back to our guide, right? She's a Harvard grad. I know she was to totally high standards for for my daughter and I know it's going to be fine and I don't have to get in a fight about it or whatever. I'm just like, okay. Yeah, I can give my daughter a hug and be like, "Good luck, right?" And so that transforms what teachers can be, right? versus I'm delivering those seventh grade lessons.

[01:42:37] And so, you know, and then the fifth dimension that we talk about is the C's, character, community, classmates, and culture. And these are also the hardest parts to measure, but at the end, they're what parents care about the most, right? Which is at the end of the day, all those other you don't character, right? Is do I have a good kid? Did I raise a good kid? Right? And is the school helping me make right raise a good kid? And so those elements are what we looked at and said now that you want to reinvision school right from the ground up. Here's the dimensions.

[01:43:11] And so Alpha is trying to be the exemplar you know for for all of it. And then the question is okay how do we get the price point down right? So we have opened a whole set of different schools right at half the price of Alpha right so Alpha depending on its location is between4 and $75,000 right? Um but we've opened >> although there's scholarship programs >> ton Oh so tons so we have a huge scholarship so you know we have a school down in Brownsville right where it's a second poorest school district um we have >> in Texas >> Brownsville is the second poorest school district in the country you know and at that school it's you know SpaceX uh is there so Starbase so you have a bunch of

[01:43:50] SpaceX kids and then we scholarship all the locals to come in and it's we're 6040 50/50 between that makeup and to be here. They all learn 2x in two hours, right? There's not a right back to where we we tested it out. It works with all kids. >> So, so I want to read you something that is fits right into this. So, this is um

[01:44:12] I think I read this in the New York Times. Before kindergarten, the children of the affluent are much more likely to be in preschool. By sixth grade, students in the richest school districts are four grade levels above children in the poorest school districts. That's just by sixth grade. By high school, richer kids average reading skills are five years ahead of poorer kids. By college, according to a 2017 study by

[01:44:40] Raj Chetty, children from the richest 1% of earners are 77 times more likely to go to Ivy League schools than children from families making $30,000 a year or less. Um, the academic gap between the affluent and less affluent is greater today than the achievement gap between white American and black American kids in the final days of Jim Crow. In other words, my read of this is that there is no greater predictor of academic success and failure than the wealth of your parents.

[01:45:20] So are you really suggesting that that could be wiped out? >> Wiped out. I there's always relative versus absolute and I believe we can raise the absolute standard right and maybe it's always an arms race and you know that and so but if you said today can we take where people are years behind >> instead of the gap being 77x could that gap be 1.2x whatever 100%.

[01:45:52] And the back to that issue cuz here's what what happens, right? You're in a rich school district, right? And I was up in New York and you know these are $75,000 private schools a teacher in front of a classroom. But every one of those parents also was spending $750 an hour on a tutor after school cuz the school wasn't teaching them back to that problem. But an extra 75 grand tutoring them 150 grand a year, right? And you right. Yeah, you need the tutor who's going to go back and fill the holes and stuff. And no, if I am in a school district, right, and I'm a poor school district, I I'm not I'm not I don't have the tutor. I don't have the access to that, right? You know, if you look in after COVID, right, the number one intervention and you know, a lot of government funding was spent to this was high dosage tutoring. Everybody knows this, right? It's not a secret. It's just it's expensive to give, you know, individualized tutoring. And there was a study that came out a few weeks ago or a month ago that was like it was really working and then sometimes it it they did some, you know, as it expanded out, it did less well. And the difference was when it was really working, it was one-on-one and then they started to say to save money, they had six one. And tutoring six to one is not right. It's not individualized. becomes a class driven, right? It's just that's the issue with, you know, if you have 30 kids, you can't generate an unending stream of content at 80 to 85% accuracy based on what the kid learns. >> It has to be one-on-one. >> It's just and it just that is the delta is for each kid. It's personalized learning. A personalized lesson plan is what every kid needs. And so and and I believe that if you get all the learning scientists together and say yes AI is the light microscope, don't you agree?

[01:47:43] And can we create a program, right, that's available to everybody, right? Then and I think they'd all say yes. Yes, we can. And that the the the the software is not insurmountable. Right? I believe we could do a you know I was actually talking to Stanford has their Stanford Accelerator for Learning which is you know how and Dean Schwarz runs it and I was like you know we could probably create an X-P prize right for an open-source available to everybody right you need you also need better credible people than me you you don't need me saying this you need Dean

[01:48:22] Schwarz and Stanford and the Ivy League right the people that everybody looks up to in education in America and saying we know this, we know this learning science, we can run, right? We can take Stanford CS and AI department with the learning science, right? And put that together and create this project, right, for not that much money that we can then get to every kid, right, and get it into every public school, right? They have the relationships with all the teachers where, you know, they don't need the randomized control trial or the skepticism you'd obviously get from talking to me. So, I this is all very doable. You know that's that is this mission we have. >> What is the biggest risk right now? Is it the equivalent of what we call market risk where it's just adoption? It's just it's the leap of faith that >> we can somehow abandon the only model any of us know or >> is there still technology risk embedded within the AI that says >> yeah I mean >> there is still some technology risk but that's literally like you can ratchet down and you don't have to be 10 times learner but could we get them three times five times today with more static versus some of the cool dynamic stuff that yes you could right but it's are you willing to change the motivational model for the kids? Are you willing to tell the kid use this app and I'll give you your time back? Are you willing to say you don't have to sit in class for six hours a day? Right? It's it's the rebuild that's the problem. Right? When we if you take our software, our magic

[01:49:50] AI tutor, right? Whatever it is, and you put it in a standard classroom and the kid has to sit there for six hours a day, I can promise you it won't work. >> It will not work. And so that's the issue is are you really willing back to what Brian told me a decade ago. Are you really willing to say kids must love school?

[01:50:09] Are you really willing and then go rebuild your school system around that? Because if they do, they're going to engage in the app, right? They're going to you're going to give them their time back to do stuff they love. Is that all are you going to make those changes? Because it isn't an edte solution. It's not go build this edte, drop it, and it's going to work. That's just we have that. Those apps do generally work, right? And to get the real revolution, you need to say, are we going to rebuild what we think K through 12, the first 12 years of kids' lives are? And if that's true, then the sky is the limit. And what we're obviously doing is trying to say, look at this. Look at these examples. Right? Because parents parents need I've learned as a principal, they need two things to want to change the school. Remember, I was skeptical for two years, right? I'm I'm I'm the average parent, you know, was they need a reference from an adult they trust.

[01:51:04] How's it working for your kid? Did it work for your kid? And second, they need to see the kid do something at the school that their kid can't do, right? And if you have that, that's actually the magic that unlocks, you know, a parent saying, "Okay, I'm going to go I'm going to move to this new model."

[01:51:20] And you know what? What it is that the kid can't Oh, he loves school. Oh my god. He wakes up in the morning. you know, he's waking me up so he's not late and he used to cry on the way to school or oh wow some parents are like I love the academic performance right or those life skills I really care about or he connects with his teacher so much more as guide you know cuz it is different and back to the choices like why we're opening all these different schools we have a gifted talented school right we have a sports academy school we have a wilderness school right where you're fishing and archery and you know farming uh you know we're going to be opening arts theater

[01:51:54] Parents want different things and kids want different things. And so it's showing these things that is going to be the connection that causes parents to say I, you know, I want this. And if you do, and you know, if a good example about motivation, you know, if you put the GT moms, you know, McKenzie has, you know, her roundts, the GT moms with the sports academy moms, >> gifted and talented. >> Gifted. Sorry, that's GT. Gifted and talented. And then the the the sports academy moms, you know, and they just look at each other like the other parent is, you know, off the rocker where, you know, the the sports academy mom's like, you know, my kid was just, you know, comes home just sweating from just running around all day and I literally throw them in the shower with their clothes on, you know, and the GT mom's like, okay, they were having a chess tournament in the afternoon and then we came home and continued it, right? And it's and and it depends on the motivation. Each kid's different, right?

[01:52:46] And all your kids are different and you everybody knows that. And you know, like when we ask like I sat down with at the guides, we're like, "Okay, how do we make these all better?" So on, you know, staff days, you know, cuz we have all the guides from all the different schools. And I'm like, "Okay, what's going to make kids really love school?

[01:53:02] How do we get it from 50 to 60 to 70 on Love School, the G GT guides are like more, they want a third power hour of academics, and they want Math Olympi, and all the other guides are groaning because they're like, "No, our students do not want more academics. they want sports or let's do a better workshop or you know what what it's going to be. And so the key on all of this is saying how do we you know focus school on making it awesome for kids right making it great.

[01:53:29] Have a culture where it is high standards high support where you have this magic unlock of they can learn 10 times faster which then enables you to give them the time back to do all these other things. Um but that's a big lift right that's why it's it's gonna take 20 years right. Um but I do believe that you know everybody every parent right the most important thing is raising your kids it's the same at a societal level right the most important thing a society does is raise its next generation and everybody cares about it and one thing I we spend enough money in this country or globally right that there's enough money to actually rearrange this and build an education system that's great for for the kids um you know 5% of GMPP right I mean at $7 trillion right that there is recognition at both the societal or parent level right that this is where we should spend money and we do >> Joe it's kind of amazing to think back you in the spring of 1989 you drop out of college to go start a software company obviously there's no way you could have imagined uh both the success you would have in that company, you know, creating a multi-billion dollar company and and along with it a fortune for yourself, but then somehow deciding right at your peak that you were going to completely walk away from that take that fortune and pour it into another endeavor that seems as far from anything as possible relative to what you what you what you what you started with. Um, look, I feel really fortunate to to that that you're starting this that you started this in Austin. Uh for the listener, I think I probably should have said this at the outset. You know, my daughter spent two years at Alpha. It was an absolutely exceptional experience for her. Really kind of experienced all the things you talk about, right? So showed up in what did she show up? She showed up in seventh grade. Shows up in seventh grade with the absolute negative story of, you know, I love reading. I love arts. I love these things. I'm a musician. I'm not I just don't do math and science. Like that's I know you did,

[01:55:40] Dad. That's not me. I can't do math. I never want to do math. Um I made the awful mistake of spending the past year trying to help her do math. That was a disaster. That only resulted in tears. Um, but it really I think what what appealed to me when we made that switch was it just seemed so entirely logical that the reason she was struggling was because there were things in third and fourth grade she never mastered. And I I really appreciated the compounding nature of that gap. And and it it just made sense.

[01:56:18] It really clicked. And so it wasn't a big leap of faith to say, "Oh, okay." Yeah. And I feel very fortunate that as just as you predicted, um, by the end of 8th grade, I mean, she was acing math and that has continued all through high school. She did go back to public high school. I think, you know, that's probably something you you do encounter is that there are kids that ultimately just want to be back in the big public high school. They want to play sports on the public, you know, in the public high school. they want to be, you know, and of course she's at a high school with a billion kids. Um, and she's very happy there, but I I don't think there's a chance I don't think there's a snowballs chance in hell she would be doing as well as she is if not for the fact that she had that 2-year sbatical to Alpha where she um really got to academically create a solid foundation. And I I will share one last anecdote here, which is um at her eighth grade graduation, she was in tears saying goodbye to her guides. To your point, it's think of what the impact of those guides were on her life. She loved those people. And you know, it's not that she doesn't like her teachers in high school, but she doesn't have that kind of relationship with them. >> Right. And uh back to you know you guys were I came in actually you know right then and uh Andy M who runs our academics you know uh since you since you brought her up wants to give her a call out because she spent hours with him going through lessons helping figure out why is this not working or what is it? And you know, one of the things when you're you're starting these new schools, you need the this concept of a founding family, right? And you know, your family was one of the most important and your support where you you got it. But your daughter, you know,

[01:58:11] Andy wanted to say, you know, thank you to her because she did go above and beyond where our lessons and all this learning science and this closed loop, you know, he's like, I'm way better because of the feedback and the time she spent with us. And so, um, you know, it is it is transformative to kids and to your point of high school, you're not if you want to be the quarterback on the

[01:58:34] Westlake team and run track, we don't have those in our high school. And so, we can get you prepared. You know, we say our middle school prepares kids for any high school, right? And so all our kids in middle school can get get their pick of high school that they want to go. And some want alpha, you know, alpha high, which is that, but some want, you know, the traditional play, but we hopefully have equipped them where they know they're a self-driven learner and can do it on their own. >> Yeah. I'll tell you that maybe the last story I I'll I'll I'll share Joe which is no surprise to you is it really doesn't matter what corner and I mean this literally what corner of this planet I am standing on when education comes up your name always comes up and this is these are people who don't know that I know you right they don't know that we are friends and I'll be I will be literally on the opposite side of this planet and if if I'm talking with anybody about education it's like what do you know about AI and education have you heard of this guy Joe Lemon at Alpha and it it's it comes up so often which tells me that it is getting out there.

[01:59:35] It is this is no longer just that little niche school downtown Austin. I mean it's hard to believe what has happened in 5 years. It went from one building, one place to how many now? Right. So we have we're now uh we opened 12 campuses this we'll be at 25 alpha campuses. We also have 25 non-alpha campuses where back to lower price points. You know, we have we have campuses open where, you know, it's charter, so it's free for kids. We have ones where it's $5,000 pay for the parents, $500 a month, you know, some at 20,000. So, we're trying to figure out back to innovating. We're like, what are the right price points and everything, but yes, you know, we expect 12 months from now there to be hundreds and hundreds of schools that use this model. Um, you know, uh, you know, the the demand for the sports academy is through the roof. Um, uh, and we think that's going to explode for sure. >> Well, Joe, I appreciate you taking your time to come out today, but of course, more than anything, I just appreciate what you're doing. And, and again, I know this is, you know, not something that necessarily fits into what we talk about on this podcast, but again, I don't think you can care about >> medicine, science, health, and not care about the foundation upon which it's built. And it all starts with education.

[02:00:50] So, um, you're you're working on such an important problem. >> And if there's one last thing I can do since I've obviously had a great career obviously before this and three years ago moved to education. If there's other people out there and one of the things if you're listening to this and you're excited, part of my job is let's go get more talent into education and I can tell you the last three years have been awesome and my next 20 years is going to be better than my last 20 years. And so, you know, if I can if I can convince you to come on in the water, >> what's the best way for because I guarantee you there's a million people listening to us. There's going to be a nonzero number of them are going to want to reach out to you. What's the best way to get a hold of you? >> Great. Literally, my email, which is

[02:01:29] Joe.lemont.school and send it to me and you know, I am overloaded right now. To your point, the hype has gotten very high about Alpha. Um, >> what should they what could someone who wants to get your attention put in the subject line? Heard you on the heard you on the drive podcast or something. >> I heard you on the drive podcast, right?

[02:01:52] And, you know, we're looking for, you know, all sorts of people. One, >> you want product people, you want engineers, you want >> everybody wants to come in. We have to go build, you know, we're building AIs, right? There's back to expansion. We need entrepreneurs where, you know, GT school needs 500 schools. We need entrepreneurs who are going to go expand it like it's, you know, a Chipotle chain, right? We need AI guys, right?

[02:02:14] I'm going out Silicon Valley where we we have to, you know, current chat bots aren't good. We have to make the LLMs better. Um, we need people we need educators, right? People who are like, okay, I want to do this new thing. Um, if you're one of the learning scientists that we don't have on our team, right, come do it. Right? that is we're if you're back to capital we're going to need a lot of capital as well to expand this if back to philanthropy right it's we need to be giving scholarships we're funding a lot of it but we need to make this available to everybody right we have to your problem it can't just be for the elite it's got to be for a billion kids so education touches everything and if you're just in where you're like that description where of what they're building I'm in then come aboard because it's awesome

[02:03:02] Joe. Alpha.com. We'll link >> alpha.school. >> Alpha.school. Okay. We'll put that in the show notes just so that people can click directly on it. >> Um Joe, thanks again. Wonderful as always. >> This is great. [Music]

# 367 - Tylenol, pregnancy, and autism: What recent studies show and how to interpret the data

**Channel:** Peter Attia MD
**Upload Date:** 2025-10-06
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWVM_5knTXg
**Duration:** 90 minutes

## Description

In this special episode of The Drive, Peter addresses the recent headlines linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism in exposed children. Recognizing the confusion these claims have sparked among patients, listeners, and the broader public, Peter uses this episode to provide a framework for thinking critically about complex conditions and the research related to them. He highlights the dramatic rise in autism diagnoses over recent decades, noting that multifactorial conditions rarely have a single cause, and emphasizes the importance of resisting oversimplified explanations. Peter also stresses that humans are not naturally wired for scientific thinking, making disciplined frameworks like the Bradford Hill criteria essential for evaluating causality in epidemiology. Ultimately, he uses this framework to explore the evidence surrounding acetaminophen use during pregnancy and its potential link to autism.

## AI Summary

Here's a detailed summary of the video:

**Executive Summary**:
The video discusses the recent controversy surrounding the potential link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Dr. Peter Attia provides a comprehensive analysis of the available scientific evidence, examining both the statistical associations and the likelihood of causality. He emphasizes that while autism rates have increased dramatically over recent decades, this increase is largely explained by expanded diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, rather than a single cause like acetaminophen use.

**Key Points**:
- Autism rates have increased 5-fold from 2000 to 2020 [00:16:26]
- Genetics account for 80-90% of autism risk [01:03:15]
- Expanded diagnostic criteria explains 40-60% of increased autism rates [01:10:27]
- Increased awareness accounts for 20-30% of the increase [01:11:42]
- The association between acetaminophen and autism is weak (5% relative risk increase) [00:37:45]

**Detailed Insights**:
1. FDA Pregnancy Categories:
- Category A: No demonstrated risk (2-5% of drugs) [00:06:47]
- Category B: No evidence of risk in humans (15-25%) [00:07:33]
- Category C: Risk can't be ruled out (60-75%) [00:07:49]
- Category D: Evidence of human fetal risk (5-8%) [00:08:40]
- Category X: Proven significant harm (1-3%) [00:08:40]

2. Bradford Hill Criteria Analysis:
- Strength: Weak association [00:49:32]
- Consistency: Moderate [00:52:19]
- Specificity: Weak [00:53:36]
- Temporality: Modest to strong [00:54:14]
- Biological gradient: Moderate [00:55:16]

**References & Resources**:
1. BMC Environmental Health systematic review (August 2023) [00:23:22]
2. Swedish cohort study (2.5 million children) [00:34:35]
3. Japanese cohort study (220,000 children) [00:43:36]
4. Bradford Hill criteria (1965) [00:48:00]
5. CDC autism prevalence data [00:16:26]

**Action Items**:
1. For minor aches and pains, consider avoiding acetaminophen during pregnancy [01:29:55]
2. For fever reduction during pregnancy, acetaminophen use is likely beneficial [01:25:09]
3. Consult with healthcare provider about individual risk-benefit analysis [01:21:49]
4. Consider other modifiable risk factors like maternal health and environmental exposures [01:19:02]
5. Develop critical thinking skills to evaluate scientific claims independently [01:28:00]

[00:00:00] Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia. [Music] Welcome to a special episode of The Drive, everyone. If you've been uh following the headlines recently, you may have seen, of course, stories linking acetammenophen or Tylenol um use during pregnancy to autism. And not surprisingly, those headlines have generated a lot of questions, a lot of controversy, and a lot of confusion. Um,

[00:00:30] I've heard about this a lot from Every Direction, my patients, listeners of the podcast, friends, family members, people writing in through the website. Uh, basically, it's I mean, like I'm sure many people in the space, we've all been inundated by it. And, you know, the more I thought about it, the more I realized um this was a great opportunity to um I think maybe put forth a framework for how to think about these things critically. And while we initially thought we would just do this in the newsletter last week, once we got into it, we realized now this doesn't really lend itself to a an article uh or even a short uh video, it really commands effectively the the discipline of what we do in the AMAs, the ask me anything.

[00:01:13] Of course, uh unlike the normal AMAs, this is going to be made available to everybody. So before we dive in though, I want to kind of lay out some groundwork. Um, we're going to unpack some of the points in more detail that I'm going to lay out below. Um, but I also want to make sure we're starting from a a place of reference. I want to start out with a few important observations. Okay. So, the first is autism rates have risen dramatically over the past generation. Now, we're going to talk about why that might be, but it's very important to state up front that there is uh unlikely to be a single cause. Why? because complex conditions usually don't have simple explanations. This is true of obesity uh despite what some people would have you believe that it's just this one thing or just this one thing and you know whatever. But but the reality of it is complex conditions require uh uh multiple things typically. So anytime we look at a possible contributing factor, we need to kind of resist the temptation to assume it's the sole cause. Now that doesn't diminish the interest in identifying a bunch of potential causes.

[00:02:17] Okay, second point I want to make here, and it's kind of weird that I have to make it, but I do. Science is supposed to be apolitical. Uh, unfortunately, that's not the case. Uh, and for reasons that I I don't think I'm smart enough to understand, autism happens to be one of those examples. But so are many other topics we've discussed like nutrition or protein, which has become remarkably political. My goal here is not to have a political debate uh but rather to examine the evidence uh as carefully and objectively as I can. Uh third, we do need to realize something that I think is very hard to accept. Uh and that is that as humans, we are not wired to think scientifically. I want to restate that because it sounds condescending, but it's simply an observation of how we have evolved. We are not wired for critical and scientific thought. Um, this is something I've written about and we're going to actually link to a piece

[00:03:15] I wrote over 10 years ago that I think synthesizes that point really well. Um, but again, it really comes down to the fact that we should understand that the scientific method and critical thought are human inventions. They're wonderful inventions and I would argue they are the single most important invention our species has ever put forth. And without this, nothing else would exist. We'd still be living in caves. So, um, but that doesn't mean that it comes naturally and it doesn't mean we're wired to do it. So, just keep that in mind as you catch yourself, as I catch myself falling into nonscientific thought. Um we're going to rely on a framework at some point during this discussion um which is very helpful when considering epidemiology which is the branch of science we're going to be talking primarily about today and it's called the Bradford Hill criteria. These are nine principles that were laid out in the mid60s to help us determine whether an observed observation is likely to be causal. Um, so, so this framework looks at things like strength of association, consistency across multiple studies, biologic plausibility, temporality, and things like that.

[00:04:27] They're not a checklist per se, but they provide a disciplined way to try to make sense of correlations and interpret which ones have a higher probability of being causal from those that don't. Um, another thing I want to point out is we're going to be talking about medications. We're going to be talking about pregnancy. And um, I think it should be obvious and I'm sure anyone listening to this or watching this who has gone through pregnancy will understand um, that the bar is very high when we are talking about medications to be used uh, during pregnancy. Most physicians, myself included, though I don't treat very many pregnant women, think about drugs and supplements very differently in the setting of pregnancy.

[00:05:11] Of course, because we are typically not treating patients with life-threatening conditions, our mantra is during pregnancy, women should basically stop all medications and supplements beyond the obvious ones such as prenatal vitamins or hormones such as thyroid hormone, which can be essential. But anything that's even in a gray area or probably okay, we tend to just avoid.

[00:05:34] Now, since the late '7s, the FDA has used a very simple letter system to classify drugs by their risk during pregnancy. These categories go by A, B, C, D, and X. And basically each letter refers to um a level of evidence mostly from animal and human studies about the potential harm of the drug to the fetus.

[00:05:58] So for more than I don't know 35 years or so this was the framework physicians relied on about 10 years ago the FDA replaced it what is um by a by a framework that is called the pregnancy and lactation labeling rule or the PLLR. The idea was to move away from single letters and instead provide a more descriptive guidance. Um, and in theory that's an improvement, but in practice it's been kind of slow to roll out. And frankly, I'm a little guilty of generally thinking about it in the ABC

[00:06:29] DX category. And that's kind of what I'm going to refer to a little bit. So, I'm going to stick with that older category. And while it's imperfect, it's widely understood. It is still a clear framework. Um and I just want to share with you as we begin this so you have a broad sense of how drugs fit into this.

[00:06:47] Okay. So category A means that there is no demonstrated risk in wellont controlled human studies. Uh again that's that's pretty unusual uh because that's a hard thing to do and that's reflected in the proportion of total drugs and supplements out there that fit in this category and it's somewhere between 2 and 5%. Okay. So what does that mean? And that means that is completely safe. We have definitive evidence that women can take these things during pregnancy and obviously as reflected by the numbers virtually nothing fits in that category. Uh by the way the examples I gave earlier uh of of thyroid hormone and prenatal vitamins do fit in that category. Then you have category B which says there's no evidence of risk in humans but animal data might show signals in some studies.

[00:07:33] Um, and so these are generally thought of as safe, but exercise caution, basically. And this is 15 to 25%. Then you have category C. This is the biggest one. This says risk can't be ruled out. We don't have evidence that there's risk, but we don't have evidence that it's safe. And most drugs sit here.

[00:07:49] It's a big range somewhere between 60 and 75%. Category D says actually we do have some positive evidence of human fetal risk. And the drugs that sit in this category, and I'm going to come back to this and give you examples of each of the drugs, the drugs that sit in this category, you might say, well, why would a woman ever take a drug if there's some evidence of risk to the fetus? And that is only if the risk to the mother not taking it is greater. So the classic example here are seizure medications. So if you have a a woman who is going to be debilitated by seizures and this is the only treatment she can have, then a physician will typ typically make that that decision. And again, very few drugs fit in this category. It's typically 5 to 8%. And you have category X which are drugs that have definitively been proven as much as you can prove anything in biology to cause significant harm to the fetus um uh regardless of benefit to the mother.

[00:08:40] And again these are these are pretty rare and this is sort of one to 3%. So again just keep in mind now where does Tylenol or acetaminophen fit into that? Well it fits into category B. Um, and to be clear, for the last 10 years, there has been some concern about does Tylenol belong in category B? Should it belong in category C? Um, the other thing to keep in mind with Tylenol is you always have to ask yourself about the uh the switching cost or uh the alternative choices. And of course, a very common alternative choice for Tylenol uh would be something like ibuprofen or an NSAID.

[00:09:18] Now ibuprofen uh Advil alie for example are considered category B in the first two trimesters but bump to category D in the third trimester for reasons I don't necessarily need to get into but for those who are interested it has to do with the premature closing closure of a very small blood vessel that connects the aorta and the uh pulmonary artery and if that closes prematurely it leads to premature delivery and all sorts of things like that. So anyway, I just want you to kind of keep in mind why these categories exist. And the reason we're walking through all of this now is to just sort of set the stage um uh to to for this discussion. So the goal today is not just to look um at the potential link between acetammen and autism, but also to put it in context so that we can hopefully end with I think the question that at least some of you are asking, which is okay, science aside, Peter, what's the bottom line? if a woman is pregnant, should she be taking Tylenol?

[00:10:18] And I'm going to resist the urge to just give you that answer right now because I think it undermines the process of thought. So, of course, to answer that question, you have to not only take into account the possible effect of Tylenol exposure on the baby, but also the health and the well-being of the mother. um and also the possible effects of going without Tylenol in the case of fever or inflammation, which is also associated with negative health outcomes for babies that are exposed to those conditions in uterero. Um we're going to take the same structured approach um that I basically try to recommend and utilize anytime I've confronted with an association between exposure X and condition Y. And that's true if condition Y is positive or negative, good or bad. Um, so I want to lay this out right now so that you know what we're going to do and how we're going to land this plane. The first thing you want to be able to do is confirm that there is indeed an association statistically. Okay? So, you know, a lot of times people say there's an association, but there might actually not be. So, you you actually want to document that statistically there is uh an exposure. So, you want to verify that. The second question you're asking is, and of course this is the hardest one, is uh because that one the first one's pretty easy. Um if there is a statistical association, you want to determine the likelihood that the association is causal. Uh now included in this would be sensitivity analyses, falsification tests, and things of that nature. Now, notice I said you're not trying to prove if the association is causal. Why? Because, as I'm sure many of you have heard me say before, there are no proofs in biology. Uh it's not it's not like mathematics. You don't get to write QED at the end of your work.

[00:11:58] Here what we're really dealing with here is probabilities and we're trying to determine the likelihood of causality. Now if the association is believed to be more likely causal than not, then we have to ask the final question which factors into what do you do which is we have to understand the effect size. So you could have things that are causal but the effect size is so small that it doesn't matter in which case you know your your behavior is going to be quite different. Um so final point before kind of jumping into this it's very important to remember that we um we're discussing the state of science today and science is not about being right or wrong in an absolute sense. It's really about constantly updating our priors, understanding um the probability of something as new evidence becomes uh becomes emergent and that's how we should really work. So as more and more data uh come online, we might have to revise whatever views uh and conclusions

[00:12:57] I've come to here. Uh doing so is not a weakness although tragically it has become viewed as a weakness, right? Um you know certainly if politicians change their mind about things that's viewed as waffling. Um but as as as scientists or as communicators of science, we we shouldn't be afraid of that. We should be open and acknowledge that as of today, this might be how we view things and in the presence of new information, uh we we should be very receptive to changing that mind. So, I know that was a lot of background, normally far more than I would uh at the outset of a podcast, but I think it's really important to have a shared foundation of knowledge um and an understanding of the framework before we wade into a topic that is not only scientifically uh complex, but obviously very emotionally and politically charged. That's the lens

[00:13:43] I'm hoping to use for this discussion. Um, now with all of that said, I thought rather than just continue a monologue, it would be great to have uh my co-host Nick Stson from the AMAs join me um and basically lay out this discussion with me in the form of a Q&A such that it really reflects questions we're hearing and um creates a bit of a storyline through this. So, uh Nick, thanks very much for joining me on very short notice. Peter, I think as we get started, it would be helpful first to just even look at and lay the foundation of what exactly are the claims being made about acetame and autism. So the basic gist of the scientific claim is that maternal use of acetamophen during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism uh in the exposed child. And this has prompted the government to respond by asking the FDA to issue warnings to physicians and change the labels on acetaminophen products with obviously Tylenol being the most common and the most familiar to reflect the possible risk during pregnancy. But it's important to note that both the FDA and the scientific community agree that we don't yet have evidence to assert that the apparent correlations between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and autism risk reflect a causal relationship. In other words, no authoritative sources are claiming that we can conclude from the existing body of evidence that a cena actually causes an increase in autism risk. Though some argue that a causal relationship is plausible and others argue that a causal relationship is very likely and that acetamin should therefore be avoided during pregnancy um or used uh at most with strong precaution. And you mentioned at the offset that there could be a lot of reasons why we're seeing autism rates increase and not just a single thing.

[00:15:37] What do we know about why there are so many things being linked to autism these days? So actually there's two parts to your question, Nick. Um because on the one hand you're asking me why are autism rates going up? Because that's uh we we can't deny that like that that's you know that's sort of like saying is the sun coming up every morning? Um, but your second question is, uh, why are there so many things being linked to it these days? So, I'm going to answer that question first because I think that's the more jugular question at the moment.

[00:16:05] And and I I promise I will get to that second question. So, why are so many things being linked to the enormous uptick in autism these days and it really comes down to a very very understandable, rational, and logical desire, which is a very strong motivation to look for the triggers of autism. We are looking for culprits.

[00:16:26] Okay. So, autism rates have risen dramatically um both nationally and even globally over the past few decades. So, according to the CDC, the prevalence of autism increased from 6.7 cases per thousand children in the year 2000 just 25 years ago to 32.2 cases per thousand children just 3 years ago. That's a fivefold increase. And again, while some of that increase is due to an expanding diagnostic uh definition and increased awareness, which we'll get into more later, as I said, um there is no doubt that some residual increase even after accounting for these changes uh is out there. And therefore, in an effort to find these potential causes, a lot of research has been done to find potential associations between autism and countless other variables.

[00:17:18] Now, all of that sounds great and all of that makes sense, but it poses a significant statistical problem. And this is known as the multiple comparisons problem. If you look at enough variables, you are bound to find statistically significant associations. Now, again, this is this is the first example that I'm going to pull forth from what I stated at the outset, which is we are not wired to think scientifically. If anybody out there thinks they are smart enough that they can understand P values out of the womb, more power to you. And you know, I majored in mathematics. I spent my life doing math and stats. This idea is not that intuitive until it is explained to you. So, it's understandable why what

[00:18:03] I'm about to say doesn't necessarily jump to your mind as the explanation for this. Now, let me use an example. Imagine if you're trying to detect if someone has psychic powers by having them guess the outcome of coin flips. So you you guess uh or you you create the rule such that if they guess correctly on at least seven out of 10 flips, which by the way that's a 5% chance somebody would do that based on pure luck with a fair coin, right? So, if I had a fair coin and I flipped it 10 times, each of those has a 50/50 shot of heads or tails. But if you can guess correctly seven out of 10, 8 out of 10, 9 out of 10, or 10 out of 10, there's only a 5% chance of doing that. I'm going to declare you a psychic. So, that that game is basically like a single hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.5. So, you see where I'm going with this, right? This is now I'm setting this up like a single hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05 05 or a p value of 0.05.

[00:19:08] Now suppose instead of just testing one person, I'm going to test a hundred random people all with fair coins. And let's of course just assume for the purpose of illustration there are no real psychics. I realize there's going to be a little hatred directed toward me from people who believe they're psychics. Well, by chance alone, I'm going to identify five people out of a hundred who are going to pass the psychic test, and they're going to look like psychics. But the probability that at least one person passes the test isn't just 5%, it's much higher because randomness can hit anywhere across that group. So if you keep scaling this up to thousands of tests, like scanning genes for diseases and links and running marketing experiments, I mean, anytime you're running massive amounts of experiments, the odds of finding at least one false hit approach near certainty. So, you're essentially trolling through noise until patterns emerge by accident, like seeing faces in clouds or winning a lottery if you buy enough tickets. There's a great website um called Spurious Correlations. I I

[00:20:15] I've been playing with this website for a long time and went back to it recently that shares examples of how easy it is to find significant correlations, even very strong correlations, between variables that clearly have nothing to do with each other, provided you're willing to look at enough different combinations of variables. So, for example, one very silly one is a 98.5% correlation between the per capita consumption of margarine and the divorce rate in Maine. uh one of my personal favorites. If you look at the number of physicists in the state of California and the ranking of

[00:20:55] Michael Schumacher when he was driving in F1 between the year 2003 and 2012, the correlation was 0.971, 97.1%. But what's most interesting about this is that the site also demonstrates how easy it is to come up with plausible sounding stories for why two clearly unrelated variables might be related. So they ask AI to come up with a train of logic linking the variables. So if if you consider the example of the

[00:21:28] California physicists and Michael Schumacher's success, AI explains that by saying that the rising number of physicists in California drive innovation in the automotive industry, which leads to faster and more effective race cars that propelled Michael Schumacher to higher rankings, which of course is ridiculous. And so, Peter, what do we know about why these ideas about associations with autism tend to persist even if the evidence can be shaky?

[00:21:57] I think it comes down to the fact that it is literally impossible to disprove the link between any variable and autism. The way that you can disprove other things such as the earth being flat uh or even things that are really complicated like rveratrol extending mamalian life where you have the luxury of doing randomized controlled experiment after randomized controlled experiment after randomized controlled experiment all of which fail. you have such a high degree of probability that you've effectively disproved it. But we can't do that in epidemiology and and I think that's why these ideas uh persist.

[00:22:34] And Peter, kind of going back to the recent news, what do we know about? Was there anything in particular that triggered the recent concern around acettophen and autism? Not really other than a publication that we'll talk about, but the idea that autism might be linked to prenatal acetammenophen exposure isn't new. A handful of studies have reported very small associations between that exposure and outcome over the past decade, more or less. Um but the recent alarm was triggered by uh a systematic review um of earlier research which was published in late August in a journal called BMC environmental health. Now importantly and I was a little surprised to see this this publication was not a metaanalysis.

[00:23:22] So they didn't pull the data from the studies to re-evaluate the overall association or perform any new statistical tests. Uh the authors of this paper just collected all the relevant studies they could find on the relationship between prenatal acettomenophan exposure and the risk of autism. Uh they also looked at ADHD and some other neurodedevelopmental disorders um in non-over overlapping human cohorts and they shared the basic study details uh and results in one place and added some additional commentary. So basically you can think of it as sort of a review article.

[00:23:52] And so I think now it would be just helpful to just break down this paper in more detail for people. So let's start with what did the paper show? Yeah. So in the case of autism, there were six observational studies that met their criteria for inclusion and the authors reported that these six studies quote consistently reported a positive association between prenatal acettomenophen use and ASD autism uh spectrum disorder with an exposure response relationship observed in four of the five studies that evaluated the relationship.

[00:24:25] But this isn't actually true. Um, in actuality, two of the six studies showed no significant association between use of acetaminophen uh use during pregnancy and the risk of autism in the offspring. And only three of the included studies directly examined the potential dose response relationship. while the fourth uh by authors Xi uh and and others attempted to assess dose dividing the participants into tertiles uh groups of thirds based on acetaminophen detected in a single blood test. uh this method, you know, kind of had the advantage of using a quantitative biioarker instead of uh potentially biased patient questionnaers that try to get at recall.

[00:25:07] But since the measurement was based on just one sample taken during birth, it's a very poor indicator of overall exposure during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is almost completely eliminated from the body within 24 hours. So all the blood tests from the Xi study really tell us is whether or not a woman happened to take Tylenol in the 24 hours leading up to delivery. Of course, a woman who had none before delivery might have taken

[00:25:35] Tylenol for weeks on end earlier in her pregnancy. Or a woman could have taken Tylenol with delivery could have had none up until that point. So again, uh it's an interesting study, the Xi study, which we're going to look at all of them in a moment, but I just want to point out that most of these studies rely on questionnaers, um and this study attempted to look at this biioarker, but obviously it it has significant limitations.

[00:25:59] Another point I'd say is that in the largest study examining a dose response relationship, uh this was a study by lead author uh Alkfest who the senior author on that was Lee and I'm going to come back to that in a second because uh Dr. Lee was interviewed this week uh by JAMAMA. Um the dose response was only present in a partially adjusted statistical model where it disappeared in what was called the fully adjusted model. And I'll talk about this in a little bit more uh in a moment so you understand what I mean. But this suggests that the dose dependent association between acetto menophen and autism which is actually very important was actually due to confounding variables that weren't accounted for in the partially adjusted model but were accounted for in the fully adjusted model. So to take a look at this, I want you to look at the figure uh sitting next to my head here, which is um an analysis that my team pulled together by plotting the risk ratios from the studies included in this analysis. Now this this paper I was I was surprised that this figure was not in the paper because almost all review articles would do this and certainly a meta analysis would have, but nevertheless uh they didn't and so we we've done this and you can feel free to check us if you like. um but we've taken all of the data out of their tables and simply put them into a poolled uh table and then the one thing we did at the end was pool it. So that's what's shown in red here. So let me just orient you to this figure. So you've got all the names of the studies here. So you've got and by the way the alka study is referred to as the Swedish study. So you've got at the very top you've got the pulled or um sorry the sibling controlled version of the

[00:27:44] Swedish study followed by the full cohort of the Swedish study followed by a set of other studies and then the Xi you're seeing two versions of this. You're seeing the third tertile compared to the first tertile and the second tertile compared to the first tertile. You then have a couple of these other studies and then you can see the summary in red is where we're showing the pool data. Now, let me remind you how to interpret these lines and bars and things like that. The unity line represents absolutely no risk. Anything to the right of the unity line would represent an increase in risk. Anything to the left of the unity line would represent a decrease in risk. And the bars represent the 95% confidence intervals. In an ideal world, you're looking to see dots that would be quite far from the unity line one way or the other. Peter, can you walk people through what this chart is showing us?

[00:28:36] Because one, a lot of people haven't looked at or interpreted charts like this before, and two, we also have people listening, not watching. So for those people, this will be in the show notes, which will be available to all as well. But can you walk through what the big insights that you and the team had from this chart? In this chart, you can see that the overall association between acetammenophen use and autism is very small, corresponding to um just a 5% increase in relative risk between exposed and unexposed children. But there are a few other details that jump out at you when you're looking at this.

[00:29:11] So the most obvious feature, at least to me, is that there is a very strong association coming from one very small study. In fact, the smallest study here, which is the Xi study from 2020. Um, but as discussed a minute ago, this study was done very different from the others. So, instead of comparing the risk between children who were versus were not exposed to acetaminophen during gestation. So, they then just divided the participants into three groups or tertiles based on the concentration of acetaminophen that was detected in the samples of umbilical cord blood. So then you could compare the risk in the first to the second and the first to the third tertiles respectively. So again this might eliminate the issue of recall bias um which of course is a real issue as well where you have to ask a woman after she has the baby you know how much

[00:30:07] Tylenol did you take during your pregnancy when etc. Um but again it still has a pretty big issue which is acetaminophen does not stick around very long in the blood. Um, and therefore we don't really know how much the acetaminophen levels identified in cord blood at the time of delivery really tell us anything about the amount of acetaminophen that the woman took during pregnancy. Now, some have pointed out that this isn't a concern since a study published this past January by another group um reported a positive correlation between three levels of self-reported acetaminophen use throughout pregnancy.

[00:30:46] So they called it non-use less than 14 days or more than 14 days and the level of acetaminophen detected in cord blood at birth. However, the correlation was not that great. It was 72% and involved a completely distinct cohort. So there's certainly a lot of room for error based on that. Additionally, the XI study mentions that all cord blood samples contained detectable levels of acetammenophen, but they don't actually report how those levels differed across the tertiles, either averages or thresholds. So, we have no idea how much acetaminophen we're actually talking about here. However, they do report that 70% of the samples had no detectable levels of acetamin metabolites, which would strongly suggest that the majority of participants had very minimal levels of acetaminophen exposure, such as what you might see, you know, through drinking water. This essentially means that the comparison between the second and first tiles was comparing sub therapeutic exposure to sub therapeutic exposure, telling us virtually nothing.

[00:31:51] And as further evidence of this, that paper I just referenced that looked at um comparing cord blood levels to recall, remember it divided them into nothing uh up to 14 days, more than 14 days. Um it found acetammenophen in all cord blood samples, yet it showed that tertiles one and two were statistically identical.

[00:32:12] Again, the suggestion here is there's some low level of hermetic Tylenol or Tylenol metabolite that we're probably all exposed to that doesn't really constitute an exposure. Another issue, and I actually think this is the single biggest issue, by the way, seems to be the biased participant inclusion. So, the participants in the G study were enrolled in 1998 and followed for another 20 years, and anybody who dropped out before the end of that 20-year mark was excluded. But think about that for a moment. People are more likely to stay in an extended longitudinal study if they have a personal interest in the results. For instance, if they find their child has autism. This is likely to affect the studies on this subject. But it seems especially pronounced in the Xi paper um as this study which was based in the US reported rates of autism in the participants at roughly 11%.

[00:33:10] So meaning when you look at all of the participants who completed that study, 11% of the kids had autism. But for context, the general population currently at that 5x increase is 3%. And at the time of enrollment, it was 7%. The enrollment was between 98 and 2004. Um the cohort used by the Xi study was called the Boston birth cohort which u originally enrolled nearly 9,000 mother child pairs but among them pre-term births were quite over represented uh over 35%.

[00:33:48] By 2018 approximately 3,000 DIADs remained in the active uh follow-up cohort presumably due to um loss on follow-up. And of those eligible diads, slightly less than a thousand had available umbilical cord plasma samples and complete outcome data. So again, we have kind of a concentration it would seem of cases due to all the reasons I just stated. But one of the most important things to take away from this graph is the fact that the risk estimate summarized from all the studies, what we're sort of calling the poolled one here in red, is virtually identical to the risk estimate derived solely from the 2024 alkist study, which was done in

[00:34:35] Sweden. And so it's commonly referred to, and you've probably heard of it referred to this way as the Swedish cohort study. And the reason they're essentially identical is that that Swedish study included more than 10 times the number of participants than all other studies combined. I know that's a lot there. I think it's actually worth just summarizing that again before we move on to the Swedish study because I if you looked at this this graph that we put together, you could very easily come to the conclusion that the the Xi study is indeed the smoking gun. But again, you have to remember the limitations of this and there are several, right? One is the sample size is incredibly small relative to the others. too. You have the concentration effect where based on the nature of the study, you concentrated and disproportionately counted cases of autism versus non. And then of course you have the collection methods where um using this single sample of cord blood uh which may have some association with maternal use during pregnancy but is very unlikely to account for the actual nuanced differences in dose and exposure during pregnancy. Again think about that through the lens of any other thing. If

[00:35:43] I if I could only measure how many donuts you ate on your birthday, it would be very difficult for me to impute how many donuts you eat over the course of a year. Would it have a correlation? Probably. But it wouldn't be strong enough to take to the bank if I was trying to use doughnut consumption uh as a as a marker of predicting heart disease. So again, it's very tempting when you look at these uh meta analyses or in this case even just a review article to think more is better. But remember, a thousand SARS makes not a pearl necklace. Quoting the great James

[00:36:16] Yang who uh used to be one of my mentors in the lab. Given how big the Swedish cohort study was, I do think it's worth spending some time to really break that down. So, can you walk people through that study and what it found in more detail? Yeah, the Swedish study was a very large uh prospective cohort study and the general results indicate a small correlation between emitt acettomenophen use in in uh by the mother during pregnancy and later life ASD in the offspring. So there were just under 2 and a half million Swedish children included in the full cohort and the primary exposure metric was ever use of acetaminophen in pregnancy with dose serving as a secondary metric. So again the primary outcome is binary either you ever used acetaminophen or you did not.

[00:37:04] So acetaminophen use was determined through a combination of prescriptions uh because again single health care system so they they have access to all the prescriptions um and also through maternal uh interview with midwife or physician throughout the pregnancy. Uh they don't specify the number of interviews uh and it probably varied across participants. So over a median follow-up of about 13 1/2 years, the general cohort showed a very small but statistically significant positive association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and autism. The hazard ratio is 1.05 and the confidence interval was 1.02 to 1.08.

[00:37:45] So what does that mean? That means it showed a 5% increase in relative risk. Um and the confidence interval of 95% confidence was significant because it did not cross the unity line. So anytime the error bars do not cross the unity line, it's statistically significant. Um remember just going back to the um studying study stuff we tal about, we always like to calculate an absolute risk exposure if we can. So the relative risk was a 5% increase. The absolute risk increase was 0.09% 09% increase at 10 years. So that's a that's a very small absolute risk increase less than onetenth of 1%.

[00:38:29] Um so the researchers then examined risk specifically in a cohort subset that was composed of matched sets of full biologic siblings. So the authors examined sibling pairs that were discordant in acetaminophen exposure and found no significant difference in risk for autism between exposure and lack of exposure. So why do this? The logic here is similar to any matched cohort study, but instead of merely matching based on general characteristics like age or sex, each exposed individual is matched to an unexposed sibling. This means that exposed and unexposed groups on the whole should be relatively evenly matched in terms of several confounding variables related to home environment and even many genetic factors. each person in one group could be mirrored by somebody in the control group. So there shouldn't be any systematic differences between the groups.

[00:39:31] Can you walk people through what happened when they did the more detailed sibling analysis? Yeah. So when they did that concordant discordant analysis, the correlation was entirely abolished. Um when they compared and controlled for family environment and genetics as best as you could. Remember this was not an an identical twin comparison. it was just siblings. Um, but obviously this is the best control you could get and this suggests that the apparent link observed in the full cohort was likely due to confounding factors. Given these results, the authors of the Swedish study came to the same conclusion and they stated, quote, "Results of this study indicate that the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodedevelopmental disorders is a non-causal association.

[00:40:23] Associations observed in models without sibling control may be attributable to confounding." Now, it's important to note that the review article that came out in August in their analysis, they state that the Swedish study only included siblings that were discordant for both exposure and outcome. But this was not the case according to the Swedish study's senior author. And such a design would introduce what's known as a collider bias where the selection criteria create a situation where the exposure and outcome are already related in some way.

[00:41:05] To illustrate why this double discordance selection doesn't work, consider a very extreme example. Imagine autism can only occur with acetaminophen exposure, but that acetaminophen exposure does not guarantee autism. So in biological parlance we would say acetammenophen is necessary but not sufficient.

[00:41:27] If you select only pairs that are discordant for both the exposure and the outcome, you would exclude all cases in which acetaminophen exposure did not result in autism even if those sibling pairs accounted for the majority of sibling pairs discordant for the exposure. In other words, you would falsely conclude 100% risk. Therefore, I believe that Lee, the senior author of the Swedish study, is correct in his assessment, which is that once you correct for genetics and home environmental exposures, the risk of autism as it pertains to acetaminophen exposure is not causal. stated another way, um, acetaminophen exposure prenatally in the Swedish cohort does not appear to be causally related to autism. Looking at what you just looked at, is there any reason to question those results and question what that study said? Another way to think about it is, do people who argue in favor of a potential link between acetime and autism have anything to say about those results?

[00:42:40] Yes, you should question everything. So I would say that the one of the criticisms that's been leveled against the Swedish study is that the overall rates of acet acetaminophen use in that study were much lower than are observed here in the US or elsewhere in the world. only about 7 and a half% of the participating mothers in the Swedish study uh were consumers of acetaminophen whereas some studies have reported up to 50% of mothers using acetaminophen during pregnancy and again given this discrepancy some have argued that the generalizability of the Swedish study is limited which is interesting and as it happens you couldn't make this up another large cohort study um with a similar nested sibling analysis was just published a couple of weeks ago. This was after the

[00:43:36] August publication of the review article and it supports the findings of the Swedish study. The new study was conducted in a nationwide Japanese population and consisted of almost 220,000 children of which almost 40% were exposed to acetaminophen during gestation. So very similar to the rates we see in the United States and in some of the other high exposure studies. The associations reported from this Japanese cohort were similar to those in the

[00:44:11] Swedish study. In the general cohort, so unadjusting for siblings, prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with a 6% uptick in autism rates. Recall in the Swedish study, it was 5%. But in the Japanese study, this did not reach statistical significance. So the co the confidence interval the 95% confidence interval crossed the unity line it was 0.98 to 1.15.

[00:44:38] But when they did the sibling analysis even this small trend towards an increased risk was completely abolished. So when you take this Japanese study of nearly 220,000 children and pair it with the Swedish study of 2 and a half million children and both of them when done by this method abolish any causality. It's very difficult to make a strong case for causality. We've talked about this before but I think anytime we're this deep in a science it's good for people to kind of step back. And so can you walk people through why it's so hard to make assumptions about causality based on just observational data?

[00:45:22] Yes. I mean again I think you can think back to the sort of spurious correlation site that I was talking about earlier. Um it really comes down to the potential influence of confounding variables that we are blind to. That's basically what it comes down to. Um Dr. Lee, the senior author of the Swedish paper, was interviewed by JAMAMA this week. Uh, it's a great interview. I think it's worth reading. We'll link to it. He talks about a a great example that I'm sure many people have heard.

[00:45:53] I'd certainly heard it before in a statistics class, but it's worth repeating. It's the example of the strong correlation between ice cream consumption and drowning. Um, so as we see rates of ice cream uh consumption go up, we see drowning deaths go up. And as one falls, the other falls. And obviously, if you were being, you know, sort of cheeky, you would say somehow eating ice cream is causing people to drown. But of course, there's a confounding variable. And the confounding variable is heat. The warmer it gets, the more people are likely to eat ice cream, and separately, the more people are likely to swim. And therefore, it's this confounding variable that isn't immediately obvious that explains both of these things.

[00:46:42] And I think that's really the challenge of epidemiology. And I don't say that as a knock on epidemiology. I say it's the legitimate challenge. It's that you can never ever ever identify all of the confounders. And therefore, you are always at the mercy of wondering, is there something I'm not seeing here? that is what is actually explaining the causality. So like the only way to show causation unfortunately is through randomized trials. That's the only way you can really be as close to 100% sure that you've established causality by doing a well-controlled randomized control trial. But unfortunately some questions do not lend themselves to that for either ethical or logistical reasons. And clearly this question the use of acetaminophen and autism is one of those tricky questions. So, we're not going to get an RCT to do this. Um, and instead we're going to have to glean what we can as best we can from epidemiology.

[00:47:39] Um, and that's where I think we get to uh this set of guidelines that I talked about at the top of the u the top of the show here called the Bradford Hill criteria. So, the Bradford Hill criteria are a set of nine principles used to assess whether an observed association is likely to reflect a true causal relationship. So, Sir Austin Bradford

[00:48:00] Hill in 1965 put forth these criteria to help epidemiologic uh researchers examine their data when RCTs were not available. So, they consider factors like strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient, biological plausibility, coherence, experimental evidence, and analogy. So Peter, I think what would be helpful now is let's just go through the state of the evidence for each of those criteria. So looking at acetamophen and autism, what's first on the list? Yeah. So let's just start with strength. How large is the effect? And the larger the effect, the more likely it is to be causal. Again, we can talk about a few obvious and famous examples.

[00:48:46] The example of smoking is perhaps most notable. Right? there. I I I'm not aware I've never met a person who doesn't uh understand or disputes the exposure relationship between cigarette smoke and lung cancer. Like that's there's nobody out there making the case that we need an RCT to determine that. We don't have an RCT.

[00:49:05] And why is it? It's because if you run the smoking through the uh smoking lung cancer uh data through the Bradford Hill criteria, it it pops on many levels, but effect size is probably the biggest. We're talking about an effect size of uh 10x, right? So 10 x is is just a magnitude beyond what we normally would find in most biologic associations. By comparison, the effect size here is 1.05x.

[00:49:32] That's what a 5% relative risk increase is. So this is smaller than associations that have been reported for many other things that we actually know are probably almost assuredly not causal. um based on more wellto-do data such as the association between red meat consumption and type 2 diabetes which is a 1.10 or a 10% relative risk increase per 100 gram per day increase in red meat. Of course, we've argued at nauseium that those associations are almost assuredly picking up a confounder which is healthy user bias uh or even poultry consumption in the risk of type 2 diabetes 1.08.

[00:50:15] Again, both of these are stronger associations here. Um, an even clearer example um would be the metaanalysis of observational studies that reported that a higher uh leisure time physical activity was linked to a 5% higher increase in prostate cancer. Again, we know that that is completely nonsensical. Um, but that is what you get when you go trolling for signal in a sea of noise. you will eventually find it. In other words, for this, the effect size is very weak. When the effect size is weak, and here we're defining weak um as a subset of the type of epidemiology we're looking at. And in this case, we're looking at pharmicopidemiology versus say nutritional epidemiology or toxicology epidemiology. Uh weak is generally regarded as 1.5 for pharmaccoepidemiology. And the reason for it is just based on the uh pervasiveness of bias throughout these studies. So when you're showing up at 1.05 and the threshold for interesting is 1.5, you're well below it. I would say that you know we don't do very well on the strength here.

[00:51:26] Moving on to the next piece of the criteria, consistency. How consistent are the data linking autism and acetaphen? I would say actually they're reasonably consistent, right? So consistency obviously just means how often does this show up across multiple studies and maybe even across multiple populations and different methodologies. Um and I would say a handful of prospective cohort studies have reported this positive association. Um but remember these associations tend to go away when you control for family environment or genetics as we've seen in the two largest studies here uh that we've talked about. So in general population studies i.e. no sibling control. The reported associations have varied somewhat in magnitude. Um uh but you know some have shown little to no association. Uh I would say more often there is some association.

[00:52:19] Moving on to specificity. What do we know about specificity? Yeah. So specificity is asking the question basically how specific is the cause effect relationship? So if an exposure is um associated with only one outcome or an outcome associated with only one exposure, a causal relationship is is more likely. Um so so here it's very non-specific, right? Because there are many variables that have been linked to autism risk, many with much stronger lines of evidence than acetaminophen. for example, advanced um paternal age, premature birth, air pollution exposure, and heavy metal exposure. So, these are all variables that have much stronger associations with autism. So, we're not dealing with a one versus one. And some lack of specificity also exists in the other direction. Right? There's observational studies that have also reported associations between acetaminophen use and ADHD and language development. So again, um what what you really want to look for if you want to check the specificity box is a onetoone mapping. Again, it's not a dealbreaker not to have it, right? Cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer and other cancer and heart disease, and that doesn't necessarily by itself at all diminish the fact that it causes lung cancer.

[00:53:36] Peter, moving next on the list, we have temporality. Does the exposure precede the reported effects in this case? It does. Um and certainly to a first order it does meaning acetaminophen use comes before autism. Um but there really hasn't been a consensus on the impact of timing of exposure or critical you know windows in which gestational exposure might be uh more problematic than others. And if you um look at the two researchers most known for um their belief that acetaminphen raises the risk of ASD are Andrea Bakarelli and William

[00:54:14] Parker actually have conflicting views on the critical window of acetaminophen exposure. Uh Barelli who is the author by the way of the paper in um that came out in August that we've been talking about. He believes that maternal use during any part of pregnancy increases the risk to the fetus. While Parker believes that prenatal exposure carries relatively little risk provided the mother has a healthy liver to process the drug. Parker instead argues that the greatest risk comes with exposure in the neonatal period or even during birth itself. Basically starting from the time the umbilical cord is clamped and onward.

[00:54:50] And what do we know about dose dependency in this case? Yeah. So dose dependency which you could also think of as biological gradient um says the more you have the exposure the more you should see the outcome. Um and some studies have reported modest dose dependency based on the amount of time over which the mother was taking acetaminophen during pregnancy but the results again have been pretty inconsistent.

[00:55:16] Is there a plausible biological mechanism for exposure that might cause an effect? The mechanism of action for acetammenophen is generally pretty poorly understood. It's kind of amazing that we don't understand how such a ubiquitous drug actually lowers temperature and alleviates pain. So therefore, we don't really have uh much clarity on how it might ultimately lead to autism. That said, um its effects are mediated at least in part through inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are molecules that contribute to pain and the inflammatory response. And since prostaglandins also play a role in neurode development, some re researchers have argued um that acetaminophen leads to autism by disrupting neurodedevelopmental pathways. So again, there's no clear evidence of this um but there is at least what we would call uh biological plausibility even if at best it might be a little bit handwavy. Um this of course also leads to another criteria. The next one which is analogy where we compare the current body of evidence to another similar intervention with a more established effect. And I think here we can look at um the effect of another prostaglandin inhibitor in the CNS which is aspirin uh which is shown to have modest protective effects against autism-like symptoms in animal studies.

[00:56:46] So this potential protective effect was also seen in the Swedish cohort study that we talked about earlier in which sibling analyses showed a small but statistically significant reduction in autism risk with prenatal aspirin exposure. This was about a 13% relative risk reduction. In other words, the analogy criteria would actually argue against it based on the uh dual inhibition of prostaglandins between both of these drugs.

[00:57:16] And then wrapping this section looking at the Bradford Hill criteria. Do you want to cover the last two? Yeah, the last two don't really help us much here. Um because you know, one of them is on whether or not we have interventionbased evidence to support these conclusions, but obviously we don't. We don't have randomized control trials um that can point to subanalyses here. As an example of where we would be able to use this, if you're looking at exercise epidemiology or nutrition epidemiology, um you might not be able to answer the meta question with epidemiology, but you could do short-term well-controlled studies to show that for example like you know 6 months of exercise improved blood pressure. then you'd be more likely to believe that exercise could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease if that's what the large EPI showed. But again, we can't do the short-term studies here. Um, and then of course the final uh uh metric here is called coherence. Um, which is how do we tie the observational data with the in vitro and invivo testing. And while we have some data here, they're very inconsistent um to the question. So, you know, there are some studies that involve pre- or perinatal acetaminophen exposure in mice and rats that have reported a few neurodedevelopmental abnormalities, but they've been very inconsistent in the nature of the effect. Um, and many have aligned quite poorly with the characteristics of autism. For example, um one study showed minor alterations uh in spatial learning and locomotive activity which aren't typically associated with ASD but not anxiety- like behaviors which often do accompany

[00:58:53] ASD. Uh additionally, some of the studies have used extreme doses far exceeding the therapeutic doses used in humans uh as adults or children at all. What I think might be helpful is if you could just quickly summarize all the information we just talked about as it relates to acetaminophen and autism in looking at the Bradford Hill criteria.

[00:59:14] Okay, so let's go through them one by one. Strength uh definitely weak. Consistency moderate, specificity weak, temporality, I would say modest and probably even strong. Um biological gradient I would say moderate. plausibility I would say weak analogy actually provides evidence against uh this effect and then obviously experiment and coherence we don't really have meaningful data but if we do I would classify coherence as probably somewhat weak based on that kind of where do you land on looking at autism and acetto menophen well again to the first question I posed which is is there even a statistical association I would say possibly. Um again, obviously there is in an uncorrected or unadjusted analysis, but

[01:00:07] I'm really trying to refer to these adjusted analyses. Um so I would say yes, there's probably some association between acetaminophen and Tylenol. Uh it's not particularly large. Uh but but let's assume it is there. The the important question and the only question that really matters here is what is the probability that that association is causal? And based on everything we've just talked about and uh inclusive of the you know the running of the Bradford

[01:00:34] Hill criteria I would say the probability that the association between acetaminophen use uh by a mother and the development of autism um of her child is is a very low probability event to be causal. Again let me restate that. What that means is I think the probability that if a woman takes Tylenol during pregnancy, it's going to increase the probability that her child has autism is very low. And I'm sorry for using the word probability twice in one sentence, but that's the challenge of trying to talk about this thing technically and accurately. I hope that makes sense.

[01:01:07] I'll clarify it if it doesn't. No, I think it does. And I think what would be helpful now is kind of stepping back. So early on you mentioned that one of the things we do know is that there is an increase in cases of autism. Let's assume there is causality here. Is it enough to explain what we opened with which is a fivefold increase in the prevalence of autism today? And I I think the answer is unquestionably no. that that's that's a much more confident thing that we can say um that there is uh essentially zero chance that maternal

[01:01:46] Tylenol use is the thing quote unquote the thing in quotes responsible for the rise in autism. So um if it plays a role it would be a very small role and it would have to be in the setting of another susceptibility. Again, I still would argue that it is not playing a measurable role based on everything we've discussed.

[01:02:09] And so, Peter, I think now would be a good time to like take a look at some of those important risk factors. So, if you look at autism, what are some of the most important risk factors when it comes to that? Well, this is something I started looking into probably 3 or 4 years ago. Um, so it was kind of um actually nice to kind of go back and brush up on on this on this literature and see what had been updated. But the the the long and short of it is genetics play a much larger role in autism risk than all other variables combined and account for an estimated 80 to 90% of the interindividual variability and autism risk. Um the term for that is heritability. So the heritability of a trait can be assessed through studies that compare monozygotic twins. So identical twins and dzygotic twins. So these are fraternal twins. Um this can also be done comparing um what are called concordant discordant identical twins or monozotic twins where you take identical twins that are raised in different environments. So there's you know lots of elegant ways to do this. So what do we know? We know that monozygotic twins are obviously genetically identical whereas dzygotic twins are genetically no more closely related than any other pair of siblings.

[01:03:35] However, all twins are exposed to the same in uterero environment and in most cases also raised in the same environment. Um again I mentioned that there are some studies that do look at identical twins raised apart but let's put that off to the side. So this means that you can assume that dzygotic twins differ mostly in genetics whereas monozygotic twins don't really differ at all. Right? So again you have very elegant what we call natural experiment.

[01:04:11] So if we see that a given trait is highly correlated between monozygotic twins but is often discordant between dzygotic twins, it must have a very significant impact from genes. So I just want to pause before I go any further because so much of what I'm about to say hinges on that. So Nick, did that make sense? Do you want me to explain this beautiful natural experimental tool that we have? Yeah, I think in this case it is worth double-checking and just reconfirming things so people understand because it is such an important point and it's come up on so many podcasts we've done in the past. I can think off the top of my head of three guests we've had on the on the drive over the past five or six years where we have talked about the heritability of various things. They're almost always neuroscychiatric. So the heritability of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder. Okay. So how are they figuring this stuff out? If you have identical twins, they are in the mother at the same time. Therefore, they are exposed to all of the same things while the mother is uh carrying them.

[01:05:25] And let's just again limit this to all twins that are raised together, which most are. Then they come out and they're also exposed to the same environment. If you have dygotic twins, they're just siblings. They're genetically, you know, obviously similar, but not identical, but they were exposed to the exact same environment inside the mother, but then once they're born, they're exposed to comparable uh things outside. So, if we see that a trait is highly correlated only in the monozygotic twins, but the correlation is nowhere near as strong in the dyzgotic twins, then we know that genetics are playing the role. So let's talk about two things that everyone will appreciate. Height and body weight.

[01:06:09] Height has approximately an 80% heritability. Again, this shouldn't be surprising to people, right? We understand that on average tall parents have tall kids and short parents have short kids. Is it perfect? Not at all. But it's 80% heritable. Body weight also quite heritable though not as much. it's about 60% heritable. So, um that's what we mean by heritability. Now, in one of the studies that was included in the August paper, the review paper, um and this was the leopard paper, the primary study actually focused on how acetaminophen used during pregnancy correlated with the mother's genetic predisposition for autism. and they didn't find any significant association. But if they had, it might suggest that a woman's genetic predisposition towards autism might be the real variable behind the apparent association between acetaminophen and uh autism within the offspring. If the mother is predisposed towards autism, then the child is also likely at a higher than average risk of autism based solely on genetics. But if a genetic predisposition also increases the likelihood that the mother might use

[01:07:28] Tylenol during pregnancy, which is entirely possible given that autism is related to sensory perception, which is in turn related to pain sensing, then it would appear as if acetaminophen use and the child's risk of autism were related, even though both associations might actually be explained by genetics. And this is what I referred to above when I talked about a sort of middle uh confounding variable. The example I gave earlier about the temperature being the thing that relates ice cream consumption and drowning. In other words, genetics would constitute a confounding variable that influences both autism risk and acetaminophen use, just as temperature is the confounding variable that influences both ice cream consumption and drowning. If so much of autism risk is genetics, what can we say about genetics explaining the increase in autism rates over the past few decades?

[01:08:31] They definitely don't because genetics do not shift enough over those kinds of time scales to explain this five, six, or potentially even sevenfold increase in autism diagnosis that we've seen over basically, let's just call it two generations if you want to go back enough. Um, now some cases of autism do involve denovo mutations, but the majority of this increase seems to be explained by the increased awareness and expanded diagnostic definitions. So, let's review a little bit of history here. There has been a progressive expansion of the diagnostic criteria for autism over the last 40 years. In 1987, the DSM3 made a revision which expanded from a strict infantile autism diagnosis or definition where the symptoms must occur between 30 months of age to something called autistic disorder, which was defined by a checklist of symptoms that could manifest well beyond infancy. Then in the 1990s and into the 2000s, a series of revisions in the DSM4 uh and the ICD10 uh created something called the pervasive developmental disorder family, the PDD family, which encompassed autistic disorder, Asperers disorder, something called PDD not otherwise specified, which um I talked about on the podcast with Trena uh where you know it's it sort of became the all else bucket.

[01:10:02] Rhett's disorder and then something called childhood disintegrative disorder where kids actually go on to lose an already acquired skill. So if they acquire a language skill skill but then go on to lose it. So further expands this recognition but with very inconsistent boundaries between the subtypes. The age of onset was typically before 3 years of age. Then in 2013, the

[01:10:27] DSM5 collapsed all the PDD subtypes into a single diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder or ASD. It also relaxed the before age three requirement to symptoms in the early developmental period and it introduced certain specifiers with or without intellectual or language impairment and the severity levels were based on needed support. other changes that were also made to some of the checklist criteria, but the main issue is that an array of disorders are now lumped together under this ASD umbrella, which has vastly increased the number of individuals who fall under that umbrella. Now the estimates for how much this dramatically increasing diagnostic aperture has contributed to the increase in prevalence vary. But the analyses that have looked and attempted to assess this directly report that the expanded criteria account for 40 to 60% of the increase. And furthermore, increased awareness accounts for 20 to 30% of the increase in diagnosis. A 2009 study found that roughly 26% of the increase in autism diagnoses in California between 92 and 2005 were attributable specifically to cases in which children had previously been diagnosed with mental retardation and were then subsequently screened for autism. So again, when I hear people say, "Oh, yes, but even the cases of severe autism are increasing." Not necessarily. It could be that kids that we now think have severe autism, for example, being non-verbal, were actually previously diagnosed as something else. Um, you know, racial and socioeconomic disparities and autism diagnoses have narrowed or reversed over the last 30 years, which the CDC and others suggest is evidence of more widespread awareness and screening. So take those two together, Nick. 40 to 60%, 20 to 30%, that's really kind of the lion's share of what explains this increase.

[01:12:42] But that also still leaves room for other factors. And so do we know what else might be accounting for the increase, not what we just covered? Yeah, I think the next clearest contributor is advancing parental age. uh both in mothers and fathers although the paternal age probably seems to play a greater role. Um this is seen mostly in the US and other highincome countries. Um and various studies have put this at about 5 to 15% of the increase in autism prevalence. So um paternal age has advanced in the US from 27.6 6 years when I was born to 31.1 years 10 years ago and that proportion that that number seems to be going up.

[01:13:33] The proportion of fathers um with more advanced paternal age has also increased. So fathers over 40 at the time of offspring birth has more than doubled. um and going from 4.1% to 8.9% and fathers over 50 has also doubled going from.5% to.9%. Trends in maternal age have also increased during the same average period by about 3 years. And the CDC reports that between 2016 and 23, the proportion of uh births um due to uh the proportion of births in women aged 35 and over has increased from 10 to 12%.

[01:14:18] Furthermore, there are other factors such as maternal obesity, metabolic disease, pre-term birth, and air pollution that are also widely recognized to contribute to the remaining 15% of unattributable factors. Um, so let's talk about these just briefly, right? Maternal uh health including metabolic health is an important factor and there's no question that obesity rates among women at the time of conception have risen steadil steadily. Um, a metaanalysis of global data reports obesity rates in pregnancy have more than tripled in the last three decades from a pre990 rate of 4.7% to uh 16.3% in the decade uh from 2010 to 2020. And rates in the United States are even higher than those averages. According to a 2024 CDC report, rates of pre-term, so under 37 weeks and early term, 37 to 38 week births rose um during that period as well. So pre-term um births rose from 7.74% of all singletons in 2014 to 8.67% in 2020. while early term birth rates rose from 24.31 to 29.07%.

[01:15:42] Um, sources that track earlier years indicate a steady rise in pre-term birth from at least 1980 to 2005, after which rates dipped slightly before beginning to rise again in the 20110s. Uh, some of this, of course, could be attributed to advanced maternal age, which is in and of itself a risk factor for preterm birth.

[01:16:05] Finally, I would say globally air air pollution has been increasing. Um, we've talked about this a lot on the podcast. We talk a lot about the PM2.5s. Truthfully, we've always talked about it more through the risk of all-c causeed mortality and and cancer mortality. Um, but but here is yet another issue. So, we've seen a 38% increase in PM2.5s.

[01:16:24] Again, just for folks maybe not familiar with those that content. These are particles that are sub 2.5 microns in the air. Obviously, you can't see these things. You don't feel these things, but because of how small they are when inhaled, these particles can go all the way into the bloodstream because of their ability to go straight down into the most distal part of the air sacks of the lung and cross the diffusion barrier where oxygen and CO2 are um are transmitted. And so seeing this enormous increase in pollution driven largely by the industrialization of China and India is another part of this. And and while air pollution in the US has been coming down, we've seen in the last decade an uptick in this mostly attributed to wildfires. And so Peter, looking at what you just covered in those three buckets, in that last bucket of environmental factors, is it possible that acetaminophen could be in that bucket as well?

[01:17:22] Yes, it is possible. uh nothing I have discussed today, none of the analysis we've done or anybody has done has shown dispositively um that we can disprove the role uh the causal role between acetaminophen uh in pregnancy and the elevated autism risk. Yes, it is possible. Right? Again, as I've stated a couple of times, it is impossible to disprove anything. Right?

[01:17:52] It's there. It's we can't disprove anything here. That's the nature of of what we're doing epidemiologically. Um but the point here is look at how many other variables we have that have a either demonstrated i.e. genetically um uh or much much stronger associations um that even if acetaminophen plays some causal role it is going to be very very low. Think back to what we talked about on the absolute risk increase. This was a 0.09 absolute risk increase with a 5% relative increase. So even if you assume that to be causal, which again I don't because when the twin analysis was done, all of that vanished in addition to everything else we've talked about. um this would be a very very very small contributor relative to other modifiable things such as maternal obesity, metabolic health, air pollution, paternal and maternal age. Um so I think there are many things we should be looking at uh before this. And so,

[01:19:02] Peter, kind of as we finish this podcast, I think one thing you mentioned early on, which I think is really helpful and ultimately what a lot of people are curious about is based on everything we just talked about. What advice would you give to women who are pregnant about the use of acettophen? As a general rule, I would advise women to stop taking medications when they get pregnant. But the medications aren't the only potential threat to the unborn child. The health of the mother is also important to the unborn child. The medical conditions that these medications are intended to treat can sometimes also create problems indirectly or directly. But we have to balance that against the use of the medication and what's already being addressed. So let's take an example. Um if a woman has an elevated APOB, she should be taking a lipid-linging medication. But does she need to take that during pregnancy? I would argue no.

[01:20:01] Why? Because nine more months of additional APOB exposure are not a meaningful threat to a young woman's life. Whereas there may be some downside in suppressing her cholesterol synthesis if we're talking about a statin. Now conversely when we think about something like thyroid hormone where we've established actually quite um safe use during pregnancy if a woman is requiring thyroid hormone because she has hypothyroid to withhold that from her during pregnancy would pose enormous risk to her and by extension to the child. Now it gets interesting when we talk about other classes of drugs. So for example example GLP1 drugs they're very common and of course the question is should women stop these during pregnancy. Well I I don't think I have enough data to comment but I can tell you how one would have to think about this. Right? If a woman's taking a GLP1 receptor agonist is the difference between between her having gestational diabetes and not maybe it's considered.

[01:21:03] Of course, we would typically turn to something like metformin as a firstline therapy there where we have much more ongoing safety data. But the point here is you have to be able to consider this in a nuanced way, which is the single most important thing for the healthy development of a fetus is a healthy environment in uterero. And sometimes that may actually require the mother taking a medication. With that kind of background, might be worth going back to the historical FDA risk categories and just kind of walking through what they are again and then even highlighting a few different medications that are included in each category so people just have a much better idea of how this is done in practice. Yeah. Again, the good news is you don't have to guess here.

[01:21:49] You should be talking about this with your with your doctor. So again, that that FDA category, category A, which is again pretty small, right? We've only got about two two to 5% of drugs here. We have controlled studies in humans that demonstrate no risk to the fetus in any trimester. So again, the two most obvious here are T3, T4, prenatal vitamins, that kind of stuff. Um, then you have category B, so animal studies that for the most part show no risk, uh, or animal risk not confirmed. Uh, adequate, you know, human epidemiology that generally shows safety. Again, 15 to 25% of risk. We see a number of antibiotics in here, things like benadryil. As I mentioned, Tylenol is in here, as is metformin.

[01:22:33] Then you go to category C. We have animal studies that show some adverse effects, but no real adequate human studies. Um, and here these are drugs that are supposed to be used provided there's, you know, enough benefit for the mother to justify it. Again, this is most drugs fit in this category, 60 to 70%. So, you have something like gabapentin, amloopene, which is a blood pressure medication. Trazadone for sleep, GLP-1 agonists are in here, uh certain SSRIs or anti-depressants, and even very short-term use of narcotic pain medication. So then you have category D. So we have positive human fetal risk data, but in some cases the benefits might outweigh it. So for example a couple of seizure medications uh valproic acid and phenitoin also lithium which would be used to treat bipolar disorder uh NSAIDs which in the third trimester should be discontinued for the reasons I talked about earlier uh and even long-term use of narcotics and then finally we have category X right we have drugs where there's simply no reason for women to take these during pregnancy and again statins would be in this category methate uh and and and and drugs that also are known to cause um teratogenic uh defects in the child.

[01:23:48] One of the other things you talked about early on in the beginning was not only do you have to look at the risk of taking the medication, but you also have to balance that in terms of what what else could be going on during pregnancy. And so how do you think about the use of acetaminophen in terms of balancing the benefits that it can also cause for people who are pregnant?

[01:24:12] Yeah, I think we need to look at the other side of the equation. Uh what's the risk of not taking Tylenol during pregnancy? Uh in many cases, maybe the trade-off is just an annoying headache or some other discomfort that that uh the mother can sort of power through. And in those instances, maybe she's just better off skipping the Tylenol and trying to get to bed. But, you know, again, we can't discount the mother's well-being and the importance of that as well, not just for herself, but her well-being in the context of how important it is for the unborn child.

[01:24:42] And we certainly shouldn't trivialize the um the the likelihood and presence of more intense debilitating pain with pregnancy. Um if the pain is bad enough that she's unable to get out of bed for several days on end, that in and of itself poses a risk to the child. Um, let's not forget Tylenol is also used to reduce fever. And for this purpose, current evidence would suggest that the scales clearly tip uh in favor of using

[01:25:09] Tylenol since exposure to fever itself carries a number of known risk factors to a developing fetus. So for for example, children born to mothers who experience fevers during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, are at a significantly higher risk of certain birth defects than children um who weren't exposed to fever in in uterro. For example, various analyses have reported anywhere from 25 to 200% higher risk for cleft pallet or neural tube defects. Um, in fact, you know, prenatal exposure to fever and maternal infection are also separate risk factors for autism and other neurodedevelopmental disorders. So, several studies have reported that exposure to maternal infection is associated with an increase in autism risk by 25 to 40% while exposure to maternal fever is typically associated with an even greater risk up to 200% across most analyses. So for some research has reported that these risks are attenuated when the mothers actually take a fever reducing medicine like

[01:26:13] Tylenol. All of these associations between infection and fever exposure and autism may actually be contributing to the apparent correlation that we see between autism and autism risk. um given that acetaminophen is by far the safest option for reducing fever and pain relief during pregnancy because remember

[01:26:32] NSAIDs and opioids are category D. So if a woman does have an infection during pregnancy, there's a good chance she might try to ease the fever or the aches with with Tylenol. And in other words, it could be that it's the infection that is the issue and the signal we're picking up and measuring is the acetaminophen use. As we finish and wrap this podcast, is there anything else based on what we covered you want to share with listeners and viewers?

[01:27:00] Look, there are some people who might be wondering, why did you just take so long to explain all this to us? Why don't you just give us the answer? Like, I just want the sound bite, man. And it's like, um, if you just want sound bites, you're never going to learn. And honestly, if you just want sound bites, this isn't the podcast for you. But if you, um, actually want to be able to learn to think for yourself, then that's what we're here to do. And that's the reason we killed ourselves over the past week to put together, you know, the most thorough uh gathering of all the data we could find and the most intense, you know, night weekend analysis possible. U it's because we want to help you think about this stuff because this is not going away, right? This is going to be a forever game of whack-a-ole. There is always going to be a bad guy. And I'm not going to be here every time to do a two-hour podcast on helping you think through why exposure X leads to disease

[01:28:00] Y. So, you know, I don't want to sound like a a scolding teacher, but the truth of the matter is we live in a world today where people don't want to think, right? People use stupid vehicles like social media to get their information and they don't want to read the fine print. And even if they do read the fine print, they they just want to outsource thinking to somebody else. So, um I appreciate that those of you who are still watching this have outsourced your thinking for the past couple of hours to me, but honestly, like we're never going to get out of this rut of people not knowing how to think critically unless everybody starts taking steps to try practicing this on their own. Um, we're going to include amazing show notes to this podcast like we do for every podcast, although for this episode it'll be uh not behind a payw wall. Normally our our show notes are only there for our subscribers. Um, but I would encourage you to go through this and follow the logic as as as I've laid it out here with the help of my team. Um, and when the next thing comes up, because it will come up, right? Whether it's, you know, this drug or that drug or this intervention that it's just going to keep happening over and over again. But you you've got to be able to kind of go through this type of thinking. And um if you don't want to, that's fine. It is hard. Um but then I think you've sort of forfeited your right to have an opinion on it. So um again, I don't mean to sound like a a crotchety old man, but honestly, I think on a day like today, I kind of feel like it. Let me just put a bow on this and let's land this plane. I think the upshot here is that any one potential risk uh for autism can't be considered an isolation. um you have to look at the the full picture, the risk of a given intervention like Tylenol as well as the potential risks of not taking Tylenol as well as the nature and magnitude of those risks. For minor aches and pains, maybe it's best to just air on the side of caution and skip the acetaminophen.

[01:29:55] Whereas when the pain becomes really a nuisance and it might interfere with you doing things that are otherwise going to help you provide the best environment for your fetus then judicious use of acetaminophen uh acetaminophen can help with the oversight of your physician. I think for maternal fever the balance is clearly leaning towards the use of acetaminophen. But I want people to understand that the the the strength of these associations is very small and in many cases vanishes all together when you apply some rigorous statistical corrections that look at the most important variables that we should be considering here which is genetic and environmental. So I hope that this exercise has indeed provided benefit to uh to all of you not just as we consider this particular question but as we consider the onslaught of questions that we're going to see in the future.
